0x5be5a8f32ebc3d14f1fce9ae341ba8bf28dea7c7 part i chapter i on an exceptionally hot evening early in july a young man came out of the garret in which he lodged in s. place and walked slowly, as though in hesitation, towards k. bridge.
0x0f3cc46a1a8a112005d2eed0eb5dbb827764b99b he had successfully avoided meeting his landlady on the staircase.
0xdd96440310ed433d409b140b1198286505c6991c his garret was under the roof of a high, five-storied house and was more like a cupboard than a room.
0xf0b370c607e5e511400304574d3db4ab66f14b7b the landlady who provided him with garret, dinners, and attendance, lived on the floor below, and every time he went out he was obliged to pass her kitchen, the door of which invariably stood open.
0xa7f1f2a8bc7981cbda0c1f416a08196b127a550f and each time he passed, the young man had a sick, frightened feeling, which made him scowl and feel ashamed.
0x0e41d54c3d830979dc30a89480fedc324a3154b4 he was hopelessly in debt to his landlady, and was afraid of meeting her.
0x49d3eebaa1d90fc302c798ae270fa3319f2fad9f this was not because he was cowardly and abject, quite the contrary; but for some time past he had been in an overstrained irritable condition, verging on hypochondria.
0x2aa63aadaf205d77b939aeeb77c866a28738b116 he had become so completely absorbed in himself, and isolated from his fellows that he dreaded meeting, not only his landlady, but anyone at all.
0xf9b5e264faf7a6062999dfab6ca393f7d2a960ca he was crushed by poverty, but the anxieties of his position had of late ceased to weigh upon him.
0xe81b728d1fab1a37321cdb315257a06de6edaa4a he had given up attending to matters of practical importance; he had lost all desire to do so.
0x190a066e3c1ec3b9e927c03db75681baf6be39fd nothing that any landlady could do had a real terror for him.
0x24b7fb665dd1b76652c10a2a19aba3d5cd4018e7 but to be stopped on the stairs, to be forced to listen to her trivial, irrelevant gossip, to pestering demands for payment, threats and complaints, and to rack his brains for excuses, to prevaricate, to lie--no, rather than that, he would creep down the stairs like a cat and slip out unseen.
0xf2a7d30b31101bbfd213bab825dab04fa45edcf8 this evening, however, on coming out into the street, he became acutely aware of his fears.
0x0164982821bd2dd9346b2a36a17e057f84540669 “i want to attempt a thing _like that_ and am frightened by these trifles,” he thought, with an odd smile.
0x53cd05c286a77566a95e40b93ca4d9d51f67a1d0 “hm... yes, all is in a man’s hands and he lets it all slip from cowardice, that’s an axiom.
0x2ed60ab39db684f2dd41305571d6f724ef0dc4e4 it would be interesting to know what it is men are most afraid of.
0xaadb30da7b725e176a36c11088adceb377085e52 taking a new step, uttering a new word is what they fear most.... but i am talking too much.
0xaeb4273e33bbb95f6850b02811bb25a2d410666d it’s because i chatter that i do nothing.
0xe1629e280ed9c8e3b1817f47920ec53f2f9ca8a2 or perhaps it is that i chatter because i do nothing.
0x3ac2f4a42651c9f9cb3b601be4a395e062e5b3a2 i’ve learned to chatter this last month, lying for days together in my den thinking... of jack the giant-killer.
0xf0e04bdef4fa3402dc2806b64f6f02d1d448f645 why am i going there now?
0x659a32d97c47783acb1c26e62589371dd61c293e am i capable of _that_?
0x1ec7388a82e4075f225eedc379b15942cb3b761d is _that_ serious?
0x851a579cd15351cd2c0b577244d694ca70d7b4c1 it is not serious at all.
0x77dcece80d804d0f056533ebbb97fa7f402f6f3e it’s simply a fantasy to amuse myself; a plaything!
0x581bb671615ec097603a2cb9385b1b8b23ef4b23 yes, maybe it is a plaything.”
0x78b8710ac93b6707ca4133e1f36a6b68f0327df1 the heat in the street was terrible: and the airlessness, the bustle and the plaster, scaffolding, bricks, and dust all about him, and that special petersburg stench, so familiar to all who are unable to get out of town in summer--all worked painfully upon the young man’s already overwrought nerves.
0xddd300746de31550e520b5624c116461d115c4a4 the insufferable stench from the pot-houses, which are particularly numerous in that part of the town, and the drunken men whom he met continually, although it was a working day, completed the revolting misery of the picture.
0x2fae1f31b486c8d3445b5b999ce7454090ef1d5f an expression of the profoundest disgust gleamed for a moment in the young man’s refined face.
0x1af4177c375cd18dbaa362ea061204a1217057eb he was, by the way, exceptionally handsome, above the average in height, slim, well-built, with beautiful dark eyes and dark brown hair.
0x187e905caf55774ae8e76390b9082cbc16dc50a0 soon he sank into deep thought, or more accurately speaking into a complete blankness of mind; he walked along not observing what was about him and not caring to observe it.
0xa24bfca61c4e00f3d56b42efc4aacc491f65c9ca from time to time, he would mutter something, from the habit of talking to himself, to which he had just confessed.
0x766028ce2547b0ccd24404deca4732e547241c8a at these moments he would become conscious that his ideas were sometimes in a tangle and that he was very weak; for two days he had scarcely tasted food.
0x634334521bf83b5848bdb0f023e0f8b52f1b17c2 he was so badly dressed that even a man accustomed to shabbiness would have been ashamed to be seen in the street in such rags.
0xb6fbe0a4da08cb3f2c405b44c867e3797342b901 in that quarter of the town, however, scarcely any shortcoming in dress would have created surprise.
0xd7f450082d03064fb3345d4786190e314ef6571a owing to the proximity of the hay market, the number of establishments of bad character, the preponderance of the trading and working class population crowded in these streets and alleys in the heart of petersburg, types so various were to be seen in the streets that no figure, however queer, would have caused surprise.
0xe0f8177bbdd015ee68163128eb586ba1096f04e2 but there was such accumulated bitterness and contempt in the young man’s heart, that, in spite of all the fastidiousness of youth, he minded his rags least of all in the street.
0xadf7a4b0d266987710d2ec2a5a0a04c696706c4b it was a different matter when he met with acquaintances or with former fellow students, whom, indeed, he disliked meeting at any time.
0x9c83e778acd2e24d483c3f9d3a69f080083b79be and yet when a drunken man who, for some unknown reason, was being taken somewhere in a huge waggon dragged by a heavy dray horse, suddenly shouted at him as he drove past: “hey there, german hatter” bawling at the top of his voice and pointing at him--the young man stopped suddenly and clutched tremulously at his hat.
0xddb5d352ee7d17a9bfaaa7d74f61825d498d446f it was a tall round hat from zimmerman’s, but completely worn out, rusty with age, all torn and bespattered, brimless and bent on one side in a most unseemly fashion.
0x1a32d4d9a2c645a1204a21b32b1b73fce7380664 not shame, however, but quite another feeling akin to terror had overtaken him.
0x42ad6150e72ce8c62f14b2fb0de7aff632ac7c59 “i knew it,” he muttered in confusion, “i thought so!
0x55017f881cd9a66c213354c7a103be17d6327b16 that’s the worst of all!
0x2c258316378011eca76f2bc51d6759fbf729c763 why, a stupid thing like this, the most trivial detail might spoil the whole plan.
0xe7c0dfcf5ec54c4c7430788ef5a7754daac8b468 yes, my hat is too noticeable.... it looks absurd and that makes it noticeable.... with my rags i ought to wear a cap, any sort of old pancake, but not this grotesque thing.
0x407b940a1e30eca64c2b3115eff5f82bddb382f2 nobody wears such a hat, it would be noticed a mile off, it would be remembered.... what matters is that people would remember it, and that would give them a clue.
0x086c717795d9d3412da582ad7b7e6381c2d8adde for this business one should be as little conspicuous as possible.... trifles, trifles are what matter!
0xde132fde6d876252c6dbc5fa197356a4b353779b why, it’s just such trifles that always ruin everything....” he had not far to go; he knew indeed how many steps it was from the gate of his lodging house: exactly seven hundred and thirty.
0x0e97528136daf7be5d7e6fa1cc630906a3341613 he had counted them once when he had been lost in dreams.
0xca68eb4bade93dc57e720f1f8e916a2af376ae1f at the time he had put no faith in those dreams and was only tantalising himself by their hideous but daring recklessness.
0x584041fa8958411ce17241ae926aeba552f6f8fb now, a month later, he had begun to look upon them differently, and, in spite of the monologues in which he jeered at his own impotence and indecision, he had involuntarily come to regard this “hideous” dream as an exploit to be attempted, although he still did not realise this himself.
0xc5db33bef131673304f1d1ae0f7aa300f0270e42 he was positively going now for a “rehearsal” of his project, and at every step his excitement grew more and more violent.
0xe0422e77990c98680379d29fc3b1fd54ca14815c with a sinking heart and a nervous tremor, he went up to a huge house which on one side looked on to the canal, and on the other into the street.
0x23b86ee0ea24df0911054386765489b3cd892883 this house was let out in tiny tenements and was inhabited by working people of all kinds--tailors, locksmiths, cooks, germans of sorts, girls picking up a living as best they could, petty clerks, etc.
0x095190cb7f51e4561607ec93b363d881dc255a98 there was a continual coming and going through the two gates and in the two courtyards of the house.
0x6d2244e7ff5770dbfe39f6d099a8dab34a68d526 three or four door-keepers were employed on the building.
0xfd6f72e356ccf95be63ece22dcbb642e6ef22fd4 the young man was very glad to meet none of them, and at once slipped unnoticed through the door on the right, and up the staircase.
0x2c5163079bcfb88156a92d67efb9b6db448e9793 it was a back staircase, dark and narrow, but he was familiar with it already, and knew his way, and he liked all these surroundings: in such darkness even the most inquisitive eyes were not to be dreaded.
0xad66d7bc2b7e2f61b094ff2a573dba2abc1d10ca “if i am so scared now, what would it be if it somehow came to pass that i were really going to do it?”
0xa600d2cdca3fb71bb730ef13e27e99387c43e8a5 he could not help asking himself as he reached the fourth storey.
0x22b9776f995452b9c9fe3226d83100d1ba0bbd58 there his progress was barred by some porters who were engaged in moving furniture out of a flat.
0x1b7d80031b523edbd5dfeb5758a3acb8b6c25d0d he knew that the flat had been occupied by a german clerk in the civil service, and his family.
0x3793345e612a5a2242fdd1d97ed2015ffbafdbad this german was moving out then, and so the fourth floor on this staircase would be untenanted except by the old woman.
0xcfa951841b763b7ac7dc5de32e5fe627ab21fb0c “that’s a good thing anyway,” he thought to himself, as he rang the bell of the old woman’s flat.
0xb80f73b7f3dc159db3a294d4daf4467cb5276da0 the bell gave a faint tinkle as though it were made of tin and not of copper.
0x2d669c615259f33db179eb5043da05e941480817 the little flats in such houses always have bells that ring like that.
0x084e365c496a5e9f4732f5b5d0ae765019976cc1 he had forgotten the note of that bell, and now its peculiar tinkle seemed to remind him of something and to bring it clearly before him.... he started, his nerves were terribly overstrained by now.
0xd487aa958b2f6c6949716b48561bc1e0f9452399 in a little while, the door was opened a tiny crack: the old woman eyed her visitor with evident distrust through the crack, and nothing could be seen but her little eyes, glittering in the darkness.
0xb98f50049075f3c30830a7d428042bd817152e1b but, seeing a number of people on the landing, she grew bolder, and opened the door wide.
0xd6ed060ee6ca862b969435453bdc467e0229f37f the young man stepped into the dark entry, which was partitioned off from the tiny kitchen.
0x27d1f38994531a791154e7570329126e6c597613 the old woman stood facing him in silence and looking inquiringly at him.
0xa24f558dee765eaafe387a08ebe6d0d6bafd15a3 she was a diminutive, withered up old woman of sixty, with sharp malignant eyes and a sharp little nose.
0x3285ee67d51ad6b2e011747cfb1a120f62a3b974 her colourless, somewhat grizzled hair was thickly smeared with oil, and she wore no kerchief over it.
0x668a79d087b7725b92cded062595a5700bdb678e round her thin long neck, which looked like a hen’s leg, was knotted some sort of flannel rag, and, in spite of the heat, there hung flapping on her shoulders, a mangy fur cape, yellow with age.
0x70aa47e7e62d50d8591b16623fc1eb7dfb7c9eee the old woman coughed and groaned at every instant.
0xdaefb2fd4e01286d237ff6038ee26843b0c37d6f the young man must have looked at her with a rather peculiar expression, for a gleam of mistrust came into her eyes again.
0xeac87bc177acf33abad172e59aaa5b0c83e075b2 “raskolnikov, a student, i came here a month ago,” the young man made haste to mutter, with a half bow, remembering that he ought to be more polite.
0x75f944713efa3f11a232e08a3346f7b9d6432450 “i remember, my good sir, i remember quite well your coming here,” the old woman said distinctly, still keeping her inquiring eyes on his face.
0xb8aff5745e9ddbc4c511b618d354d0d64d5d9051 “and here... i am again on the same errand,” raskolnikov continued, a little disconcerted and surprised at the old woman’s mistrust.
0xb1b893a0d988e090285c8e604a6b881f993f4b6b “perhaps she is always like that though, only i did not notice it the other time,” he thought with an uneasy feeling.
0xea4dc239ae3b3cfa97986877e7267013a2caee7c the old woman paused, as though hesitating; then stepped on one side, and pointing to the door of the room, she said, letting her visitor pass in front of her: “step in, my good sir.”
0xb990a12d3ae25646ddd547c52929f2fae9608f1e the little room into which the young man walked, with yellow paper on the walls, geraniums and muslin curtains in the windows, was brightly lighted up at that moment by the setting sun.
0xacecb1756cc248ab120df2c9721ea52d431dbc79 “so the sun will shine like this _then_ too!”
0x0bb456f7c47dfd3c7e11fcb2b4432b1d5ef675e4 flashed as it were by chance through raskolnikov’s mind, and with a rapid glance he scanned everything in the room, trying as far as possible to notice and remember its arrangement.
0xf36e4f689c425c234ec339e793d48d12daaeca3d but there was nothing special in the room.
0x44a3a9d26f0760b0f7fb3f02477efa352b8235b3 the furniture, all very old and of yellow wood, consisted of a sofa with a huge bent wooden back, an oval table in front of the sofa, a dressing-table with a looking-glass fixed on it between the windows, chairs along the walls and two or three half-penny prints in yellow frames, representing german damsels with birds in their hands--that was all.
0xd28a6a5cc82258b718811791808d5c62f6f21bb6 in the corner a light was burning before a small ikon.
0xc0e180eea0fcb97cdfc7596b3baffa7a337f9198 everything was very clean; the floor and the furniture were brightly polished; everything shone.
0x4611b54470b7094f24f86032b0563cba7b3fcc73 “lizaveta’s work,” thought the young man.
0xcc277dd8c81383d2dd8a4d4e52a02e69ba753c90 there was not a speck of dust to be seen in the whole flat.
0x84ade183aa56854778aaaeb4d6ce8e83eb2372a3 “it’s in the houses of spiteful old widows that one finds such cleanliness,” raskolnikov thought again, and he stole a curious glance at the cotton curtain over the door leading into another tiny room, in which stood the old woman’s bed and chest of drawers and into which he had never looked before.
0xaa49cef8c29879f26f257449bb83ff61b8d18883 these two rooms made up the whole flat.
0x721ede191520c07dca21bffcf2c4a846f673e300 “what do you want?”
0x236fdf911234d7f3e4b0b2b3de1a62e2f4d9ce9e the old woman said severely, coming into the room and, as before, standing in front of him so as to look him straight in the face.
0x3c89860e3850ea6e11a3942f3eee747a6cd7600c “i’ve brought something to pawn here,” and he drew out of his pocket an old-fashioned flat silver watch, on the back of which was engraved a globe; the chain was of steel.
0xc157a6c9add67d28ccc0872ad30c425bdbf26888 “but the time is up for your last pledge.
0x4d615521faa0b46b3fa4a5560e3f61b15719adcf the month was up the day before yesterday.”
0x14b7cb997eae89b1342e15920e8c9c668e3ed1b8 “i will bring you the interest for another month; wait a little.”
0x1041195f1715db10c0d8bb98dee313ec84f054f9 “but that’s for me to do as i please, my good sir, to wait or to sell your pledge at once.”
0x9a2e1e8cd86033c1bd62c4fc645fdf3e001434ce “how much will you give me for the watch, alyona ivanovna?”
0x09a0c21d6b373873904638fb97b57e20c5759dba “you come with such trifles, my good sir, it’s scarcely worth anything.
0x0d86ced2ff0e87875e5032f87acb862f10fcc0d7 i gave you two roubles last time for your ring and one could buy it quite new at a jeweler’s for a rouble and a half.”
0x6863ddc6108dedc6dd3cd2f7e332103b1d47e44e “give me four roubles for it, i shall redeem it, it was my father’s.
0x669fa4a858ec2f6ce26703faf8060001ae9d40fb i shall be getting some money soon.”
0xf3d16e3b08fa4f9b71e3ba2f21cea5cbfd3c8777 “a rouble and a half, and interest in advance, if you like!”
0x185c6c5f66eeaffb8c756f7d792e83570d776d0a “a rouble and a half!”
0x89e1ea80ef910ab877984b87c5c55ac3b2b90dbb cried the young man.
0xb89cead11ac4d26f05651c30c5e5732619e7a55c “please yourself”--and the old woman handed him back the watch.
0xd301332923b45c6b9bda5dac8b954102d662f7c2 the young man took it, and was so angry that he was on the point of going away; but checked himself at once, remembering that there was nowhere else he could go, and that he had had another object also in coming.
0xea78d6e078adb4823e740900312cdd17b5521479 “hand it over,” he said roughly.
0x18d67679b04532761b1d168cce49c2263391bc27 the old woman fumbled in her pocket for her keys, and disappeared behind the curtain into the other room.
0x3129a10dd3d46d7f7867f0ef360589d204b366da the young man, left standing alone in the middle of the room, listened inquisitively, thinking.
0x5ab6e99be323f14ad08c1ae4f66f6bff1724a4d2 he could hear her unlocking the chest of drawers.
0x5bc4506d9119f52fae6396f094e7833e39a79b96 “it must be the top drawer,” he reflected.
0x199e7d49326980f45e6164f70ab6055a75958c87 “so she carries the keys in a pocket on the right.
0x91b4d5759d48b1da273724bb43bacebe9e7220f0 all in one bunch on a steel ring.... and there’s one key there, three times as big as all the others, with deep notches; that can’t be the key of the chest of drawers... then there must be some other chest or strong-box... that’s worth knowing.
0x59e468166c9e0cf2ff086e52e1b3c9ccbf80c427 strong-boxes always have keys like that... but how degrading it all is.”
0x86441b7d87fa6d41c83765f7f04dd0f8dfa255d6 the old woman came back.
0xde4ce46b7a6d9897c87073d5296a33f5c3375198 “here, sir: as we say ten copecks the rouble a month, so i must take fifteen copecks from a rouble and a half for the month in advance.
0x201b9d2b90f5101ab066148e24763fd41fc0cc0b but for the two roubles i lent you before, you owe me now twenty copecks on the same reckoning in advance.
0xe6c4f5aa33066ee8178457430b9c93270420186b that makes thirty-five copecks altogether.
0x87a3f57a2a6b5076f067cecf33bc83491b4d946a so i must give you a rouble and fifteen copecks for the watch.

0xe5223fdb02d9ee9ecf8a04f7116dd98e3afde8a1 “what!
0xa474e27f2f9cb9e35b1fded9053bcae1aa390fe7 only a rouble and fifteen copecks now!”
0xa6613922d2af56a5abec04943c36ddbc90e4d3de “just so.”
0x6174e9880bd56c0effb0f69f314bb0ae2b902e7a the young man did not dispute it and took the money.
0x5707ac601ee77a2ec45bf00871d773a04862e229 he looked at the old woman, and was in no hurry to get away, as though there was still something he wanted to say or to do, but he did not himself quite know what.
0x1b9097e23ac1c1e0841741506ae3094beb998781 “i may be bringing you something else in a day or two, alyona ivanovna--a valuable thing--silver--a cigarette-box, as soon as i get it back from a friend...” he broke off in confusion.
0xc8aeea1a979d2a689713bcdf5909c697c9adcf40 “well, we will talk about it then, sir.”
0x0b20deef42e57c16a5cc243642e6074d56666463 “good-bye--are you always at home alone, your sister is not here with you?”
0x91b156aecee7a23c4698acdefb5f96ec092c1c55 he asked her as casually as possible as he went out into the passage.
0x4525e1109fea960f51274caf79389812359c59ab “what business is she of yours, my good sir?”
0xbe2b255b176679f408054ae9b162b39e1893dc74 “oh, nothing particular, i simply asked.
0x2e8faec96ec05db4ffb5271018b3884c7ca608a6 you are too quick.... good-day, alyona ivanovna.”
0x533157d82fd16c5a2976afbefeab55501f59cfd6 raskolnikov went out in complete confusion.
0x7240707bb5614ab57e19fb7051589eaad631f3c3 this confusion became more and more intense.
0xd9806a2eb026572579895dad32c6430c723e5b20 as he went down the stairs, he even stopped short, two or three times, as though suddenly struck by some thought.
0xa56071e088f1996abaf99d39a34033b5b2476199 when he was in the street he cried out, “oh, god, how loathsome it all is!
0x3f36100b4d6fafb30fd76605da6d1e2964e46b2f and can i, can i possibly.... no, it’s nonsense, it’s rubbish!”
0xf12659cdfaa7b3953a51e92fa19aad7442aecb27 he added resolutely.
0x1da195c7f3427c5435fbcaca7c12e838cf59730b “and how could such an atrocious thing come into my head?
0xe736a3f30778e4be825bda7ddbda0a08bde568f0 what filthy things my heart is capable of.
0x42dd188e2d9ff80d539de6c58f708388e10cd4ea yes, filthy above all, disgusting, loathsome, loathsome!--and for a whole month i’ve been....” but no words, no exclamations, could express his agitation.
0x5f7e42e96fb9b6306a973e37196a7ba0019cb89a the feeling of intense repulsion, which had begun to oppress and torture his heart while he was on his way to the old woman, had by now reached such a pitch and had taken such a definite form that he did not know what to do with himself to escape from his wretchedness.
0x4ae7f1f370942528c7aec4e36b6fa43d7cf3cb1c he walked along the pavement like a drunken man, regardless of the passers-by, and jostling against them, and only came to his senses when he was in the next street.
0xdeaf73dd3dcce9a5765bd38676225362ad3f3a06 looking round, he noticed that he was standing close to a tavern which was entered by steps leading from the pavement to the basement.
0xf64c7a0f2cc2263b8c76da235b08e524cf5efd78 at that instant two drunken men came out at the door, and abusing and supporting one another, they mounted the steps.
0x027a9b259253c2f32be218f96b29cd922b479045 without stopping to think, raskolnikov went down the steps at once.
0xd19253dfd6d71df5bdaf06272b4626d1f524655c till that moment he had never been into a tavern, but now he felt giddy and was tormented by a burning thirst.
0xf0bd698aa4deacf640ea8e5fb02de2053fcf6975 he longed for a drink of cold beer, and attributed his sudden weakness to the want of food.
0x3f59093ad54c6d2dfb1f003db58422a1293e72e7 he sat down at a sticky little table in a dark and dirty corner; ordered some beer, and eagerly drank off the first glassful.
0x6a8bcb4b3e8a5b9198a9f05c416cf8e4f0a4f71e at once he felt easier; and his thoughts became clear.
0xb95475a6fe9f420a9c7515fc0f8a4a9bc63557b2 “all that’s nonsense,” he said hopefully, “and there is nothing in it all to worry about!
0x16696614c7910f78b38d1663ab8ae95cd45f1d48 it’s simply physical derangement.
0xd0d62d9925e513cc69f5452808d85986f36cbef2 just a glass of beer, a piece of dry bread--and in one moment the brain is stronger, the mind is clearer and the will is firm!
0x29377b3dd8ce4fe4582bd47ac6f33f11fdc5783b phew, how utterly petty it all is!”
0x21a1408d4db1377304346edad2d7783fa4b13eee but in spite of this scornful reflection, he was by now looking cheerful as though he were suddenly set free from a terrible burden: and he gazed round in a friendly way at the people in the room.
0x6dda62f2c5c5c125486edc14c6825465b3e42022 but even at that moment he had a dim foreboding that this happier frame of mind was also not normal.
0xf00e1333aa3817ade7a0451cb519dd55084cee95 there were few people at the time in the tavern.
0xc878d2e5a1c440d77df97ddbf8a695a7758b99db besides the two drunken men he had met on the steps, a group consisting of about five men and a girl with a concertina had gone out at the same time.
0xe21206a7481115b0d617848892e7f1021851a133 their departure left the room quiet and rather empty.
0x3821882ab17f6e157945712446a45f3e2a54d139 the persons still in the tavern were a man who appeared to be an artisan, drunk, but not extremely so, sitting before a pot of beer, and his companion, a huge, stout man with a grey beard, in a short full-skirted coat.
0x6b71dd6ad33a26235f7a4d2634d5cf8588f1ae89 he was very drunk: and had dropped asleep on the bench; every now and then, he began as though in his sleep, cracking his fingers, with his arms wide apart and the upper part of his body bounding about on the bench, while he hummed some meaningless refrain, trying to recall some such lines as these: “his wife a year he fondly loved his wife a--a year he--fondly loved.”
0xc3cdc98ddca34bd2310dd7091bea69b64a245cb4 or suddenly waking up again: “walking along the crowded row he met the one he used to know.”
0xd44981178c30e39916949f76bc27f8373d0dab58 but no one shared his enjoyment: his silent companion looked with positive hostility and mistrust at all these manifestations.
0xf106a7b9ce75e79d6620aebf48753cdae113635b there was another man in the room who looked somewhat like a retired government clerk.
0xec72869732d66bd14f96d5f37ca12e3adabcac79 he was sitting apart, now and then sipping from his pot and looking round at the company.
0x6dcace0c940671bd16d543767ddb58b2da23cb39 he, too, appeared to be in some agitation.
0x93053d5a58c5e4b30da5b0bf73eb071abca2079b chapter ii raskolnikov was not used to crowds, and, as we said before, he avoided society of every sort, more especially of late.
0x7dfc669d7d78c85e79e6097219cc0bf25baaa625 but now all at once he felt a desire to be with other people.
0xbec7eaa7015782fb79f4b72334b8037af2763a05 something new seemed to be taking place within him, and with it he felt a sort of thirst for company.
0xd9c32691e21c84662065f79feaab09b628ff4d40 he was so weary after a whole month of concentrated wretchedness and gloomy excitement that he longed to rest, if only for a moment, in some other world, whatever it might be; and, in spite of the filthiness of the surroundings, he was glad now to stay in the tavern.
0x815641529615dd0bc14a794f78f223e620ad18bf the master of the establishment was in another room, but he frequently came down some steps into the main room, his jaunty, tarred boots with red turn-over tops coming into view each time before the rest of his person.
0x42d951c7aaebd5fa6b344b9081e21f3d55625c50 he wore a full coat and a horribly greasy black satin waistcoat, with no cravat, and his whole face seemed smeared with oil like an iron lock.
0xc5ab2f2f82f52c93b87b0193bac54d6c6c7b7cb4 at the counter stood a boy of about fourteen, and there was another boy somewhat younger who handed whatever was wanted.
0x7804aedc4a357f6b88ceca31ed339b5a028ec34e on the counter lay some sliced cucumber, some pieces of dried black bread, and some fish, chopped up small, all smelling very bad.
0xff520fa062e2a374609244266f1bd7f42f60f884 it was insufferably close, and so heavy with the fumes of spirits that five minutes in such an atmosphere might well make a man drunk.
0x4332c46a8dc46aa267f602f19014ed4cdb1f7c01 there are chance meetings with strangers that interest us from the first moment, before a word is spoken.
0xea13091213924ae4afd5a30f59d394e10b262aa3 such was the impression made on raskolnikov by the person sitting a little distance from him, who looked like a retired clerk.
0x86efdd62445c37c5279eeacc81d065c26cf92f89 the young man often recalled this impression afterwards, and even ascribed it to presentiment.
0x8294ae5ca58145989349ab4d8e59a33440c0321c he looked repeatedly at the clerk, partly no doubt because the latter was staring persistently at him, obviously anxious to enter into conversation.
0x2b2427c5a4255ff09ebdb1a2e76ea1c41bb94569 at the other persons in the room, including the tavern-keeper, the clerk looked as though he were used to their company, and weary of it, showing a shade of condescending contempt for them as persons of station and culture inferior to his own, with whom it would be useless for him to converse.
0xa1827fb6748c60daefcb3d21e0096dfba12c3923 he was a man over fifty, bald and grizzled, of medium height, and stoutly built.
0x56eacb29fb305be6acb9514ab319a9ea1ce754e5 his face, bloated from continual drinking, was of a yellow, even greenish, tinge, with swollen eyelids out of which keen reddish eyes gleamed like little chinks.
0xcd5fac9d766545e50fe09b646e7b24f6c3c873c8 but there was something very strange in him; there was a light in his eyes as though of intense feeling--perhaps there were even thought and intelligence, but at the same time there was a gleam of something like madness.
0xc1e423b9dbf41a1284934972e84bd0559fa23479 he was wearing an old and hopelessly ragged black dress coat, with all its buttons missing except one, and that one he had buttoned, evidently clinging to this last trace of respectability.
0xd6be7d3a30c2058f5958817cf7857305b34bb4d6 a crumpled shirt front, covered with spots and stains, protruded from his canvas waistcoat.
0xf19fa7e1e0d4cc9133764df95f1f37827ef96b39 like a clerk, he wore no beard, nor moustache, but had been so long unshaven that his chin looked like a stiff greyish brush.
0x915f37d7007716307555e5bb5c1adf424cd060f9 and there was something respectable and like an official about his manner too.
0x9d8a82bd46f2aa8b6d6f9ae6f1e221f59484a755 but he was restless; he ruffled up his hair and from time to time let his head drop into his hands dejectedly resting his ragged elbows on the stained and sticky table.
0xc4749a7e0d9bb60c7b691e0c1fa5ec0866fae510 at last he looked straight at raskolnikov, and said loudly and resolutely: “may i venture, honoured sir, to engage you in polite conversation?
0xd42a44dd87affd98232e0ad89d13768565c9133a forasmuch as, though your exterior would not command respect, my experience admonishes me that you are a man of education and not accustomed to drinking.
0x3307a994ce45fefb910856487a02fac56ccdb75c i have always respected education when in conjunction with genuine sentiments, and i am besides a titular counsellor in rank.
0x64014e270c8f09bdb88796f557ef7ea39e631801 marmeladov--such is my name; titular counsellor.
0xb022157d28946e2e36aab9ce15ace9de138b9133 i make bold to inquire--have you been in the service?”
0xb4aad7275af46b10219b20fce3981a1d7ae535e8 “no, i am studying,” answered the young man, somewhat surprised at the grandiloquent style of the speaker and also at being so directly addressed.
0x9ffdc7791251cf31546b8d9250495608333843bb in spite of the momentary desire he had just been feeling for company of any sort, on being actually spoken to he felt immediately his habitual irritable and uneasy aversion for any stranger who approached or attempted to approach him.
0x531c5fd6f94e3db5ebbc9bf26576e56c4f2b377e “a student then, or formerly a student,” cried the clerk.
0xff166cecf55eb21c29bd9ce42458e7fb6e6b4f71 “just what i thought!
0x083086a2da17ac57bc6fba29087b633a2e1b2f40 i’m a man of experience, immense experience, sir,” and he tapped his forehead with his fingers in self-approval.
0x7b8d3f4354c1a337c03cf832e481db516799b2f1 “you’ve been a student or have attended some learned institution!... but allow me....” he got up, staggered, took up his jug and glass, and sat down beside the young man, facing him a little sideways.
0xf5ea901df4615865b370810136e66e105735a261 he was drunk, but spoke fluently and boldly, only occasionally losing the thread of his sentences and drawling his words.
0xcd3999b781c855380e38e07427c278f6d76cf671 he pounced upon raskolnikov as greedily as though he too had not spoken to a soul for a month.
0xfe1459c6e34b7e636a4cea9bc2ba018e2510c2c5 “honoured sir,” he began almost with solemnity, “poverty is not a vice, that’s a true saying.
0x270c6ec66fa335808684dd82bd1c7d0e7f69ea22 yet i know too that drunkenness is not a virtue, and that that’s even truer.
0xa930371832551fe639342060781a559de9beaad4 but beggary, honoured sir, beggary is a vice.
0xfa60cf642275aef6dd149900bf02933238089b52 in poverty you may still retain your innate nobility of soul, but in beggary--never--no one.
0x55169197b47e4502416cdc30f6f70eb91587c289 for beggary a man is not chased out of human society with a stick, he is swept out with a broom, so as to make it as humiliating as possible; and quite right, too, forasmuch as in beggary i am ready to be the first to humiliate myself.
0xa18c8419527ed288853632779e2882e7b2066fb1 hence the pot-house!
0x84c6bae8f08ca41a5be24c61f0b7e968d499c34f honoured sir, a month ago mr. lebeziatnikov gave my wife a beating, and my wife is a very different matter from me!
0x358ecff058614831827cca0c207c360691d81ab6 do you understand?
0xea86109ebf112190e0021a6b4275fb3566b0fe62 allow me to ask you another question out of simple curiosity: have you ever spent a night on a hay barge, on the neva?”
0x8976f3a3ed86f920fcdcadd3de5bf8d6c37b1dfe “no, i have not happened to,” answered raskolnikov.
0xbf88212b1ff5a8b9eaea9de92afa0c41e4b69ed7 “what do you mean?”
0x97bd80b7be02327b9bdc14908d51baacb4c0beec “well, i’ve just come from one and it’s the fifth night i’ve slept so....” he filled his glass, emptied it and paused.
0x375aa36e4fee2af3deafefb300ac2b3b7fc77acf bits of hay were in fact clinging to his clothes and sticking to his hair.
0x9b1bffd9922694c225141ca10abdb007842f87fd it seemed quite probable that he had not undressed or washed for the last five days.
0x1ec7c8c5625907dbbb99b2fc24c5fc0007842e4e his hands, particularly, were filthy.
0xf20225e3319165126a9eb36b2a2f61ce38233c53 they were fat and red, with black nails.
0x7c32fff54a93b3a734e3555ef991cdc6af405278 his conversation seemed to excite a general though languid interest.
0xaf16a99e020cc32647a4dbabe7413d098ef94a40 the boys at the counter fell to sniggering.
0x733806105c3d460093dc0822a7da5e2cc9d29108 the innkeeper came down from the upper room, apparently on purpose to listen to the “funny fellow” and sat down at a little distance, yawning lazily, but with dignity.
0x630797557e851e64110bf00e29ff5fe1a6681472 evidently marmeladov was a familiar figure here, and he had most likely acquired his weakness for high-flown speeches from the habit of frequently entering into conversation with strangers of all sorts in the tavern.
0xc8c8ef15fc2174ceb1a47f53e4667049c164c0d4 this habit develops into a necessity in some drunkards, and especially in those who are looked after sharply and kept in order at home.
0xef8a6aba104bc9cc86d8c88d686a689dff7b825f hence in the company of other drinkers they try to justify themselves and even if possible obtain consideration.
0xea784ffe871b4b0c5993fbb418f58252853e54de “funny fellow!”
0x00f20bdc90ac01d4dd2f9530e0187164dc947bc7 pronounced the innkeeper.
0xc9631f9889b93dc995884a3b3cfad5bbd5e2d74a “and why don’t you work, why aren’t you at your duty, if you are in the service?”
0x0e4551dbb7ec721cf52f4d1b0a888c3769944d0b “why am i not at my duty, honoured sir,” marmeladov went on, addressing himself exclusively to raskolnikov, as though it had been he who put that question to him.
0xf942344e16788c6df827e27c14269c1a7d709538 “why am i not at my duty?
0x9663e83a81f258d821bcb6917d33cf0c28c26ea1 does not my heart ache to think what a useless worm i am?

0x6f767cc886944e400fd8f9724e9669673673d7ee excuse me, young man, has it ever happened to you... hm... well, to petition hopelessly for a loan?”
0xa7b78772b55e010d5d4b4423c7bb0a6e0dc5d5b9 “yes, it has.
0x5afae59cdbc8b269a69dbd8d1ff7ca771f9a384c but what do you mean by hopelessly?”
0xb4210d99bd822ddfdb94977b03e33f57d09f249d “hopelessly in the fullest sense, when you know beforehand that you will get nothing by it.
0x7c192739e9bfd7cd7c7cac27806c9eff56e8fa97 you know, for instance, beforehand with positive certainty that this man, this most reputable and exemplary citizen, will on no consideration give you money; and indeed i ask you why should he?
0xfcddc7377494cb797dd58b4f24f3d1cde4a40b8a for he knows of course that i shan’t pay it back.

0x5afe0482917d3ac226e7f7651f38cb6f4a17320f but mr. lebeziatnikov who keeps up with modern ideas explained the other day that compassion is forbidden nowadays by science itself, and that that’s what is done now in england, where there is political economy.
0x5604afa63e7c4a241f5cbb153530cf4d4fab35fa why, i ask you, should he give it to me?
0xe66f8fb9421a5e9e92b0a3c64f44adefc2e2db0c and yet though i know beforehand that he won’t, i set off to him and...” “why do you go?”

0xa12b12ab5cbb5ecb2ea85b23e7e4ca4a7e8bc141 “well, when one has no one, nowhere else one can go!
0x5b07c5908b0a1f5d674e6192d9412edcc951fe51 for every man must have somewhere to go.
0x50d7ec6af412e1c968890cf2baaf0f168c482b5f since there are times when one absolutely must go somewhere!

0x0cfce5f4f7515e0c9e1bcc7b2d6b6ee3f61d3de1 “no matter, sir, no matter!”
0xdb04d388034f03b61660d79c1688ed8f8b1c6f59 he went on hurriedly and with apparent composure when both the boys at the counter guffawed and even the innkeeper smiled--“no matter, i am not confounded by the wagging of their heads; for everyone knows everything about it already, and all that is secret is made open.

0xeef8ce674bf108b819ed076661a16360325d097f ‘behold the man!’
0x75c00dd0296d1966cb5c67636021009c1e870ece excuse me, young man, can you.... no, to put it more strongly and more distinctly; not _can_ you but _dare_ you, looking upon me, assert that i am not a pig?”
0x11f40aef8eb504aa53ac520d7e20db0b800a83d8 the young man did not answer a word.
0xd5e213347c34c98a11b46e39e4ff594c1aa9c31c “well,” the orator began again stolidly and with even increased dignity, after waiting for the laughter in the room to subside.
0x87f92cb22388306694f957b1f87bfaf0fc436489 “well, so be it, i am a pig, but she is a lady!
0xcd1afc93168433c79bf0805f7bb446552f3c1191 i have the semblance of a beast, but katerina ivanovna, my spouse, is a person of education and an officer’s daughter.
0x83cad15d649674804864a84b3ab721affba5ea85 granted, granted, i am a scoundrel, but she is a woman of a noble heart, full of sentiments, refined by education.
0xbaffb9c766250b787ffac860771227d1a0213838 and yet... oh, if only she felt for me!
0x590cd851564d7f82fd121eb567ed6714443aa7e0 honoured sir, honoured sir, you know every man ought to have at least one place where people feel for him!
0xd1aeb206c0f216e6739e2010ff501d4897bb2230 but katerina ivanovna, though she is magnanimous, she is unjust.... and yet, although i realise that when she pulls my hair she only does it out of pity--for i repeat without being ashamed, she pulls my hair, young man,” he declared with redoubled dignity, hearing the sniggering again--“but, my god, if she would but once.... but no, no!
0xad69a55424b4d0787efc3fc3762f60df5ce60faf it’s all in vain and it’s no use talking!
0xbb676339b2e107d86a7cbf0cfdc238c3a9e4a2c5 no use talking!
0xfa7bea5b7b61b41069f8b171be3ba0d87d2c6b96 for more than once, my wish did come true and more than once she has felt for me but... such is my fate and i am a beast by nature!”
0x1cb4df721f20292d7660fab8b2a645f4bbb457b1 “rather!”
0x8ff7e9baac036c8f1f854869278c82cc0935ae27 assented the innkeeper yawning.
0xc3c00df20d30fddc961b58dc4a54b47a7e02d77e marmeladov struck his fist resolutely on the table.
0xdf27c8a5fadceaa303dd839d776f60a7f29f4a77 “such is my fate!
0xfe438ecdd41ce2bdb0b58a086cfc669fd48630f5 do you know, sir, do you know, i have sold her very stockings for drink?
0xa115ae0fec9b42b979b6f389a39f09a54851ef7f not her shoes--that would be more or less in the order of things, but her stockings, her stockings i have sold for drink!
0x46ceed83ce613f757133d8512ac5c8e185515852 her mohair shawl i sold for drink, a present to her long ago, her own property, not mine; and we live in a cold room and she caught cold this winter and has begun coughing and spitting blood too.
0xaa5a0317f75f305b5361f9fec4db1987557a3d26 we have three little children and katerina ivanovna is at work from morning till night; she is scrubbing and cleaning and washing the children, for she’s been used to cleanliness from a child.
0xc3889690dbd9e0fb9f2d95c5655952299e9e6168 but her chest is weak and she has a tendency to consumption and i feel it!
0x3adab29cd4b2d3d946e18261b6a04a6b6520f72f do you suppose i don’t feel it?
0xf3bb42ec267061de1098fa49d865c9833fa249b2 and the more i drink the more i feel it.
0x767587785c829c6e85183282889a4f580cca6a38 that’s why i drink too.
0x802915544b22f89a31f91d4d1b0613af1b088800 i try to find sympathy and feeling in drink.... i drink so that i may suffer twice as much!”
0x5ceaf2164c8dee16a868b492902664f2fabb97e9 and as though in despair he laid his head down on the table.
0x923746da1463f165b09c02173f562d19379e07e6 “young man,” he went on, raising his head again, “in your face i seem to read some trouble of mind.
0xdcb58d69af931c062dc0bc4faa753d9b33051210 when you came in i read it, and that was why i addressed you at once.
0xbd215aa220f362b948b3b1f50bf3ce3978d73524 for in unfolding to you the story of my life, i do not wish to make myself a laughing-stock before these idle listeners, who indeed know all about it already, but i am looking for a man of feeling and education.
0x8d48c118c590d3c2cf9a54fba6f18b571bfea7f2 know then that my wife was educated in a high-class school for the daughters of noblemen, and on leaving she danced the shawl dance before the governor and other personages for which she was presented with a gold medal and a certificate of merit.
0xf0c9114573b1eb72679074fa661e2e3037200526 the medal... well, the medal of course was sold--long ago, hm... but the certificate of merit is in her trunk still and not long ago she showed it to our landlady.
0x987dcb83de05be35e5451649f61789ad612e5c18 and although she is most continually on bad terms with the landlady, yet she wanted to tell someone or other of her past honours and of the happy days that are gone.
0xfed515c113dddce692bfa3b98d3edc09fe3c0e61 i don’t condemn her for it, i don’t blame her, for the one thing left her is recollection of the past, and all the rest is dust and ashes.
0x39940b1925a233afcf4088f78285e09e0bfa5c3c yes, yes, she is a lady of spirit, proud and determined.
0xdf3e43e62f19c6b28976bef609c2b7e837e4c0cd she scrubs the floors herself and has nothing but black bread to eat, but won’t allow herself to be treated with disrespect.
0xadf4597d6a149dce17a80e0f1cacc346d0f0f4fe that’s why she would not overlook mr. lebeziatnikov’s rudeness to her, and so when he gave her a beating for it, she took to her bed more from the hurt to her feelings than from the blows.
0xf0bb955e23acec61d665b2033cd737aadba26555 she was a widow when i married her, with three children, one smaller than the other.
0xe147a07db5e19312b300fc5bd3b3a44cd95df151 she married her first husband, an infantry officer, for love, and ran away with him from her father’s house.
0x64b59d30498646558bf206bf217ce4cbd2f62f54 she was exceedingly fond of her husband; but he gave way to cards, got into trouble and with that he died.
0x6dd4ecbca9337b2298028d44f9623c109809ae1a he used to beat her at the end: and although she paid him back, of which i have authentic documentary evidence, to this day she speaks of him with tears and she throws him up to me; and i am glad, i am glad that, though only in imagination, she should think of herself as having once been happy.... and she was left at his death with three children in a wild and remote district where i happened to be at the time; and she was left in such hopeless poverty that, although i have seen many ups and downs of all sort, i don’t feel equal to describing it even.
0xfdd247814a5b1386a30822a6b067b2f0ce9bda56 her relations had all thrown her off.
0x5dada0cd135877dbb15f53999270d2eea6a2538b and she was proud, too, excessively proud.... and then, honoured sir, and then, i, being at the time a widower, with a daughter of fourteen left me by my first wife, offered her my hand, for i could not bear the sight of such suffering.
0x39775158449a8616710e0371f60ad681dbc20e81 you can judge the extremity of her calamities, that she, a woman of education and culture and distinguished family, should have consented to be my wife.
0x1c742e66e87369f4556062644a1f5f09bf933c15 but she did!
0x8ce034838be1e788d2163bf182918ed346116d29 weeping and sobbing and wringing her hands, she married me!
0x0e11fbb04a8b5513054dc68aeaaac5efd9bb6089 for she had nowhere to turn!
0xfd05f66b5112dd3b021c8cd1a0fa8f97dd45a765 do you understand, sir, do you understand what it means when you have absolutely nowhere to turn?
0xd1bf03ce3fde07418e6ad661b238ded95eefc38b no, that you don’t understand yet.... and for a whole year, i performed my duties conscientiously and faithfully, and did not touch this” (he tapped the jug with his finger), “for i have feelings.
0xf70e60154b6b741091e9e748e6447276f42ae7f3 but even so, i could not please her; and then i lost my place too, and that through no fault of mine but through changes in the office; and then i did touch it!... it will be a year and a half ago soon since we found ourselves at last after many wanderings and numerous calamities in this magnificent capital, adorned with innumerable monuments.
0xeb05866693051e740ae805cf5d39fb44a04d629e here i obtained a situation.... i obtained it and i lost it again.
0x358ecff058614831827cca0c207c360691d81ab6 do you understand?
0x9eac7b5bec49663f7a6a282d19e7b72972af1e11 this time it was through my own fault i lost it: for my weakness had come out.... we have now part of a room at amalia fyodorovna lippevechsel’s; and what we live upon and what we pay our rent with, i could not say.
0xa37d7fb45c464c78b4ce140eafefff89a84ce70b there are a lot of people living there besides ourselves.
0x5efdc65c43bd9fe37df6f9847d1855631d7d8502 dirt and disorder, a perfect bedlam... hm... yes... and meanwhile my daughter by my first wife has grown up; and what my daughter has had to put up with from her step-mother whilst she was growing up, i won’t speak of.
0x4859e591c6213d03f194b5bba3728c4e121cc4de for, though katerina ivanovna is full of generous feelings, she is a spirited lady, irritable and short-tempered.... yes.
0x4a3a20c49393f28fa66e6653f9738af2c7800bab but it’s no use going over that!
0x54ada33a3dd0ec582d26399c382de4ebe0153bd9 sonia, as you may well fancy, has had no education.
0x8a5fab3ee8ed9a672b0a152399016d95ca8fd31c i did make an effort four years ago to give her a course of geography and universal history, but as i was not very well up in those subjects myself and we had no suitable books, and what books we had... hm, anyway we have not even those now, so all our instruction came to an end.
0xe4ca6efaa1fc55868db77aee7003c5e825f313d1 we stopped at cyrus of persia.
0xcb3bdc290a607ad52c6cc000ba98731ac454fe27 since she has attained years of maturity, she has read other books of romantic tendency and of late she had read with great interest a book she got through mr. lebeziatnikov, lewes’ physiology--do you know it?--and even recounted extracts from it to us: and that’s the whole of her education.
0x4343daa99c1413b471b4df0a57a38697494c5088 and now may i venture to address you, honoured sir, on my own account with a private question.
0x7c59d13eb1eb7de6d5a78d8f420f77af7b5aebca do you suppose that a respectable poor girl can earn much by honest work?
0x0336f3fc9562ad19b34471ce5b42d61c1e7e514e not fifteen farthings a day can she earn, if she is respectable and has no special talent and that without putting her work down for an instant!
0x207c056d9eae555ea693922cbdccfffaac09dd67 and what’s more, ivan ivanitch klopstock the civil counsellor--have you heard of him?--has not to this day paid her for the half-dozen linen shirts she made him and drove her roughly away, stamping and reviling her, on the pretext that the shirt collars were not made like the pattern and were put in askew.
0x63e77fad6bd44d0e07870d0784ea46c717751717 and there are the little ones hungry.... and katerina ivanovna walking up and down and wringing her hands, her cheeks flushed red, as they always are in that disease: ‘here you live with us,’ says she, ‘you eat and drink and are kept warm and you do nothing to help.’
0xfc94976027c85f964098689436bf183e7c82860a and much she gets to eat and drink when there is not a crust for the little ones for three days!
0x46de472f15c97ef167255cda46788b0b2c07d845 i was lying at the time... well, what of it!
0xd7eea30cc83535b42049c5c0a0bd3a261825eb81 i was lying drunk and i heard my sonia speaking (she is a gentle creature with a soft little voice... fair hair and such a pale, thin little face).
0x4e23e88961c1ec49d5cd940fe0a943d04c56d3be she said: ‘katerina ivanovna, am i really to do a thing like that?’
0x81013af3182e65db752fbe97bd119489874b67cd and darya frantsovna, a woman of evil character and very well known to the police, had two or three times tried to get at her through the landlady.
0x69259fe7739cc6fc2d67782cc2c98d943a10205f ‘and why not?’
0xb025b84538cd708fbacda89abc5dd214c261c358 said katerina ivanovna with a jeer, ‘you are something mighty precious to be so careful of!’
0xce7f32be2e78dcbed0cc475d39f2f2d73e6f0773 but don’t blame her, don’t blame her, honoured sir, don’t blame her!
0x2f4d827ffb89260163f1137fa10a714266138134 she was not herself when she spoke, but driven to distraction by her illness and the crying of the hungry children; and it was said more to wound her than anything else.... for that’s katerina ivanovna’s character, and when children cry, even from hunger, she falls to beating them at once.
0x12f3727ece97c4d2eb37c1a3d570daec12e878d4 at six o’clock i saw sonia get up, put on her kerchief and her cape, and go out of the room and about nine o’clock she came back.
0x637975db31d6b86f606ef5a22720dbae36383df2 she walked straight up to katerina ivanovna and she laid thirty roubles on the table before her in silence.
0xc31158e0b7eb15032e1d2c539dcebb1bb0e888a1 she did not utter a word, she did not even look at her, she simply picked up our big green _drap de dames_ shawl (we have a shawl, made of _drap de dames_), put it over her head and face and lay down on the bed with her face to the wall; only her little shoulders and her body kept shuddering.... and i went on lying there, just as before.... and then i saw, young man, i saw katerina ivanovna, in the same silence go up to sonia’s little bed; she was on her knees all the evening kissing sonia’s feet, and would not get up, and then they both fell asleep in each other’s arms... together, together... yes... and i... lay drunk.”
0x3199a75d50b42046fe6d475b1bcec59c50f1b0b4 marmeladov stopped short, as though his voice had failed him.
0xbf15bab6b579e03d81a4c3b6c921b5c9a8f0999d then he hurriedly filled his glass, drank, and cleared his throat.
0x5fa21f4670ca6d06d9f67e2137a656c6682fbc7d “since then, sir,” he went on after a brief pause--“since then, owing to an unfortunate occurrence and through information given by evil-intentioned persons--in all which darya frantsovna took a leading part on the pretext that she had been treated with want of respect--since then my daughter sofya semyonovna has been forced to take a yellow ticket, and owing to that she is unable to go on living with us.
0xa36aa77b29923644fe6cc66fb8f01464d1b640f7 for our landlady, amalia fyodorovna would not hear of it (though she had backed up darya frantsovna before) and mr. lebeziatnikov too... hm.... all the trouble between him and katerina ivanovna was on sonia’s account.
0xd9bddd5468916817e5e082a5e89ef36a78055416 at first he was for making up to sonia himself and then all of a sudden he stood on his dignity: ‘how,’ said he, ‘can a highly educated man like me live in the same rooms with a girl like that?’
0xfd2a84771a568d86213576e77b73b6360393ee17 and katerina ivanovna would not let it pass, she stood up for her... and so that’s how it happened.
0x9972bdb873c55d6f3463155c0cc8cb7a97ac38c0 and sonia comes to us now, mostly after dark; she comforts katerina ivanovna and gives her all she can.... she has a room at the kapernaumovs’ the tailors, she lodges with them; kapernaumov is a lame man with a cleft palate and all of his numerous family have cleft palates too.
0xc2a4ff06c7db7838b35bdafb244bf26e025cd11d and his wife, too, has a cleft palate.
0x11f89ae7d08f1ec9611371231e7dc74756e49269 they all live in one room, but sonia has her own, partitioned off.... hm... yes... very poor people and all with cleft palates... yes.
0x0e32ded21b5247fb5619ee93472cedfca6e713b1 then i got up in the morning, and put on my rags, lifted up my hands to heaven and set off to his excellency ivan afanasyvitch.
0x91b46d873d9293dae397d15e1c094d1fe28a7230 his excellency ivan afanasyvitch, do you know him?
0xab2a8af7ce473ffb31f04d122b44d7699a6e378f no?
0xe2179cec3479c050e9d21647dca3e72e3e57a843 well, then, it’s a man of god you don’t know.
0x25595cdd27b12fd7e8c39bc9acd419bc475240c0 he is wax... wax before the face of the lord; even as wax melteth!... his eyes were dim when he heard my story.
0x8c2f19e3f182fddc3eb9efad89b872737b11ec7f ‘marmeladov, once already you have deceived my expectations... i’ll take you once more on my own responsibility’--that’s what he said, ‘remember,’ he said, ‘and now you can go.’
0x8d43ad1614e1d728b84d162e77f3d6ef3db8d37e i kissed the dust at his feet--in thought only, for in reality he would not have allowed me to do it, being a statesman and a man of modern political and enlightened ideas.
0x3c0b40d8166765311415d974e8fd74f3d715c8f8 i returned home, and when i announced that i’d been taken back into the service and should receive a salary, heavens, what a to-do there was!...”
0x35d47798b3f3a9cf4178e9e77af47bee6747c9f4 marmeladov stopped again in violent excitement.
0xb3eb962a541eb537a24b4bcc40d848c045c4fcfa at that moment a whole party of revellers already drunk came in from the street, and the sounds of a hired concertina and the cracked piping voice of a child of seven singing “the hamlet” were heard in the entry.
0x110ecea8bde672fc4cb88dc4b4b7a795b40dbd54 the room was filled with noise.
0xc7e2c163f575d5e0a317ca5c59cb32e4ba9c86c5 the tavern-keeper and the boys were busy with the new-comers.
0x89424d8bf67bab3eb02a1711c6fc15c22a05749c marmeladov paying no attention to the new arrivals continued his story.
0x5a68d687fd4ef8f3bc59c71fc00e9c5aa7897253 he appeared by now to be extremely weak, but as he became more and more drunk, he became more and more talkative.
0x1fa4329d6ea47d595e5b04ad8c4c7b18fdb1bd68 the recollection of his recent success in getting the situation seemed to revive him, and was positively reflected in a sort of radiance on his face.
0xf8c29c4ea6bdc3026a6a676d001dc0f658c7f8b4 raskolnikov listened attentively.
0x04eb24bc5b1855f777ad2669e371cc33ab036fee “that was five weeks ago, sir.
0xe260842c512cec86f3087bc83e3ec84c26d5f846 yes.... as soon as katerina ivanovna and sonia heard of it, mercy on us, it was as though i stepped into the kingdom of heaven.
0x05155b7ae298a2a4b7de9a7b1ddf84b4e0c3f3c7 it used to be: you can lie like a beast, nothing but abuse.
0x2a49573f6cf49695b820e2ba77e09781760e9a15 now they were walking on tiptoe, hushing the children.
0xa98d2c9f95589f229cd10105e8ac52ee69b7ccf4 ‘semyon zaharovitch is tired with his work at the office, he is resting, shh!’
0xc6a1e70531f4b68ff51beef4df5c75da19bed554 they made me coffee before i went to work and boiled cream for me!
0x08fe16eda725f050333a28d7f88ea06c5477f307 they began to get real cream for me, do you hear that?
0xee3dba2581432c55abcf7680c6ce6a607d9562c4 and how they managed to get together the money for a decent outfit--eleven roubles, fifty copecks, i can’t guess.
0xab51d8c95c0ba89127bf557414dd52f28c4d3f7d boots, cotton shirt-fronts--most magnificent, a uniform, they got up all in splendid style, for eleven roubles and a half.
0x68d546f206084ebf4843a174d4dd34cebe3f9bfa the first morning i came back from the office i found katerina ivanovna had cooked two courses for dinner--soup and salt meat with horse radish--which we had never dreamed of till then.
0x153981714fe3bdbafe4bba9d08fa1ccc232a30b3 she had not any dresses... none at all, but she got herself up as though she were going on a visit; and not that she’d anything to do it with, she smartened herself up with nothing at all, she’d done her hair nicely, put on a clean collar of some sort, cuffs, and there she was, quite a different person, she was younger and better looking.
0x5e546909b520017df746681a54f524f39f737569 sonia, my little darling, had only helped with money ‘for the time,’ she said, ‘it won’t do for me to come and see you too often.

0x99b15bc001ccea891b93bc7e4258d6434bdfc34e i lay down for a nap after dinner and what do you think: though katerina ivanovna had quarrelled to the last degree with our landlady amalia fyodorovna only a week before, she could not resist then asking her in to coffee.
0x609e802f73b029af9416087c6c5aa8e994fe90d8 for two hours they were sitting, whispering together.
0x5093173f0d07285a1780a4e7fa28be01575b24c2 ‘semyon zaharovitch is in the service again, now, and receiving a salary,’ says she, ‘and he went himself to his excellency and his excellency himself came out to him, made all the others wait and led semyon zaharovitch by the hand before everybody into his study.’
0xccf98f852f978e219ad1c6fd56822cf3527cf67b do you hear, do you hear?
0x00f2b4eea55f19a5bf5bd3bb79468de1d70f233e ‘to be sure,’ says he, ‘semyon zaharovitch, remembering your past services,’ says he, ‘and in spite of your propensity to that foolish weakness, since you promise now and since moreover we’ve got on badly without you,’ (do you hear, do you hear;) ‘and so,’ says he, ‘i rely now on your word as a gentleman.’
0x1a8ae431f4947aa30e028b8d5bdcf9d3c1972c1c and all that, let me tell you, she has simply made up for herself, and not simply out of wantonness, for the sake of bragging; no, she believes it all herself, she amuses herself with her own fancies, upon my word she does!
0xf0f9953d928d58155af821ad0eadff719cb9df92 and i don’t blame her for it, no, i don’t blame her!... six days ago when i brought her my first earnings in full--twenty-three roubles forty copecks altogether--she called me her poppet: ‘poppet,’ said she, ‘my little poppet.’
0x242e3cbc923c0888bc0f608f3dff3ba5a95a200c and when we were by ourselves, you understand?
0xffa56da96163d5aabd7f9b8cc366410e90bf918d you would not think me a beauty, you would not think much of me as a husband, would you?... well, she pinched my cheek, ‘my little poppet,’ said she.”
0xc0d6b056d0c5119f75a00761e94fc647898eb2f8 marmeladov broke off, tried to smile, but suddenly his chin began to twitch.
0xe9c217174b8079de46d0595b03df928fd60ac9e2 he controlled himself however.
0x59fe818d0cc5a2a08de69e819f74aea04614f4ea the tavern, the degraded appearance of the man, the five nights in the hay barge, and the pot of spirits, and yet this poignant love for his wife and children bewildered his listener.
0x4fcba559754c38201934998cb4d36f309c0e67a8 raskolnikov listened intently but with a sick sensation.
0x83ac2be73ecc025e9346934715a9a012893e22e8 he felt vexed that he had come here.
0x4f596101d5a0c76cbaf2d814e0ab55f11c784a47 “honoured sir, honoured sir,” cried marmeladov recovering himself--“oh, sir, perhaps all this seems a laughing matter to you, as it does to others, and perhaps i am only worrying you with the stupidity of all the trivial details of my home life, but it is not a laughing matter to me.
0x5c14caa4b38bf4647763d38eeb2d4f6e6bce7d3a for i can feel it all.... and the whole of that heavenly day of my life and the whole of that evening i passed in fleeting dreams of how i would arrange it all, and how i would dress all the children, and how i should give her rest, and how i should rescue my own daughter from dishonour and restore her to the bosom of her family.... and a great deal more.... quite excusable, sir.
0xc1515bc6cce12dbbdd47b6d810a99cf73a9ab817 well, then, sir” (marmeladov suddenly gave a sort of start, raised his head and gazed intently at his listener) “well, on the very next day after all those dreams, that is to say, exactly five days ago, in the evening, by a cunning trick, like a thief in the night, i stole from katerina ivanovna the key of her box, took out what was left of my earnings, how much it was i have forgotten, and now look at me, all of you!
0x246b8031eb0730d5d65eee38fbd425c51db55c1b it’s the fifth day since i left home, and they are looking for me there and it’s the end of my employment, and my uniform is lying in a tavern on the egyptian bridge.
0x63701ed103eb545814467da3e4a7cc6f9f90ddd9 i exchanged it for the garments i have on... and it’s the end of everything!”
0xdbdf7b135eeb25cad4b8b7a4065a1f8bb1c764a5 marmeladov struck his forehead with his fist, clenched his teeth, closed his eyes and leaned heavily with his elbow on the table.
0x0c5b1d9b3d3cacf96f829d110128128afceeb9f7 but a minute later his face suddenly changed and with a certain assumed slyness and affectation of bravado, he glanced at raskolnikov, laughed and said: “this morning i went to see sonia, i went to ask her for a pick-me-up!
0x5bf862ef8d666b48c72bb420176633c9cd4aa56f he-he-he!”
0xb94265b51ec10c7347345feeca6bc70a5080a1a9 “you don’t say she gave it to you?”
0x4517895db27a16291fad7509586275842c50df66 cried one of the new-comers; he shouted the words and went off into a guffaw.
0x79b47621a5d8f6ea8c086821c6a667d58a6de7e7 “this very quart was bought with her money,” marmeladov declared, addressing himself exclusively to raskolnikov.
0x14ae8be2a2d74897fa7ab1a64bcdfdae7a498a22 “thirty copecks she gave me with her own hands, her last, all she had, as i saw.... she said nothing, she only looked at me without a word.... not on earth, but up yonder... they grieve over men, they weep, but they don’t blame them, they don’t blame them!
0x67747aa42a81cc12f88383ab7fa58920faba13b0 but it hurts more, it hurts more when they don’t blame!
0xc508b85e934e306014d67ca6afba6f0ccf914e93 thirty copecks yes!
0x5d100618d14e7a0f047f13c1a76b5d7a3cf62b7a and maybe she needs them now, eh?
0x6a45c21fb78ce077a44c86e075b21aff927eae9a what do you think, my dear sir?
0xb72ee9449a6357f0287e395865e0c06cbca8e21a for now she’s got to keep up her appearance.
0x3bcaaf12055d764cfb1c811feeced4e0f95ac8ee it costs money, that smartness, that special smartness, you know?
0x358ecff058614831827cca0c207c360691d81ab6 do you understand?
0x0a35527bc1436362e9c1863295005d601f2b4265 and there’s pomatum, too, you see, she must have things; petticoats, starched ones, shoes, too, real jaunty ones to show off her foot when she has to step over a puddle.
0x30cf1de882af2167b8e71e03fe73a8fd75e42293 do you understand, sir, do you understand what all that smartness means?
0xe3d55a21dde35cb8a2b8791b1101a486447c38f5 and here i, her own father, here i took thirty copecks of that money for a drink!

0xfcd98549842c4519f176cc3c715176fe076e70e1 are you sorry for me, sir, or not?
0xf37b568a4462f48602b0e53a1acf203a473bf428 tell me, sir, are you sorry or not?
0x5bf862ef8d666b48c72bb420176633c9cd4aa56f he-he-he!”
0x94221b04abd0203c6c3fda4b32d992bd11581e1a he would have filled his glass, but there was no drink left.
0x1fba7c42ec0861fd3c01e46c9a0285658cfab6d7 the pot was empty.
0x905ba5feba1f4a9a9cd8378171a1c43e4d7f285a “what are you to be pitied for?”
0x85874239a513974e8b98a5e6e7908a4e5213fe5f shouted the tavern-keeper who was again near them.
0x2dd14cd0ffe5c8570e4d7f2ceb010d5ea1445b8c shouts of laughter and even oaths followed.
0x20a8a21259395d3f91152a8714922b3d12115cd4 the laughter and the oaths came from those who were listening and also from those who had heard nothing but were simply looking at the figure of the discharged government clerk.
0xfb3f6d08f3746eee8e06120dc762bd5680e59cba “to be pitied!
0xbde07e4e5d96dea089da2723fc9327b91d2589f4 why am i to be pitied?”
0xdd664f01939d8a1a42ddedad8796b4b42dfc589d marmeladov suddenly declaimed, standing up with his arm outstretched, as though he had been only waiting for that question.
0x6ada4c6c3623349186ef46b8461f75dcbc1f3608 “why am i to be pitied, you say?
0x8a1519af533ba47d6b2b2e4ec1b7d06c616b9d50 yes!
0x02efd50c2e453721c355667a61db91cc2a9fda4a there’s nothing to pity me for!
0x340fb9127ca52bd80333ed163a0875cadbc1a59f i ought to be crucified, crucified on a cross, not pitied!
0x38f69b6f02e8d55c4f3a9a9f95acf5f21a17a622 crucify me, oh judge, crucify me but pity me!
0xd26f37ea3f307c98ddc517c77d967eda5bbc49be and then i will go of myself to be crucified, for it’s not merry-making i seek but tears and tribulation!... do you suppose, you that sell, that this pint of yours has been sweet to me?
0x9826e683d63598a3397b8198e805bb09a982f177 it was tribulation i sought at the bottom of it, tears and tribulation, and have found it, and i have tasted it; but he will pity us who has had pity on all men, who has understood all men and all things, he is the one, he too is the judge.
0xfe922463bf95d4d4b3ba8bc4aa905bfa0485a530 he will come in that day and he will ask: ‘where is the daughter who gave herself for her cross, consumptive step-mother and for the little children of another?
0x6e9c7516ecddc93a0d61e69a4641302f57bffe99 where is the daughter who had pity upon the filthy drunkard, her earthly father, undismayed by his beastliness?’
0x9c3c50f68844c8927db3a64e794486eff1d27b41 and he will say, ‘come to me!
0xd15e4a3a166c48675defeaa7dc05b3b6a3572a24 i have already forgiven thee once.... i have forgiven thee once.... thy sins which are many are forgiven thee for thou hast loved much....’ and he will forgive my sonia, he will forgive, i know it... i felt it in my heart when i was with her just now!
0xc5e9662da0853ed96f4e4b410d231bb401cf8e4d and he will judge and will forgive all, the good and the evil, the wise and the meek.... and when he has done with all of them, then he will summon us.
0xbafd560c3dacb421a5055600ca07cafe1645f79f ‘you too come forth,’ he will say, ‘come forth ye drunkards, come forth, ye weak ones, come forth, ye children of shame!’
0x6f4b6e937ee05deef6efbe28c323bd86a6dede27 and we shall all come forth, without shame and shall stand before him.
0x2cc067fbb392437ff712e4b023f0e1fb924e12ba and he will say unto us, ‘ye are swine, made in the image of the beast and with his mark; but come ye also!’
0xac6ea2e9adda63c82a5c9ef000a4c235204065b6 and the wise ones and those of understanding will say, ‘oh lord, why dost thou receive these men?’
0x9acce4f6787e0d8a3ff445a14602d3857f43c986 and he will say, ‘this is why i receive them, oh ye wise, this is why i receive them, oh ye of understanding, that not one of them believed himself to be worthy of this.’
0x7a0c323073ba21a9bf9cef7bd8820944b92f0abd and he will hold out his hands to us and we shall fall down before him... and we shall weep... and we shall understand all things!
0x4ff93b7581c039ddaa1677c210c8d8daab2e1789 then we shall understand all!... and all will understand, katerina ivanovna even... she will understand.... lord, thy kingdom come!”
0x49927cba180e99069bb72a26e922629bcdfe1609 and he sank down on the bench exhausted, and helpless, looking at no one, apparently oblivious of his surroundings and plunged in deep thought.
0x5fc4f86b1abf6e1a640f4fd516028e4aacce59d3 his words had created a certain impression; there was a moment of silence; but soon laughter and oaths were heard again.
0x9058376c9d96af4344c3f75cb2dbde2c6f9d3be7 “that’s his notion!”
0x9c7c3f90eda4833958a3c779454ae6876927f833 “talked himself silly!”
0x2267f770b795007ce4894f6a826d81fe5437e8bb “a fine clerk he is!”
0x876fb773756cdf82d8f28961e6abfe7f1005bb63 and so on, and so on.
0x42399a8bdeb2e7bda7034869cfa9b17e6f71cfbb “let us go, sir,” said marmeladov all at once, raising his head and addressing raskolnikov--“come along with me... kozel’s house, looking into the yard.
0x0aad7d2d187c41370f1b2de8fc8f80e6d79aba41 i’m going to katerina ivanovna--time i did.”
0x855d3d45cbdf69c37e27795c9a2874de5a21f4b5 raskolnikov had for some time been wanting to go and he had meant to help him.
0x850454283365db10e7fc6a7ad859215383bec1ad marmeladov was much unsteadier on his legs than in his speech and leaned heavily on the young man.
0x678a6e88e317ad7b53f833f47252cd721d3c93df they had two or three hundred paces to go.
0x800b813cd901422fbe409d87832ad069b1657104 the drunken man was more and more overcome by dismay and confusion as they drew nearer the house.
0x593abe3fe22a658db6695c6c5bbc9b75445a19b6 “it’s not katerina ivanovna i am afraid of now,” he muttered in agitation--“and that she will begin pulling my hair.
0x879a4227c45b1e8249263537c7c2e34beb11bbd0 what does my hair matter!
0x9cc5ee827f0521db56bcf32716189082cd7a78ca bother my hair!
0x8c8c07bd8139c5b10c5daf452d4b14831af3d857 that’s what i say!
0x173ca481f707100d002d8abaaa5432c7baa0124c indeed it will be better if she does begin pulling it, that’s not what i am afraid of... it’s her eyes i am afraid of... yes, her eyes... the red on her cheeks, too, frightens me... and her breathing too.... have you noticed how people in that disease breathe... when they are excited?
0x9378eaae8129d460b1177c52aa4f63f0e564f996 i am frightened of the children’s crying, too.... for if sonia has not taken them food... i don’t know what’s happened!
0x70db32a304c209af6ab3239da371b4f605f3b1be i don’t know!
0x46132cf762ee20cb9bdd8d6a8998c0fb1e9d8542 but blows i am not afraid of.... know, sir, that such blows are not a pain to me, but even an enjoyment.
0x2a8a4ce8371ba700bfe385b21d682f99aede7bf3 in fact i can’t get on without it.... it’s better so.
0xa956b3aa234c5d089a59c358741cbfc6de7ad7e7 let her strike me, it relieves her heart... it’s better so... there is the house.
0xa42f2ab995d055585ac3d7b6c148e0209bd6c39c the house of kozel, the cabinet-maker... a german, well-to-do.
0x9ad89601ad42890b0b07d59fe8a8fe57ff76f2e1 lead the way!”
0xe33be38c5494fd4d9845d848df9db2b628f8c912 they went in from the yard and up to the fourth storey.
0xd247942ce49aaaf60b64914cab5030e81360f067 the staircase got darker and darker as they went up.
0x6bd66544e3930540e6ea673cb5603900b0e0cfbf it was nearly eleven o’clock and although in summer in petersburg there is no real night, yet it was quite dark at the top of the stairs.
0xe6af16da7d7ada921a574a8544d0591d980a98c6 a grimy little door at the very top of the stairs stood ajar.
0x84cc939b5cdded64ba4f7ed1243aa6873ee4c5f7 a very poor-looking room about ten paces long was lighted up by a candle-end; the whole of it was visible from the entrance.
0x70ccc4eb964905e25a3084c550193199b19d36dc it was all in disorder, littered up with rags of all sorts, especially children’s garments.
0x1470afa1a3ec456bb0bd1ca69b6f88118396664f across the furthest corner was stretched a ragged sheet.
0xb8460ded86a015eb5e5641c0f4e3bd5569b16153 behind it probably was the bed.
0xa559e81e3ccf0a22fd96eae2c686ae37d8bca4cf there was nothing in the room except two chairs and a sofa covered with american leather, full of holes, before which stood an old deal kitchen-table, unpainted and uncovered.
0xb02df867b53caa28d50bb689adfef98e19fb44b6 at the edge of the table stood a smoldering tallow-candle in an iron candlestick.
0x5a418c055ee3277679e30dbba624417b7fcfe1b5 it appeared that the family had a room to themselves, not part of a room, but their room was practically a passage.
0xf9cd054bd4c6dcd2495d13df98716af2d0814ee9 the door leading to the other rooms, or rather cupboards, into which amalia lippevechsel’s flat was divided stood half open, and there was shouting, uproar and laughter within.
0x0c7679c33511b0162dcfabd5d91e3ab694d8edc5 people seemed to be playing cards and drinking tea there.
0x9831326bd11ddf4cd9ad1253899f8c28c7bb6fc9 words of the most unceremonious kind flew out from time to time.
0x836563a8b8544dbe655803f657f0d4831d21c32b raskolnikov recognised katerina ivanovna at once.
0x357cc9a936e2cd47d9763b8b807547a0316d1bf5 she was a rather tall, slim and graceful woman, terribly emaciated, with magnificent dark brown hair and with a hectic flush in her cheeks.
0xe6229fbb32a4665f8f96d4712af07b5800b4da74 she was pacing up and down in her little room, pressing her hands against her chest; her lips were parched and her breathing came in nervous broken gasps.
0xb81defcdbae847dda9b2e5348e8ce56a8f67a596 her eyes glittered as in fever and looked about with a harsh immovable stare.
0xd10ebf42be3f0e2c2456e27a95f705c4afefcef0 and that consumptive and excited face with the last flickering light of the candle-end playing upon it made a sickening impression.
0xf059c5af269b77c2d8d57e5039ff33f29698ddab she seemed to raskolnikov about thirty years old and was certainly a strange wife for marmeladov.... she had not heard them and did not notice them coming in.
0xa61b147ab923a83e284d3a8443f45d7980dda35d she seemed to be lost in thought, hearing and seeing nothing.
0x1a3a9ad5e94f6069717da8f08e549715fc411e1f the room was close, but she had not opened the window; a stench rose from the staircase, but the door on to the stairs was not closed.
0xdad7a536368839bc62d60f94e149d5dc69e93e1d from the inner rooms clouds of tobacco smoke floated in, she kept coughing, but did not close the door.
0xdcd3cf15f8861653385cff83e060c6d0843b6579 the youngest child, a girl of six, was asleep, sitting curled up on the floor with her head on the sofa.
0x0866e2c49087368c8fe84bcb6f5e843ef699dcb7 a boy a year older stood crying and shaking in the corner, probably he had just had a beating.
0x353b0bd33e135411d01173deb04a96a40141d92a beside him stood a girl of nine years old, tall and thin, wearing a thin and ragged chemise with an ancient cashmere pelisse flung over her bare shoulders, long outgrown and barely reaching her knees.
0x9d324c2a2617200f4acc4d67b3fbc5e1986a36de her arm, as thin as a stick, was round her brother’s neck.
0xe1f7d0ce1ea64f2425d10633306a149100ede41c she was trying to comfort him, whispering something to him, and doing all she could to keep him from whimpering again.
0x5ccb454fb90149d1d962da462666a104d851cad5 at the same time her large dark eyes, which looked larger still from the thinness of her frightened face, were watching her mother with alarm.
0xb7b64df039969d6e8f4758e79ff3efb8fccdadd5 marmeladov did not enter the door, but dropped on his knees in the very doorway, pushing raskolnikov in front of him.
0xa529793480f99f722f91192f3bf1d72385cc2803 the woman seeing a stranger stopped indifferently facing him, coming to herself for a moment and apparently wondering what he had come for.
0x1a4afe1d54116b07004198cdac48fcc98bba299d but evidently she decided that he was going into the next room, as he had to pass through hers to get there.
0x8680489fde40d703847673a7a11da3f3a655aa46 taking no further notice of him, she walked towards the outer door to close it and uttered a sudden scream on seeing her husband on his knees in the doorway.
0xdb1738134f718d1543cc5a7cae67ac6ca0b1cd13 “ah!”
0x389e2377efdb790a66a9687380241b56a84f4f47 she cried out in a frenzy, “he has come back!
0xfeb2e3bb5d50584c45a1074d0669fca3c8db6813 the criminal!
0x4912b7d1540e91170c8751060d91b0b1ff932944 the monster!... and where is the money?

0x59c18366b4a8a456c6362bb763d7dc37056f3ffd and she fell to searching him.
0x41bf2beecebea63aee2035d411547336fba231bf marmeladov submissively and obediently held up both arms to facilitate the search.
0xd665c5648947cdbb74f1a65108df8640a9978729 not a farthing was there.
0xd48e5b71faed02e2e1f3a7e1559f0f359de5ea7d “where is the money?”
0x4bc78dc6d35f8d27fa8f7d2911bc8d0960f3b117 she cried--“mercy on us, can he have drunk it all?
0xe23d1fb0e35374311ad0fb228506dc1429b860f6 there were twelve silver roubles left in the chest!”
0xf9b2d7a2721a732076704be69d9503f015ffefd9 and in a fury she seized him by the hair and dragged him into the room.
0xe835eb151fb6ba04a0434ccfda82d62609733fd2 marmeladov seconded her efforts by meekly crawling along on his knees.
0xe8f5e484b05ccc23478338c9ee48a975b886a9de “and this is a consolation to me!
0xe100b57ea9347b43099f3e208215f4b44d91576e this does not hurt me, but is a positive con-so-la-tion, ho-nou-red sir,” he called out, shaken to and fro by his hair and even once striking the ground with his forehead.
0x699de23643a52f70a94581d9e62705ebfd7dd0f6 the child asleep on the floor woke up, and began to cry.
0x8dcdaa1610f0f8ac6f776730ca5bb57008732b7e the boy in the corner losing all control began trembling and screaming and rushed to his sister in violent terror, almost in a fit.
0x608c1eaaa72ec1b071e80c209451392481ad7728 the eldest girl was shaking like a leaf.
0x0e25c5bf137a9f0cea00466d81b2732af936fb98 “he’s drunk it!
0x2f0ae8d6b215697c4387d332f30ca70956edf963 he’s drunk it all,” the poor woman screamed in despair--“and his clothes are gone!
0x0a69cc89ab64df52aaed81fe6e1bd1d953aa8350 and they are hungry, hungry!”--and wringing her hands she pointed to the children.
0x8353e7de92b29c464858315a7d554eb2c6c3076c “oh, accursed life!
0x90f2e066204036f504e2e682fa8ff4385f007d67 and you, are you not ashamed?”--she pounced all at once upon raskolnikov--“from the tavern!
0xeee5731ecb93c60826740e29d121fb3d843aa81f have you been drinking with him?
0x75c7732b967f7b5879b1cfa0155527f688f6583d you have been drinking with him, too!
0x968c08aa527143d7de6f9b0ffaf2d2e969f65389 go away!”
0x8aa118c73d718eba417185f9325951011b345dec the young man was hastening away without uttering a word.
0xff0cf44273b0b95a73e23d5e3ba3f66e6c0e9bd0 the inner door was thrown wide open and inquisitive faces were peering in at it.
0xe527fa9df6773096f294a492e5670d896eb564dd coarse laughing faces with pipes and cigarettes and heads wearing caps thrust themselves in at the doorway.
0x6f64d33cb33460878c4f79cd0b6d39471af656fc further in could be seen figures in dressing gowns flung open, in costumes of unseemly scantiness, some of them with cards in their hands.
0x75a60854cfb324dd4d9e5043d8d784a9c344e1cf they were particularly diverted, when marmeladov, dragged about by his hair, shouted that it was a consolation to him.
0x938f68c266bd42e9cc34d44778463846f6ea4146 they even began to come into the room; at last a sinister shrill outcry was heard: this came from amalia lippevechsel herself pushing her way amongst them and trying to restore order after her own fashion and for the hundredth time to frighten the poor woman by ordering her with coarse abuse to clear out of the room next day.
0x2ece1ea9c4c7029a9f655b4d604b30239c9762c0 as he went out, raskolnikov had time to put his hand into his pocket, to snatch up the coppers he had received in exchange for his rouble in the tavern and to lay them unnoticed on the window.
0xe77013d2eeab9fd127ccc1309bacc8b2d14a3e8c afterwards on the stairs, he changed his mind and would have gone back.
0xb8105e7adacacfbdb71f12d5ad50625bfc822271 “what a stupid thing i’ve done,” he thought to himself, “they have sonia and i want it myself.”
0xfc405495f9d7c3823c9a96c03bf51b24102e255d but reflecting that it would be impossible to take it back now and that in any case he would not have taken it, he dismissed it with a wave of his hand and went back to his lodging.
0xd59d5b0a0cc315a4b792cf02bf0b42c691fedca7 “sonia wants pomatum too,” he said as he walked along the street, and he laughed malignantly--“such smartness costs money.... hm!
0xaf7ab9866de1687c1bd92d48f13eb53b5bc615c8 and maybe sonia herself will be bankrupt to-day, for there is always a risk, hunting big game... digging for gold... then they would all be without a crust to-morrow except for my money.
0x349eaf9cba946dd5b925df7801570fd166c85e6a hurrah for sonia!
0x0aa8c880d2396fb9044e1e8d3d8b3cb5895b721f what a mine they’ve dug there!
0x35c0229366995521f1f5ea9aa4311cb6edab0c05 and they’re making the most of it!
0xc1152202175f1075922b47a488458389d494c67c yes, they are making the most of it!
0xe86d619b46ab40545d6daad4f3b1122e52efba54 they’ve wept over it and grown used to it.
0xee6d575bf67f8b23ddd3a898a421e032e9e362c8 man grows used to everything, the scoundrel!”
0x6832c8e2a70e3c98564804fc28078061df23dfbc he sank into thought.
0xe567ff1f1275104573b7f8bd308c0bae06db97a1 “and what if i am wrong,” he cried suddenly after a moment’s thought.
0x94667b9e1dcaac5b8342c0b9f9cb9c5e2725ba79 “what if man is not really a scoundrel, man in general, i mean, the whole race of mankind--then all the rest is prejudice, simply artificial terrors and there are no barriers and it’s all as it should be.”
0x4ae7a74877b72417e12746254f35085b1feb814f chapter iii he waked up late next day after a broken sleep.
0x6a7a928eee5507fee1b6aa610e1f272373c10e2d but his sleep had not refreshed him; he waked up bilious, irritable, ill-tempered, and looked with hatred at his room.
0x2e13d4f4fa9cdf7bcac8fc36103c749867da6b78 it was a tiny cupboard of a room about six paces in length.
0x1897f73e4453936c3da93baf69e1d87db31dff16 it had a poverty-stricken appearance with its dusty yellow paper peeling off the walls, and it was so low-pitched that a man of more than average height was ill at ease in it and felt every moment that he would knock his head against the ceiling.
0x486090a5bc95b434ce9fc10e9a8265e5822a11e0 the furniture was in keeping with the room: there were three old chairs, rather rickety; a painted table in the corner on which lay a few manuscripts and books; the dust that lay thick upon them showed that they had been long untouched.
0xb55da3c271752b638587ecb83fb35ed6019d2f57 a big clumsy sofa occupied almost the whole of one wall and half the floor space of the room; it was once covered with chintz, but was now in rags and served raskolnikov as a bed.
0xe7942acc16ab30c96390f13618846c340c16db20 often he went to sleep on it, as he was, without undressing, without sheets, wrapped in his old student’s overcoat, with his head on one little pillow, under which he heaped up all the linen he had, clean and dirty, by way of a bolster.
0xbb8262b2e3d98dfcd397349297f4beab3c43ff74 a little table stood in front of the sofa.
0x23014c9447877afed13dcbd515ebc2c859ae3e42 it would have been difficult to sink to a lower ebb of disorder, but to raskolnikov in his present state of mind this was positively agreeable.
0xfc29a89aebbca0404e3b9727b3cf33f3790588f0 he had got completely away from everyone, like a tortoise in its shell, and even the sight of a servant girl who had to wait upon him and looked sometimes into his room made him writhe with nervous irritation.
0x37147e413abd05a3837bcb19042f68ad263a615b he was in the condition that overtakes some monomaniacs entirely concentrated upon one thing.
0x34f3cda44d29944c32b78b9a1151c2718b9bd6e9 his landlady had for the last fortnight given up sending him in meals, and he had not yet thought of expostulating with her, though he went without his dinner.
0x4d37279b31dab57e2ffbb7d6007c60b368de30ff nastasya, the cook and only servant, was rather pleased at the lodger’s mood and had entirely given up sweeping and doing his room, only once a week or so she would stray into his room with a broom.
0x587247b30d3445a6ad94cc4af57a0de6a171d7cc she waked him up that day.
0xd43021d0154084ffbb2111516dc39b9d717bcd04 “get up, why are you asleep?”
0x654738b352862401923c0fa1e1d5f43bdddeecd6 she called to him.
0x87e25caa1292e62c62c2089f92fced994b6368fb “it’s past nine, i have brought you some tea; will you have a cup?
0x4a1d0420cf2e466bdb2058de160bf3c0cc712a5f i should think you’re fairly starving?”
0x91d8fe970d16b3143afa1e1fc62c18ec180b8746 raskolnikov opened his eyes, started and recognised nastasya.
0xe560d64c2007ee0433c74ec4cfbb089f5d80c5df “from the landlady, eh?”
0x9ffe7a0e8fa1d0f80f490058d43ef593d0012ab5 he asked, slowly and with a sickly face sitting up on the sofa.
0xd80461ea3ddb2b0f422d365cb4bf5c17f485a87f “from the landlady, indeed!”
0x152fafe5324800b3f3ba7eac0d25e315d891f4f2 she set before him her own cracked teapot full of weak and stale tea and laid two yellow lumps of sugar by the side of it.
0x290982ed70d3333dfea9c69e698704c1f3af1ce9 “here, nastasya, take it please,” he said, fumbling in his pocket (for he had slept in his clothes) and taking out a handful of coppers--“run and buy me a loaf.
0x8279c0bdc75e18385131f2f9a64597ed037e802c and get me a little sausage, the cheapest, at the pork-butcher’s.”
0x28d5c87a37c2d43fe027fff995d61bca5f982e13 “the loaf i’ll fetch you this very minute, but wouldn’t you rather have some cabbage soup instead of sausage?
0x460d8ca56304d9dc59104909002996b40ccbab71 it’s capital soup, yesterday’s.
0x417ea565fa3049845f30aa054e35cfb0752ed2cf i saved it for you yesterday, but you came in late.
0x8b9d08a3bfaf95a9b7cfe51ac8383c4c1503283a it’s fine soup.”
0x6ba82e9bcfcdbfa2265191b83c544e44dedc1c5c when the soup had been brought, and he had begun upon it, nastasya sat down beside him on the sofa and began chatting.
0xb88f150fda42a116f680db214ef5860ed537478f she was a country peasant-woman and a very talkative one.
0x72d12ea734a24d52c9d9c4e1da5a61477d7c2d83 “praskovya pavlovna means to complain to the police about you,” she said.
0x5d3d682fc6a850b15357d2ac3b0982d81385bcb0 he scowled.
0xce5d4fcc7530080cac811817d547fa91a51926fb “to the police?
0xc3e02a26a169b5a17810c0a828c0e9a2ca22b320 what does she want?”
0x34b71abb0fab7bdbe9bc673b3119aacbcfe1c646 “you don’t pay her money and you won’t turn out of the room.
0xcbfee6442c44b180fde35ab320cf35ad1cca823a that’s what she wants, to be sure.”
0x76ea2ebc3058fec4966b01c15c47e111ca6062fc “the devil, that’s the last straw,” he muttered, grinding his teeth, “no, that would not suit me... just now.
0x3502a9af08be72f2fa15834a75e1051237fec703 she is a fool,” he added aloud.
0x557606dd028747964d9e0b566d7ffac6f6604aef “i’ll go and talk to her to-day.”
0xb2bbfc57ded9c882fd9be6e60aa19af2af2ea967 “fool she is and no mistake, just as i am.
0x7bc86bcca30a5fd2088f05734b65773c84b3d90b but why, if you are so clever, do you lie here like a sack and have nothing to show for it?
0xa0816b56b3c823d6dfe2729ba95a56290f7ea578 one time you used to go out, you say, to teach children.
0x9bf24805279b39077eccaa11651fac1e7ee48cf7 but why is it you do nothing now?”
0xe6f943d125c3c3f86119c69d7c55a7c7ea5a9cbe “i am doing...” raskolnikov began sullenly and reluctantly.
0xed62e52020f1687685fa70e342df78906206a81b “what are you doing?”
0x431ef218ad23170606e3a89dab58635011a82ed4 “work...” “what sort of work?”
0x314e13129e48be6400975367c3cd1f70638aa203 “i am thinking,” he answered seriously after a pause.
0x34565fb6f5480554f063a485782538b15405b6db nastasya was overcome with a fit of laughter.
0x03b93dd9ca586d0c262c18d01d36ea82cbe132bb she was given to laughter and when anything amused her, she laughed inaudibly, quivering and shaking all over till she felt ill. “and have you made much money by your thinking?”
0x21445342a66d96a262ff32607e2cefb58a5e25cd she managed to articulate at last.
0xafb4b6eb512593a5317981c084c70e19673e5dd7 “one can’t go out to give lessons without boots.
0xbed3863381708c936f49f91ddd8a64b9d05036f9 and i’m sick of it.”
0x83eaef457c28b96f8faa4cf7bc03a82d44efadad “don’t quarrel with your bread and butter.”
0x5bf58054b622a3e4cbaaf32823d1b0bfa19bfffe “they pay so little for lessons.
0x2708bc18af22c25f7894eecabbc470e519501e1e what’s the use of a few coppers?”
0xf8939279d1a7889b55042d616a7a7cde822d0623 he answered, reluctantly, as though replying to his own thought.
0x0ceb0fbd99596e2f2368873e76ab06622456c45c “and you want to get a fortune all at once?”
0x8c8ca709fee8e77472897784a01c8df4cb908024 he looked at her strangely.
0x07fc42b239df3c63973ef9a48c386c5581f6f813 “yes, i want a fortune,” he answered firmly, after a brief pause.
0x96d0e18aa5a0a9328b73ffcd57e474fecb97a755 “don’t be in such a hurry, you quite frighten me!
0x51f5c2391f6be787897ae3f145649c292f3d8e6e shall i get you the loaf or not?”
0x98fcc1518ff810931d0284e07565ece844c8562a “as you please.”
0x7483bb156b5e9cb4f3fc506eff8cd4b05b208ab8 “ah, i forgot!
0xee9261a7c272b9e4f9aa9c32df401d4df4f5cbc0 a letter came for you yesterday when you were out.”
0xdcf2aa60a7b8ebc4e6539217f12eb015268a5c02 “a letter?

0xab4ce5f9b4955bc15803e40d309db86f710712be “i can’t say.
0x7d28059d4f3d679dc2e3ce8ad563619e8dbe834a i gave three copecks of my own to the postman for it.
0xefcf567e5b58c31f536afeae501c86f0637d6367 will you pay me back?”
0xc62430843f76dad1ab17f9150912403082236c63 “then bring it to me, for god’s sake, bring it,” cried raskolnikov greatly excited--“good god!”
0x1decd46410433bbe7da8caebc6680932e823ab56 a minute later the letter was brought him.
0x79da27116bd50f9cf3c3432ed39abf922bf8aaa6 that was it: from his mother, from the province of r----.
0xb054cae0dde1e1efd678c5db4d6073c4b8bee30b he turned pale when he took it.
0x49609d00b5fe2715527ceec778c6320646c2e70a it was a long while since he had received a letter, but another feeling also suddenly stabbed his heart.
0xb778fdde9525caa2388cb915f0b621023428c289 “nastasya, leave me alone, for goodness’ sake; here are your three copecks, but for goodness’ sake, make haste and go!”
0xd17bcd515660cfa6f5549edba2d1fb12dcffceaf the letter was quivering in his hand; he did not want to open it in her presence; he wanted to be left _alone_ with this letter.
0xa184d47592c3a6cb8149a8753739c8269148c444 when nastasya had gone out, he lifted it quickly to his lips and kissed it; then he gazed intently at the address, the small, sloping handwriting, so dear and familiar, of the mother who had once taught him to read and write.
0xef10e04f092f8defecc5e009fc18a1f2c51be6fc he delayed; he seemed almost afraid of something.
0x59e4c4633dc7893650a4edace5248fca173805f0 at last he opened it; it was a thick heavy letter, weighing over two ounces, two large sheets of note paper were covered with very small handwriting.
0xeb54a1a9efbe859be52f4cc391087a8dd7a2f619 “my dear rodya,” wrote his mother--“it’s two months since i last had a talk with you by letter which has distressed me and even kept me awake at night, thinking.

0x7d397dc799d00fb64adbf10984c826442b1a2f25 he is a kind-hearted man and was a friend of your father’s too.
0x27e1a2eef4da7c7ad28d79428929a30caa0881f9 but having given him the right to receive the pension, i had to wait till the debt was paid off and that is only just done, so that i’ve been unable to send you anything all this time.
0x13680c54c5111b8e401bca642d541e6589b439a8 but now, thank god, i believe i shall be able to send you something more and in fact we may congratulate ourselves on our good fortune now, of which i hasten to inform you.
0x7d7364f3c6e22daaa223a96e360de6655b8a2209 in the first place, would you have guessed, dear rodya, that your sister has been living with me for the last six weeks and we shall not be separated in the future.
0x2426eee23826ba61cda7d4a44691577d4eb9308c thank god, her sufferings are over, but i will tell you everything in order, so that you may know just how everything has happened and all that we have hitherto concealed from you.
0xc643095ff413b52ef585b842520c3db3971058f8 when you wrote to me two months ago that you had heard that dounia had a great deal to put up with in the svidrigaïlovs’ house, when you wrote that and asked me to tell you all about it--what could i write in answer to you?
0x6f1fe1c54a899bb45651d639eb349d00045ecd0b if i had written the whole truth to you, i dare say you would have thrown up everything and have come to us, even if you had to walk all the way, for i know your character and your feelings, and you would not let your sister be insulted.
0x1587f14426a232b41e91286c4620820e72aa7369 i was in despair myself, but what could i do?
0x4bbc1d87b4835435d7ab1ffe116af2d41863210a and, besides, i did not know the whole truth myself then.
0x8361625ad624dcdb337909813782781141bf0a86 what made it all so difficult was that dounia received a hundred roubles in advance when she took the place as governess in their family, on condition of part of her salary being deducted every month, and so it was impossible to throw up the situation without repaying the debt.
0x9010e8363cd64999bcdd87c02b586045c485debf this sum (now i can explain it all to you, my precious rodya) she took chiefly in order to send you sixty roubles, which you needed so terribly then and which you received from us last year.
0x3172842e615efdd4b0c2a4950ae292d25b8181f3 we deceived you then, writing that this money came from dounia’s savings, but that was not so, and now i tell you all about it, because, thank god, things have suddenly changed for the better, and that you may know how dounia loves you and what a heart she has.
0xec75442ab8bc245f3096ca83865b9a9e567dafc7 at first indeed mr. svidrigaïlov treated her very rudely and used to make disrespectful and jeering remarks at table.... but i don’t want to go into all those painful details, so as not to worry you for nothing when it is now all over.
0xd05b48f9159de3207fe87ca3ce92f41bdffa09b9 in short, in spite of the kind and generous behaviour of marfa petrovna, mr. svidrigaïlov’s wife, and all the rest of the household, dounia had a very hard time, especially when mr. svidrigaïlov, relapsing into his old regimental habits, was under the influence of bacchus.
0xa02d1510ee12b7ecbad819fd38f9a19391453163 and how do you think it was all explained later on?
0x3530a8ffbe9d46c5dc30bcb99c04f9aa44a2103d would you believe that the crazy fellow had conceived a passion for dounia from the beginning, but had concealed it under a show of rudeness and contempt.
0xb531be47bb04299b2c3da94c43e8404824a8b884 possibly he was ashamed and horrified himself at his own flighty hopes, considering his years and his being the father of a family; and that made him angry with dounia.
0xb1153d4666f5c928751ccc57b0718eeb8ae1411e and possibly, too, he hoped by his rude and sneering behaviour to hide the truth from others.
0xf4b4c78fced98f88a4bb56525e4dd8930a4f3235 but at last he lost all control and had the face to make dounia an open and shameful proposal, promising her all sorts of inducements and offering, besides, to throw up everything and take her to another estate of his, or even abroad.
0x3e97d20eb777881e899dcb6a012236aba3f71e85 you can imagine all she went through!
0xec986b82b066985d7ebad8817015ed3eb7301999 to leave her situation at once was impossible not only on account of the money debt, but also to spare the feelings of marfa petrovna, whose suspicions would have been aroused: and then dounia would have been the cause of a rupture in the family.
0x1e81168802f2e399d3badb7c298b655a7d4e6e85 and it would have meant a terrible scandal for dounia too; that would have been inevitable.
0xe8773ebf41e8a90aefb4690d8a92c0218b6190a8 there were various other reasons owing to which dounia could not hope to escape from that awful house for another six weeks.
0x8fba07e3bc0cacaf7229b6c6b8dd2e4595eb9c9c you know dounia, of course; you know how clever she is and what a strong will she has.
0xa2d9485ac268a4ed01927313f9d746505c9f4623 dounia can endure a great deal and even in the most difficult cases she has the fortitude to maintain her firmness.
0x37ce42a355401b1b9b3d48d5c45b3cf494352072 she did not even write to me about everything for fear of upsetting me, although we were constantly in communication.
0x4f4e5e74144e226d0ef4ce1130000b8834b266e6 it all ended very unexpectedly.
0x7635c0c317b4c0fc14718366ec664b1c9132297f marfa petrovna accidentally overheard her husband imploring dounia in the garden, and, putting quite a wrong interpretation on the position, threw the blame upon her, believing her to be the cause of it all.
0xa4a1570fba54ca2ec23bca31abe62bec66bf8dd7 an awful scene took place between them on the spot in the garden; marfa petrovna went so far as to strike dounia, refused to hear anything and was shouting at her for a whole hour and then gave orders that dounia should be packed off at once to me in a plain peasant’s cart, into which they flung all her things, her linen and her clothes, all pell-mell, without folding it up and packing it.
0x032739bbdaff3c8d39b216ac298a95d05f6b3118 and a heavy shower of rain came on, too, and dounia, insulted and put to shame, had to drive with a peasant in an open cart all the seventeen versts into town.
0xb279496f73b8da6370d487507ba1fbace0686eae only think now what answer could i have sent to the letter i received from you two months ago and what could i have written?
0x0dc713cf54bea3ba527fcae0b36c37956f3c7b11 i was in despair; i dared not write to you the truth because you would have been very unhappy, mortified and indignant, and yet what could you do?
0x4db2bb2f3f8b1fb5f2fd1d185a64d1340fdc1f18 you could only perhaps ruin yourself, and, besides, dounia would not allow it; and fill up my letter with trifles when my heart was so full of sorrow, i could not.
0x80d6a7306978f369688c21f2adbb4ba1560b0f8c for a whole month the town was full of gossip about this scandal, and it came to such a pass that dounia and i dared not even go to church on account of the contemptuous looks, whispers, and even remarks made aloud about us.
0xa0dbcacfeff376b3cc8b576904d4197a2c3239dc all our acquaintances avoided us, nobody even bowed to us in the street, and i learnt that some shopmen and clerks were intending to insult us in a shameful way, smearing the gates of our house with pitch, so that the landlord began to tell us we must leave.
0xbca68fc7935e29fb24ad36b53e5732b584866f08 all this was set going by marfa petrovna who managed to slander dounia and throw dirt at her in every family.
0x259efe51e7b4eaa9a368655175e18214c74f5a2b she knows everyone in the neighbourhood, and that month she was continually coming into the town, and as she is rather talkative and fond of gossiping about her family affairs and particularly of complaining to all and each of her husband--which is not at all right--so in a short time she had spread her story not only in the town, but over the whole surrounding district.
0xc05ed803c4675ce56e5b84e16093e2be4dd7bd49 it made me ill, but dounia bore it better than i did, and if only you could have seen how she endured it all and tried to comfort me and cheer me up!
0x76ae0683dbf74c84b0d3d05b8e60aa424bd1cea4 she is an angel!
0xd64f53b0723c29b6a4f1a09d265089efb399675a but by god’s mercy, our sufferings were cut short: mr. svidrigaïlov returned to his senses and repented and, probably feeling sorry for dounia, he laid before marfa petrovna a complete and unmistakable proof of dounia’s innocence, in the form of a letter dounia had been forced to write and give to him, before marfa petrovna came upon them in the garden.
0xf631beb3ee4262dedc3ad37ed55baf76c031feeb this letter, which remained in mr. svidrigaïlov’s hands after her departure, she had written to refuse personal explanations and secret interviews, for which he was entreating her.
0x443fc11a6a7b95e014f77c6bab11049de60f720c in that letter she reproached him with great heat and indignation for the baseness of his behaviour in regard to marfa petrovna, reminding him that he was the father and head of a family and telling him how infamous it was of him to torment and make unhappy a defenceless girl, unhappy enough already.
0xa3e886196cc78e95e83806f388d3e49ccdc27dbb indeed, dear rodya, the letter was so nobly and touchingly written that i sobbed when i read it and to this day i cannot read it without tears.
0xb71d60e0d75256d35c0fd7cbd709af80067b2628 moreover, the evidence of the servants, too, cleared dounia’s reputation; they had seen and known a great deal more than mr. svidrigaïlov had himself supposed--as indeed is always the case with servants.
0xd6f9fc7881dd64d563149949ad9aa36acd4d904f marfa petrovna was completely taken aback, and ‘again crushed’ as she said herself to us, but she was completely convinced of dounia’s innocence.
0x9525ad0e0a0fb76fab5d013d76e3b0a3e3985996 the very next day, being sunday, she went straight to the cathedral, knelt down and prayed with tears to our lady to give her strength to bear this new trial and to do her duty.
0x48c7d7efe04cf5a846d531e32c26ef2088d386f2 then she came straight from the cathedral to us, told us the whole story, wept bitterly and, fully penitent, she embraced dounia and besought her to forgive her.
0x092678456c43fd1f65bfa93df5c47075c032c33d the same morning without any delay, she went round to all the houses in the town and everywhere, shedding tears, she asserted in the most flattering terms dounia’s innocence and the nobility of her feelings and her behavior.
0x66b959303bca7ffe7447731ebb2bcde2dfe14281 what was more, she showed and read to everyone the letter in dounia’s own handwriting to mr. svidrigaïlov and even allowed them to take copies of it--which i must say i think was superfluous.
0x4b2729e662a2b7a81538bb00df8c4352a87d94ed in this way she was busy for several days in driving about the whole town, because some people had taken offence through precedence having been given to others.
0x68fa14d9ab926954c26fef82ea87d487080e0eea and therefore they had to take turns, so that in every house she was expected before she arrived, and everyone knew that on such and such a day marfa petrovna would be reading the letter in such and such a place and people assembled for every reading of it, even many who had heard it several times already both in their own houses and in other people’s.
0xa54e280b7288c654cbd61f65ab0d7eff80a29360 in my opinion a great deal, a very great deal of all this was unnecessary; but that’s marfa petrovna’s character.
0x06070cb7404a388ff4b70d683a3431b585e17881 anyway she succeeded in completely re-establishing dounia’s reputation and the whole ignominy of this affair rested as an indelible disgrace upon her husband, as the only person to blame, so that i really began to feel sorry for him; it was really treating the crazy fellow too harshly.
0xbd1956c5ab477da7e10983206f4451904a689240 dounia was at once asked to give lessons in several families, but she refused.
0xf4497af9f171983f41c4af3f2355d5e33a480aad all of a sudden everyone began to treat her with marked respect and all this did much to bring about the event by which, one may say, our whole fortunes are now transformed.
0xbac1214387eada7c787178e4f6bc2e5c9d7553bf you must know, dear rodya, that dounia has a suitor and that she has already consented to marry him.
0x69bad75f5cd40911ff0c07ee4d3186b964b64979 i hasten to tell you all about the matter, and though it has been arranged without asking your consent, i think you will not be aggrieved with me or with your sister on that account, for you will see that we could not wait and put off our decision till we heard from you.
0xee87e14ecae3cc2c628fef5a07fb20671cd83a2b and you could not have judged all the facts without being on the spot.
0xd4cf48592c284844d19bba587cac6831a63945d1 this was how it happened.
0x3f4aac8e81a3aa14e8aa29337b57471f0b92859f he is already of the rank of a counsellor, pyotr petrovitch luzhin, and is distantly related to marfa petrovna, who has been very active in bringing the match about.
0x9d047da96927772362ac671c0f678292ab1a25bd it began with his expressing through her his desire to make our acquaintance.
0xd890b0d84afd867b22720f0d6c7c68c7e5163bb6 he was properly received, drank coffee with us and the very next day he sent us a letter in which he very courteously made an offer and begged for a speedy and decided answer.
0x21f5300da4e899e0ce3e59da4fc960c0404a485f he is a very busy man and is in a great hurry to get to petersburg, so that every moment is precious to him.
0xfff019757c92c247bd9a963708352846641a9787 at first, of course, we were greatly surprised, as it had all happened so quickly and unexpectedly.
0x4f684cef7a379288f00da29a5559caa1474dc28f we thought and talked it over the whole day.
0x047658c0b369b9136b69195baf49bf09521a7d79 he is a well-to-do man, to be depended upon, he has two posts in the government and has already made his fortune.
0x5fba652a01e997a81378b5974a9555d61a979b63 it is true that he is forty-five years old, but he is of a fairly prepossessing appearance and might still be thought attractive by women, and he is altogether a very respectable and presentable man, only he seems a little morose and somewhat conceited.
0xf4261b7a4a0581b140c523551127e14cc393b0c1 but possibly that may only be the impression he makes at first sight.
0xc758f5869877a9bf35755f2d3f1be705c7222099 and beware, dear rodya, when he comes to petersburg, as he shortly will do, beware of judging him too hastily and severely, as your way is, if there is anything you do not like in him at first sight.
0x279002e79239a168503d3b2a8cc8a5c92256b282 i give you this warning, although i feel sure that he will make a favourable impression upon you.
0x1f7f0fefb107d1a8e19c1b5dba3409cb10e7633b moreover, in order to understand any man one must be deliberate and careful to avoid forming prejudices and mistaken ideas, which are very difficult to correct and get over afterwards.
0x9a7212159d66ba50575256d5f87b6b6405dd6eae and pyotr petrovitch, judging by many indications, is a thoroughly estimable man.
0xede8798ab34b95c9ecd04e5ed05e78aa1cc25b31 at his first visit, indeed, he told us that he was a practical man, but still he shares, as he expressed it, many of the convictions ‘of our most rising generation’ and he is an opponent of all prejudices.
0x357e234b47097c3738c3ad4d5477ed44dfb133f6 he said a good deal more, for he seems a little conceited and likes to be listened to, but this is scarcely a vice.
0x9f566b28c4b156590cd31675a78b1cf8be0f9446 i, of course, understood very little of it, but dounia explained to me that, though he is not a man of great education, he is clever and seems to be good-natured.
0x6b14c0b12b8b1815f57bc12f27fe50849e953896 you know your sister’s character, rodya.
0x35d9e0ea6b3c21c80ea550bf8c937989cf6d1399 she is a resolute, sensible, patient and generous girl, but she has a passionate heart, as i know very well.
0x8e9f03f6d164e3dbb9b679499cf9a093554eb89a of course, there is no great love either on his side, or on hers, but dounia is a clever girl and has the heart of an angel, and will make it her duty to make her husband happy who on his side will make her happiness his care.
0xcb252d779ef5740288603354ea869ff32ad0c620 of that we have no good reason to doubt, though it must be admitted the matter has been arranged in great haste.
0xf752db1fe4d80855161d58835afbefe01afaec4c besides he is a man of great prudence and he will see, to be sure, of himself, that his own happiness will be the more secure, the happier dounia is with him.
0xfd49cc4a5dc89c7fb8ed267341d392754184893d and as for some defects of character, for some habits and even certain differences of opinion--which indeed are inevitable even in the happiest marriages--dounia has said that, as regards all that, she relies on herself, that there is nothing to be uneasy about, and that she is ready to put up with a great deal, if only their future relationship can be an honourable and straightforward one.
0xddd62dd65e543dcea635ec439af306526ef8292f he struck me, for instance, at first, as rather abrupt, but that may well come from his being an outspoken man, and that is no doubt how it is.
0xbb9dd7d8cc5ac7975db6e9a10d22be4ff75742bd for instance, at his second visit, after he had received dounia’s consent, in the course of conversation, he declared that before making dounia’s acquaintance, he had made up his mind to marry a girl of good reputation, without dowry and, above all, one who had experienced poverty, because, as he explained, a man ought not to be indebted to his wife, but that it is better for a wife to look upon her husband as her benefactor.
0x51020737a29be989270c5928bf644cd0b236cd38 i must add that he expressed it more nicely and politely than i have done, for i have forgotten his actual phrases and only remember the meaning.
0x0f7fdfb9a0e1b9c23dc61c7ac1fe8243e2c30ed7 and, besides, it was obviously not said of design, but slipped out in the heat of conversation, so that he tried afterwards to correct himself and smooth it over, but all the same it did strike me as somewhat rude, and i said so afterwards to dounia.
0x89165072a89c1e5cc5bb785868835c58630dcada but dounia was vexed, and answered that ‘words are not deeds,’ and that, of course, is perfectly true.
0xe38df417c49d3e87f3a8c5393630f89b5399cad9 dounia did not sleep all night before she made up her mind, and, thinking that i was asleep, she got out of bed and was walking up and down the room all night; at last she knelt down before the ikon and prayed long and fervently and in the morning she told me that she had decided.
0x624fdb141d3ce1b05e7d624d7a0e88dc9f18a3eb “i have mentioned already that pyotr petrovitch is just setting off for petersburg, where he has a great deal of business, and he wants to open a legal bureau.
0xe7e338e7ee5b8d38b8b40dfa247a349c37bb500c he has been occupied for many years in conducting civil and commercial litigation, and only the other day he won an important case.
0x215975287f1c02eda4cdcddbc0c43c13f8972110 he has to be in petersburg because he has an important case before the senate.
0xf910c7b0c521e687d344b5c19bbd51b7677b74d1 so, rodya dear, he may be of the greatest use to you, in every way indeed, and dounia and i have agreed that from this very day you could definitely enter upon your career and might consider that your future is marked out and assured for you.
0x2fbb4e812bee2478399b09f0ac2dcbb8bcb29713 oh, if only this comes to pass!
0x461caed04d05c3896dc1c659c9545489d6ccfb0b this would be such a benefit that we could only look upon it as a providential blessing.
0x4f6e25c18f1f7eea20825fd9f713ab9aefe82446 dounia is dreaming of nothing else.
0x27195d68bdf14d79d2098760ab7c5e69800c7bb2 we have even ventured already to drop a few words on the subject to pyotr petrovitch.
0x892ae34d93fb8d8d9389bddccd8c0c4ae6f3cc01 he was cautious in his answer, and said that, of course, as he could not get on without a secretary, it would be better to be paying a salary to a relation than to a stranger, if only the former were fitted for the duties (as though there could be doubt of your being fitted!)
0x9c03e9c84e9bc40647c88b01653dd57f634a537c but then he expressed doubts whether your studies at the university would leave you time for work at his office.
0x4a5ea9282fe3bc0e47edb64144ae4d07228bc6a3 the matter dropped for the time, but dounia is thinking of nothing else now.
0x690cb52acde351fb6ede0cb061c20ca255ec2141 she has been in a sort of fever for the last few days, and has already made a regular plan for your becoming in the end an associate and even a partner in pyotr petrovitch’s business, which might well be, seeing that you are a student of law.
0x45b52d49b1456e40aa37031ed626ac857644d953 i am in complete agreement with her, rodya, and share all her plans and hopes, and think there is every probability of realising them.
0x5456f4562c9f843e56042b842fb43981195dee3e and in spite of pyotr petrovitch’s evasiveness, very natural at present (since he does not know you), dounia is firmly persuaded that she will gain everything by her good influence over her future husband; this she is reckoning upon.
0x1a005be4b1347592a1664808189eb3e3456e940a of course we are careful not to talk of any of these more remote plans to pyotr petrovitch, especially of your becoming his partner.
0x07e37bdf2e8cabe1d62fe6964b51459144057088 he is a practical man and might take this very coldly, it might all seem to him simply a day-dream.
0x284eca9f7e05a8afcdfff7e90fb5594fca4d3c37 nor has either dounia or i breathed a word to him of the great hopes we have of his helping us to pay for your university studies; we have not spoken of it in the first place, because it will come to pass of itself, later on, and he will no doubt without wasting words offer to do it of himself, (as though he could refuse dounia that) the more readily since you may by your own efforts become his right hand in the office, and receive this assistance not as a charity, but as a salary earned by your own work.
0x6dbacb224b93cb35fc5b51b50ccda2abf105166f dounia wants to arrange it all like this and i quite agree with her.
0x3100a5da71164a916011ca697ff1415030251408 and we have not spoken of our plans for another reason, that is, because i particularly wanted you to feel on an equal footing when you first meet him.
0xa6f296ea77211f6d90035328ff3cb1868e4ff378 when dounia spoke to him with enthusiasm about you, he answered that one could never judge of a man without seeing him close, for oneself, and that he looked forward to forming his own opinion when he makes your acquaintance.
0xd20e218e1ec5e5cc1d2d106e0dc6dbf180903705 do you know, my precious rodya, i think that perhaps for some reasons (nothing to do with pyotr petrovitch though, simply for my own personal, perhaps old-womanish, fancies) i should do better to go on living by myself, apart, than with them, after the wedding.
0x2197c5be45165e31ab4f39015956ef811d1e5b17 i am convinced that he will be generous and delicate enough to invite me and to urge me to remain with my daughter for the future, and if he has said nothing about it hitherto, it is simply because it has been taken for granted; but i shall refuse.
0x7816df12622536fae83719351e7e4e830e24df6b i have noticed more than once in my life that husbands don’t quite get on with their mothers-in-law, and i don’t want to be the least bit in anyone’s way, and for my own sake, too, would rather be quite independent, so long as i have a crust of bread of my own, and such children as you and dounia.
0x49834cd7afc08abc98d72da46e60557eb9985b43 if possible, i would settle somewhere near you, for the most joyful piece of news, dear rodya, i have kept for the end of my letter: know then, my dear boy, that we may, perhaps, be all together in a very short time and may embrace one another again after a separation of almost three years!
0xc6225bf222a4d1f2d4515f8249bd01346e03f6fc it is settled _for certain_ that dounia and i are to set off for petersburg, exactly when i don’t know, but very, very soon, possibly in a week.
0xd9aeaff70cfdcc847cde3ca084cc354bf66c1244 it all depends on pyotr petrovitch who will let us know when he has had time to look round him in petersburg.
0x176921dc1260dd19f3033f3cda654d5dfb3ce63a to suit his own arrangements he is anxious to have the ceremony as soon as possible, even before the fast of our lady, if it could be managed, or if that is too soon to be ready, immediately after.
0x73ed3279ccad1cf4e563ba5825de06e801d065ce oh, with what happiness i shall press you to my heart!
0x1121b5268ca4cb95e429465d7d605b17b77fe9c5 dounia is all excitement at the joyful thought of seeing you, she said one day in joke that she would be ready to marry pyotr petrovitch for that alone.
0x76ae0683dbf74c84b0d3d05b8e60aa424bd1cea4 she is an angel!
0x483ab81c4899a3cb342915eed378d91eef84de6d she is not writing anything to you now, and has only told me to write that she has so much, so much to tell you that she is not going to take up her pen now, for a few lines would tell you nothing, and it would only mean upsetting herself; she bids me send you her love and innumerable kisses.
0x296d96483564dfd9e5bf75f9e37c54c50aedf06c but although we shall be meeting so soon, perhaps i shall send you as much money as i can in a day or two.
0x24bd1f8d0f0b33a647147c0a3eb26a27346d8fe3 now that everyone has heard that dounia is to marry pyotr petrovitch, my credit has suddenly improved and i know that afanasy ivanovitch will trust me now even to seventy-five roubles on the security of my pension, so that perhaps i shall be able to send you twenty-five or even thirty roubles.
0xb13ebcf9aa824f86d75cdd4afdab0bc237b9ae7c i would send you more, but i am uneasy about our travelling expenses; for though pyotr petrovitch has been so kind as to undertake part of the expenses of the journey, that is to say, he has taken upon himself the conveyance of our bags and big trunk (which will be conveyed through some acquaintances of his), we must reckon upon some expense on our arrival in petersburg, where we can’t be left without a halfpenny, at least for the first few days.
0x7a866df73fe6750683b667706c48c36c36b39b8b but we have calculated it all, dounia and i, to the last penny, and we see that the journey will not cost very much.
0xcd3390827435ef06643f2a957fe82a76006179b3 it is only ninety versts from us to the railway and we have come to an agreement with a driver we know, so as to be in readiness; and from there dounia and i can travel quite comfortably third class.
0x7fa4d7e8c99c10d790f068b404ccb3f62bf469a1 so that i may very likely be able to send to you not twenty-five, but thirty roubles.
0xe41fe6154b0ed834666e4394e606f06e8b84d15e but enough; i have covered two sheets already and there is no space left for more; our whole history, but so many events have happened!
0xc7dcd3e301cca723306a9b895edadeecbd8163fe and now, my precious rodya, i embrace you and send you a mother’s blessing till we meet.
0x3fe784f30735dfde3e350134be196c7c0b5a1846 love dounia your sister, rodya; love her as she loves you and understand that she loves you beyond everything, more than herself.
0x25190e4d1c38623b22199161d2c08ae7af2f6aec she is an angel and you, rodya, you are everything to us--our one hope, our one consolation.
0xd10429e09df565ea4920555c5f763b967765ba12 if only you are happy, we shall be happy.
0xc5ddd933533f9d39455af54f144c4b0ed1211be3 do you still say your prayers, rodya, and believe in the mercy of our creator and our redeemer?
0x4e6d8566c730978044781027bd3210c622909129 i am afraid in my heart that you may have been visited by the new spirit of infidelity that is abroad to-day; if it is so, i pray for you.
0xf7a0a3d8ad5d833d74c7015e227af5910f9e746b remember, dear boy, how in your childhood, when your father was living, you used to lisp your prayers at my knee, and how happy we all were in those days.
0xff884a16c0932989aec99f1d58afbdfe52e13e98 good-bye, till we meet then--i embrace you warmly, warmly, with many kisses.
0x44b2d2dbfe6fe772b72c395b7b4e2e6a9d20709a “yours till death, “pulcheria raskolnikov.”
0xc833375b3af80a0a622bb7001db054bf4ea0a295 almost from the first, while he read the letter, raskolnikov’s face was wet with tears; but when he finished it, his face was pale and distorted and a bitter, wrathful and malignant smile was on his lips.
0xbfea0850ccc6efb7067bcb6d2f9c75741d81e5fb he laid his head down on his threadbare dirty pillow and pondered, pondered a long time.
0xeb2b9a403958c4cb3e0c76af46928f33a450f827 his heart was beating violently, and his brain was in a turmoil.
0x1e3140d151d25e800b8dec195964e770173f3959 at last he felt cramped and stifled in the little yellow room that was like a cupboard or a box.
0x86596897fa2cf280edda3d10cff0dda5dd97800f his eyes and his mind craved for space.
0xbaa2939a17dec81488941720271dd26daeaa8304 he took up his hat and went out, this time without dread of meeting anyone; he had forgotten his dread.
0xd2a4849a57930923910497d5a19789647e99dbb2 he turned in the direction of the vassilyevsky ostrov, walking along vassilyevsky prospect, as though hastening on some business, but he walked, as his habit was, without noticing his way, muttering and even speaking aloud to himself, to the astonishment of the passers-by.
0x32507dcc3eac4394f8ab983b51def7ef3b60baa0 many of them took him to be drunk.
0xef1d35fcd46cfca5b84ca5bd2d572ba8f5f0e0c6 chapter iv his mother’s letter had been a torture to him, but as regards the chief fact in it, he had felt not one moment’s hesitation, even whilst he was reading the letter.
0x622a6fec17fb39a61b8581508f4269f1c5bbca23 the essential question was settled, and irrevocably settled, in his mind: “never such a marriage while i am alive and mr. luzhin be damned!”
0x159b3ba3c2069712275150f8dfcab6fb20c6bc1a “the thing is perfectly clear,” he muttered to himself, with a malignant smile anticipating the triumph of his decision.
0xbd939bb5c9e31840f9dbf4acc579fff7d291b23d “no, mother, no, dounia, you won’t deceive me!
0xd95193f530273232f2293216e2556288e71cedba and then they apologise for not asking my advice and for taking the decision without me!
0x5a24931d0b02b01b64281d2e548e631b0dae6981 i dare say!
0x9c89f4cabf1284355934d894c06219e364c77b58 they imagine it is arranged now and can’t be broken off; but we will see whether it can or not!
0xf479c7c04c020f171968ce2acb9a4ac316a65609 a magnificent excuse: ‘pyotr petrovitch is such a busy man that even his wedding has to be in post-haste, almost by express.’
0x779d6e096e4f3e12933acf7429b92cf5c4dafdad no, dounia, i see it all and i know what you want to say to me; and i know too what you were thinking about, when you walked up and down all night, and what your prayers were like before the holy mother of kazan who stands in mother’s bedroom.
0x323e24780752245702618b14199fe89084920c4c bitter is the ascent to golgotha.... hm... so it is finally settled; you have determined to marry a sensible business man, avdotya romanovna, one who has a fortune (has _already_ made his fortune, that is so much more solid and impressive), a man who holds two government posts and who shares the ideas of our most rising generation, as mother writes, and who _seems_ to be kind, as dounia herself observes.
0x53375c44c372fe125948f701e6f6564a20d7fc42 that _seems_ beats everything!
0x9d57de825dc58404faedacd1ca2e4ab1f151d7ee and that very dounia for that very ‘_seems_’ is marrying him!
0x917520abe3ffb7af02c93dc2a0d40311eec306fd splendid!
0x917520abe3ffb7af02c93dc2a0d40311eec306fd splendid!
0xf333159fdb28ec91f7ae16686ac707fb14fd48a1 “... but i should like to know why mother has written to me about ‘our most rising generation’?
0x742239bbb1fe2dcdc113f0f9ea6efc050e1bff00 simply as a descriptive touch, or with the idea of prepossessing me in favour of mr. luzhin?
0x5e6f8ca5660ec606db54279978d10087cdca81b7 oh, the cunning of them!
0x5736d7fdef56a99432fdf5a8b1e50ebe6edb017a i should like to know one thing more: how far they were open with one another that day and night and all this time since?
0x9c93de428a376dd4aa5246fb2d5e381bdd7f6b3e was it all put into _words_, or did both understand that they had the same thing at heart and in their minds, so that there was no need to speak of it aloud, and better not to speak of it.
0x2f5eed1d8849377fff1357301880f7608e27810c most likely it was partly like that, from mother’s letter it’s evident: he struck her as rude _a little_, and mother in her simplicity took her observations to dounia.
0xba46eb0adc3144429b5bddd8c160e062b54aeca3 and she was sure to be vexed and ‘answered her angrily.’
0x9d4b570473cce64a45779e91a2f254c2d967ffbf i should think so!
0xb50dd2f43fa4bc42c7dc9ef86d3cd6ba71f35b1a who would not be angered when it was quite clear without any naïve questions and when it was understood that it was useless to discuss it.
0x012dff41fc269479fb11ba611d964f15a7f096d4 and why does she write to me, ‘love dounia, rodya, and she loves you more than herself’?
0x9c68f93204c6e2d81ff51b07a763da6a34d7ae07 has she a secret conscience-prick at sacrificing her daughter to her son?
0xfba891ce25bf5dd3dd2affb41f4a453b43e6f8b8 ‘you are our one comfort, you are everything to us.’
0x87d3eb67f69aecc342d0881031df5e608ebcc236 oh, mother!”
0x018654d9ea95da935e03d07aa2d4912c6e69b9cb his bitterness grew more and more intense, and if he had happened to meet mr. luzhin at the moment, he might have murdered him.
0xc3ac164b1acf08c44eb607b9f0c0c28bc903b026 “hm... yes, that’s true,” he continued, pursuing the whirling ideas that chased each other in his brain, “it is true that ‘it needs time and care to get to know a man,’ but there is no mistake about mr. luzhin.
0x723addd9a7262f707b56f57dd809788b9ada959d the chief thing is he is ‘a man of business and _seems_ kind,’ that was something, wasn’t it, to send the bags and big box for them!
0x264f716a020b5bd35eb657ef336168dfab65a185 a kind man, no doubt after that!
0x045369c2e7f023e9d4beb051b23b5b8eba2741a2 but his _bride_ and her mother are to drive in a peasant’s cart covered with sacking (i know, i have been driven in it).
0x3f88cd8d72cf699e52acee1669fd886eebde71aa no matter!
0x92d928d035daf5edb3a20952af50faf743a33c6b it is only ninety versts and then they can ‘travel very comfortably, third class,’ for a thousand versts!
0x6ae710d10733ed9a8dff7494fcbf61126f7703a5 quite right, too.
0x25097d9e8132258addeb9c4af1c1571982d1864f one must cut one’s coat according to one’s cloth, but what about you, mr. luzhin?
0x1d0309e2d63f54aff54d98e3f221d13c32c56f3d she is your bride.... and you must be aware that her mother has to raise money on her pension for the journey.
0xba416b5a94c30be82809a30bf423b708466f3b08 to be sure it’s a matter of business, a partnership for mutual benefit, with equal shares and expenses;--food and drink provided, but pay for your tobacco.
0x0bae1a6da949eb9ea9bcc454253d407add27bd35 the business man has got the better of them, too.
0x2dff396ae4e7b78798889f7a1cb4eaf864dc631b the luggage will cost less than their fares and very likely go for nothing.
0x0f561a56acc92f93978fa21575d0c1af4991f005 how is it that they don’t both see all that, or is it that they don’t want to see?
0x3e2a4ef54d54274efd3b7f7bf3bc0a12fcc0d830 and they are pleased, pleased!
0x9979bc3a0244dcd6341718f3b50e0506cb90c047 and to think that this is only the first blossoming, and that the real fruits are to come!
0x275a1397edaa4b47514c59c5e619d1b594a4a971 but what really matters is not the stinginess, is not the meanness, but the _tone_ of the whole thing.
0xd8492a3fd0ca172119c38c00f40c8d9baf0ad073 for that will be the tone after marriage, it’s a foretaste of it.
0xada6b22f16d5ece09865523a311dcb73db9e8e21 and mother too, why should she be so lavish?
0x770ea70fbb95f1ba5a1fa84b1bb981ba9ecdc41e what will she have by the time she gets to petersburg?
0x61c6f5b9946035b016775557da89d103679e6dc1 three silver roubles or two ‘paper ones’ as _she_ says.... that old woman... hm.
0x3f9a9f66adc9005941c4bce6ae3fb967f5c03d8f what does she expect to live upon in petersburg afterwards?
0xa384465f15a05954fa6fa1638026b7c39b4a8aee she has her reasons already for guessing that she _could not_ live with dounia after the marriage, even for the first few months.
0x91aee525a69aadf9af740802c8af3b65dd1eda13 the good man has no doubt let slip something on that subject also, though mother would deny it: ‘i shall refuse,’ says she.
0x21a1770b55d55095da0968e0d1a620156695118d on whom is she reckoning then?
0xbdd97ad68fe7c0a4d338f5e6624271ff3d70ef79 is she counting on what is left of her hundred and twenty roubles of pension when afanasy ivanovitch’s debt is paid?
0xfef10217d12b8ecdb205b236e1c630c5a9b034d8 she knits woollen shawls and embroiders cuffs, ruining her old eyes.
0xdd30b39db83f57737bd725f410e4b7d515e86885 and all her shawls don’t add more than twenty roubles a year to her hundred and twenty, i know that.
0x96a5dc4f26786bd2fc7e1213f6bb3b487b143955 so she is building all her hopes all the time on mr. luzhin’s generosity; ‘he will offer it of himself, he will press it on me.’
0xedd6cbba1a940818b795fef6ef02622e6e3f688b you may wait a long time for that!
0x3225ec9884dad45faf15f00e46e21a3f2a37c186 that’s how it always is with these schilleresque noble hearts; till the last moment every goose is a swan with them, till the last moment, they hope for the best and will see nothing wrong, and although they have an inkling of the other side of the picture, yet they won’t face the truth till they are forced to; the very thought of it makes them shiver; they thrust the truth away with both hands, until the man they deck out in false colours puts a fool’s cap on them with his own hands.
0xb1fb32ddee11fafd3770b37c3bf69776be790353 i should like to know whether mr. luzhin has any orders of merit; i bet he has the anna in his buttonhole and that he puts it on when he goes to dine with contractors or merchants.
0xfa5350b0a83687c19263087ea22c4114213d07e4 he will be sure to have it for his wedding, too!
0x717df8be71553a31dcc2a57ea21c227e1440b523 enough of him, confound him!
0x3f1bcb49e1398e244dc3a889726b24bcff915788 “well,... mother i don’t wonder at, it’s like her, god bless her, but how could dounia?
0x5ed7d0467f3134456178cfb3d351485e25f9b8f4 dounia darling, as though i did not know you!
0x80bb5a711e09500e91b5de4c14cab5e895e55627 you were nearly twenty when i saw you last: i understood you then.
0xdb2ef538409dec3c890825c71c4bd53592470469 mother writes that ‘dounia can put up with a great deal.’
0x6bc09c1a7bf6b8ec0fd49d1d1cce0b5a12658ec9 i know that very well.
0x6772e8ccc3d83e93ceeaa96d675463c55550a089 i knew that two years and a half ago, and for the last two and a half years i have been thinking about it, thinking of just that, that ‘dounia can put up with a great deal.’
0xe87ce5a5eed47430b5dc15eacec22502eb2a9f1a if she could put up with mr. svidrigaïlov and all the rest of it, she certainly can put up with a great deal.
0xdf64583a3339f6ca9c312da89fa493e2912d66c9 and now mother and she have taken it into their heads that she can put up with mr. luzhin, who propounds the theory of the superiority of wives raised from destitution and owing everything to their husband’s bounty--who propounds it, too, almost at the first interview.
0xc4b24cf9054414c07fe78ac9c9535ed91906b7bf granted that he ‘let it slip,’ though he is a sensible man, (yet maybe it was not a slip at all, but he meant to make himself clear as soon as possible) but dounia, dounia?
0x915d4e4844bfe3ff2893a6250185678d1c4dab56 she understands the man, of course, but she will have to live with the man.
0x2d5b25d453abe8fb6d060485993327a6ff549083 why!
0x235c25a8bb28d456ad616f646736785a4bfbc0dd she’d live on black bread and water, she would not sell her soul, she would not barter her moral freedom for comfort; she would not barter it for all schleswig-holstein, much less mr. luzhin’s money.
0x13c4359478f1b07ddb2d93137ba7fc76fb3dfd15 no, dounia was not that sort when i knew her and... she is still the same, of course!
0xb068d251f39c6311c5dac3143ac77780bf278a9f yes, there’s no denying, the svidrigaïlovs are a bitter pill!
0x391c78ebd24b467749219efeb72f5109504b062e it’s a bitter thing to spend one’s life a governess in the provinces for two hundred roubles, but i know she would rather be a nigger on a plantation or a lett with a german master than degrade her soul, and her moral dignity, by binding herself for ever to a man whom she does not respect and with whom she has nothing in common--for her own advantage.
0x0c1aaa3163c2b39c0e4ac8c1281f51dd21de9f75 and if mr. luzhin had been of unalloyed gold, or one huge diamond, she would never have consented to become his legal concubine.
0xc380c743d47e64ce74ff10d55ea001213929b2ec why is she consenting then?
0xde1f08ea7adbbd82852dbd4815aca18bf93778c9 what’s the point of it?
0x66235701e2e22197d84a80a1327ba716bfa8b1c6 what’s the answer?
0xbb8529c9e668372b41a181533bf34cb07d23a0c6 it’s clear enough: for herself, for her comfort, to save her life she would not sell herself, but for someone else she is doing it!
0xbda743ad7ed2643a9ca7af5171b23a63603f5114 for one she loves, for one she adores, she will sell herself!
0xe29a4e89ecf51c74c7eebbe41e99566e301d3b1e that’s what it all amounts to; for her brother, for her mother, she will sell herself!
0xed447ba4c646cd16a973a0f306f577b64aca1494 she will sell everything!
0xb32314fb3319597244fcb7ec69e0d0958763d3eb in such cases, ‘we overcome our moral feeling if necessary,’ freedom, peace, conscience even, all, all are brought into the market.
0x7e76e00c81447a370d43225205f3bf1b9cfbf942 let my life go, if only my dear ones may be happy!
0x7b61f530dc749d882469d93c8eb5848ede20c513 more than that, we become casuists, we learn to be jesuitical and for a time maybe we can soothe ourselves, we can persuade ourselves that it is one’s duty for a good object.
0xc336ce8b8a894ce0a867a29fcef904fcee1a1266 that’s just like us, it’s as clear as daylight.
0x67cae5d42b3539159b21fd96d5900ff684e95220 it’s clear that rodion romanovitch raskolnikov is the central figure in the business, and no one else.
0xdfa9c277b2566d68cac10a47145c17bd22c8f6dd oh, yes, she can ensure his happiness, keep him in the university, make him a partner in the office, make his whole future secure; perhaps he may even be a rich man later on, prosperous, respected, and may even end his life a famous man!
0xd1c49152a6d82adb5a2e543d04978f0f1e2935b3 but my mother?
0xee4e44b28ca9dbfe37df1bea9b1e87aecb4907ef it’s all rodya, precious rodya, her first born!
0x6af61705dca58bb1750f05373b6ffd9d2249c682 for such a son who would not sacrifice such a daughter!
0x2b7c0799d31b110c86059db2da481265060ae8f4 oh, loving, over-partial hearts!
0x35501dfc0836fe421c7376f36f9d66a277e38925 why, for his sake we would not shrink even from sonia’s fate.
0x2633a43bd082c6ff3e8e727594daaed23a038cdc sonia, sonia marmeladov, the eternal victim so long as the world lasts.
0x7fce9c255a112e7d57f14274bf5eb815f09de2c1 have you taken the measure of your sacrifice, both of you?

0x4c6b3983d6db2f091a5ec5b394fc0d9fccb42c88 can you bear it?
0x794a8477217a345e8d6e4d0ce48558dbab22279e is it any use?
0x9897c9bd304712f51cc161b44d10ffe4081f939f is there sense in it?
0x925b181b1e3941319bddad5357aed0e9d9f229cb and let me tell you, dounia, sonia’s life is no worse than life with mr. luzhin.
0x01038409ed66ff4327a238a49f7a9a8c78eb0825 ‘there can be no question of love,’ mother writes.
0x69356af0968720bf315b67b86d93725945fb8e90 and what if there can be no respect either, if on the contrary there is aversion, contempt, repulsion, what then?
0xb0bd467b008329596b9d818856a6b914d023b64e so you will have to ‘keep up your appearance,’ too.
0x9f1ed97a4c3e3e1f75ddfb45b8f13145e8f9a995 is not that so?
0x30d03ee8b8d89a1748c37fe9e9100d07e2dcd22c do you understand what that smartness means?
0xc9e36dab354386cf027cd1595e453dd29ecada85 do you understand that the luzhin smartness is just the same thing as sonia’s and may be worse, viler, baser, because in your case, dounia, it’s a bargain for luxuries, after all, but with sonia it’s simply a question of starvation.
0x419604c86c584f70e0adf0264b47bb5572adbd60 it has to be paid for, it has to be paid for, dounia, this smartness.
0x29f7c7cdd36cb522d8c7bf1e973a9001fb885808 and what if it’s more than you can bear afterwards, if you regret it?
0x03886d682eeb31d6868098909af4b7bae98ad07a the bitterness, the misery, the curses, the tears hidden from all the world, for you are not a marfa petrovna.
0x748834fd850a407e78f5d7ca721a59f935f78a0a and how will your mother feel then?
0xb5e909f31e86726d45b3ddbcfb6be53f84216df1 even now she is uneasy, she is worried, but then, when she sees it all clearly?
0x4563e8d69837091f983548d7687dfaeb86d07ae0 and i?
0x0d888761422820018d7a7db99c9870012f5f2ad5 yes, indeed, what have you taken me for?
0x789268f9efe6cfc5df926b3fb3b40b91f029b5a3 i won’t have your sacrifice, dounia, i won’t have it, mother!

0xd326a40cd74c956780e25865210548b5a3681cf8 i won’t accept it!”
0x040d05d6a8108cc57a90b4d739972d2930f31ece he suddenly paused in his reflection and stood still.
0x2b21831aa142e53f1a83a7d70161d131c1562148 “it shall not be?
0x9226b9a1e9797820ae766549f174197526642760 but what are you going to do to prevent it?
0x67f61b01f87ac664903fe781891b608b9baa1b3a you’ll forbid it?

0xcc7e75046ba04da6a1f617fe275c0bbf524c0a4b what can you promise them on your side to give you such a right?
0x72b464989d26dacfd1b11295b1585aceb6d09384 your whole life, your whole future, you will devote to them _when you have finished your studies and obtained a post_?

0xd42b2d153c0e8c78dae369836a906b0d32412d0c in another ten years?
0x6c4ec571bed8a0f70338f5046493fbe8f217991a in another ten years, mother will be blind with knitting shawls, maybe with weeping too.
0x95739c0ba98029304478675d55caf9fbdff6f59a she will be worn to a shadow with fasting; and my sister?
0x0cbb63fa6ce84d75e54b5bc708dfe0f1af04b3c2 imagine for a moment what may have become of your sister in ten years?
0x190974ac2557ebfa35b0ef94546b8324056ca13c what may happen to her during those ten years?
0xafd2dc76e03367e090115bd70b3a56feade563f8 can you fancy?”
0x948b5287614120088286e69ec095f48283f07b9e so he tortured himself, fretting himself with such questions, and finding a kind of enjoyment in it.
0xefe6a5be0558cc786b00019a8fbdcc0b07a222f9 and yet all these questions were not new ones suddenly confronting him, they were old familiar aches.
0xe24911b42f199c11ea058e95b2f7310d819cac45 it was long since they had first begun to grip and rend his heart.
0xa135e9da102cf0e9a48d00e36004adb5de6839ca long, long ago his present anguish had its first beginnings; it had waxed and gathered strength, it had matured and concentrated, until it had taken the form of a fearful, frenzied and fantastic question, which tortured his heart and mind, clamouring insistently for an answer.
0xd146a7326e203ac3646df776ee883fc0a9a13d2b now his mother’s letter had burst on him like a thunderclap.
0x1cbdd8d010feebfab441fe92c20932231deba68a it was clear that he must not now suffer passively, worrying himself over unsolved questions, but that he must do something, do it at once, and do it quickly.
0x6717b8b211fa7542919f847a32d70bf85c6c3445 anyway he must decide on something, or else... “or throw up life altogether!”
0xc22f42aba147c4b4b30ff53b026046f9bc65404c he cried suddenly, in a frenzy--“accept one’s lot humbly as it is, once for all and stifle everything in oneself, giving up all claim to activity, life and love!”
0xe6ba2f4781acac31c2b4b12f547bccd10242558f “do you understand, sir, do you understand what it means when you have absolutely nowhere to turn?”
0x5472ccd87ff76ea0046608144b8a565f2117775d marmeladov’s question came suddenly into his mind, “for every man must have somewhere to turn....” he gave a sudden start; another thought, that he had had yesterday, slipped back into his mind.
0x0a463a070fc830d5e5a1388cf4b07d7b7e42681a but he did not start at the thought recurring to him, for he knew, he had _felt beforehand_, that it must come back, he was expecting it; besides it was not only yesterday’s thought.
0xe59086c62317cc16b65671c740f1a54719b89f13 the difference was that a month ago, yesterday even, the thought was a mere dream: but now... now it appeared not a dream at all, it had taken a new menacing and quite unfamiliar shape, and he suddenly became aware of this himself.... he felt a hammering in his head, and there was a darkness before his eyes.
0xd746058dbfe23c08ffc4fe5f6f0d02d6f6c35af3 he looked round hurriedly, he was searching for something.
0x6249d4b34e7a2c9f9e4a65223f0f05bcefd31180 he wanted to sit down and was looking for a seat; he was walking along the k---- boulevard.
0x96e24c305b25695c5d758e3f75b256190a132a41 there was a seat about a hundred paces in front of him.
0xaabc6bbed89473e4e18d3ed87499de1c8d3975d7 he walked towards it as fast he could; but on the way he met with a little adventure which absorbed all his attention.
0xbf7a1cf346c7a98f45612215137663028e4148f0 looking for the seat, he had noticed a woman walking some twenty paces in front of him, but at first he took no more notice of her than of other objects that crossed his path.
0xb6b621284843750c516321b03853f5d814d0bb0a it had happened to him many times going home not to notice the road by which he was going, and he was accustomed to walk like that.
0xca9a5fe459c368300700db57e9a0c41fa9833521 but there was at first sight something so strange about the woman in front of him, that gradually his attention was riveted upon her, at first reluctantly and, as it were, resentfully, and then more and more intently.
0xcac99427a933631a57f35605b14af89497f8ebb1 he felt a sudden desire to find out what it was that was so strange about the woman.
0xb94683716d18c31660c77f65b8c81cb4ba3076ad in the first place, she appeared to be a girl quite young, and she was walking in the great heat bareheaded and with no parasol or gloves, waving her arms about in an absurd way.
0x0180834eda8edeeb39d0ec7909bca97f316f5f5d she had on a dress of some light silky material, but put on strangely awry, not properly hooked up, and torn open at the top of the skirt, close to the waist: a great piece was rent and hanging loose.
0x742f599712881f9f2fdebbff8e0358945dfbdf70 a little kerchief was flung about her bare throat, but lay slanting on one side.
0xf5ef9f4b5c2ce72cf8e68ce986ec4dd1a13b9a90 the girl was walking unsteadily, too, stumbling and staggering from side to side.
0x1c3cc14c61247581fe0aedda14d21559e97e500f she drew raskolnikov’s whole attention at last.
0x4bbb96c18726158aaeb2a2b0c9ddd5e0480fb754 he overtook the girl at the seat, but, on reaching it, she dropped down on it, in the corner; she let her head sink on the back of the seat and closed her eyes, apparently in extreme exhaustion.
0xbe9038314ba33b138eb8d6dc893628f243f0347c looking at her closely, he saw at once that she was completely drunk.
0xb70fa979d21fef45321b941754d1a515ec7b298f it was a strange and shocking sight.
0xa34ac6e9c54e7a8bc2a416db8681577c92064cbd he could hardly believe that he was not mistaken.
0x7149f15a2ee094ed5411f50ec021fb79b552e30e he saw before him the face of a quite young, fair-haired girl--sixteen, perhaps not more than fifteen, years old, pretty little face, but flushed and heavy looking and, as it were, swollen.
0x4dc655bcf1cdbf24590d8863c7333c7459c3db33 the girl seemed hardly to know what she was doing; she crossed one leg over the other, lifting it indecorously, and showed every sign of being unconscious that she was in the street.
0xdf7797f0b4c738c0b4b259099ed2fe525b9c67bf raskolnikov did not sit down, but he felt unwilling to leave her, and stood facing her in perplexity.
0x7d758fef883b1616ab45d7b16c6b7519287feee6 this boulevard was never much frequented; and now, at two o’clock, in the stifling heat, it was quite deserted.
0x15b07e45322a597a05617f463519f4d078950d5d and yet on the further side of the boulevard, about fifteen paces away, a gentleman was standing on the edge of the pavement.
0x8b24745d5cc19d73595039ac71b904a838c2be6e he, too, would apparently have liked to approach the girl with some object of his own.
0x177fdac57d83d5ea1998dfd2487728e478d4b2b4 he, too, had probably seen her in the distance and had followed her, but found raskolnikov in his way.
0x42f6283c7cbf46754ca14272456976925e212316 he looked angrily at him, though he tried to escape his notice, and stood impatiently biding his time, till the unwelcome man in rags should have moved away.
0xae623da2bef69ebf315afc047609af360b064ecd his intentions were unmistakable.
0x5375b99d438c3462321bdb137fdd2ea8688f5eed the gentleman was a plump, thickly-set man, about thirty, fashionably dressed, with a high colour, red lips and moustaches.
0x06d57cd006a8bb6114b99ba34064afa1307b9fee raskolnikov felt furious; he had a sudden longing to insult this fat dandy in some way.
0x1ee3fbef492ddaba187fcd8d36babe02b65ba720 he left the girl for a moment and walked towards the gentleman.
0x169ea84ba95b9114ebc909865c73a368b0d10ca9 “hey!
0x09c8769c4d2252e916610d1c1bfc66cb4dcc721e you svidrigaïlov!
0x9e3e2e53c6773babbdf741621db24efbbc11d765 what do you want here?”
0x4011dc82d02384f6352c93d3b740d98999b2ab9f he shouted, clenching his fists and laughing, spluttering with rage.
0xbf88212b1ff5a8b9eaea9de92afa0c41e4b69ed7 “what do you mean?”
0x92345ae7f89507b5afd3dab864e2cc9b114f0fc6 the gentleman asked sternly, scowling in haughty astonishment.
0x5a794794e7790892d480575e49d0ed87ce57863c “get away, that’s what i mean.”
0xe99dfbbea68d9ac91f95eea20b5d701397e399cb “how dare you, you low fellow!”
0x26e647672be726d0b6c95e6f296a09c1df367800 he raised his cane.
0x968c4a7f94c646c1e35d47ea4cd39917bcdf49f7 raskolnikov rushed at him with his fists, without reflecting that the stout gentleman was a match for two men like himself.
0x58cddc8132c7182210e1687edd30cc7e7b093a20 but at that instant someone seized him from behind, and a police constable stood between them.
0x139c8eef2ac48e2f5ff1ca323b96443c4018a83d “that’s enough, gentlemen, no fighting, please, in a public place.
0x3f61ec4e8d9dab2c9512cf43898a834869c26971 what do you want?
0x52dd2ea6b29649a2ae538e8b1b0d215538e66e82 who are you?”
0xbf0543f0bc4939bbdf7d47a4df9416df101d4d4d he asked raskolnikov sternly, noticing his rags.
0x87df7c4afee01b152c8bad3fb29ef6759ad39a95 raskolnikov looked at him intently.
0xa63eb14014bc14c1c4f220a83a1c4224ef196ec9 he had a straight-forward, sensible, soldierly face, with grey moustaches and whiskers.
0xacc3280ed1e7cc6ab421fcba09da94a28d34cff3 “you are just the man i want,” raskolnikov cried, catching at his arm.
0x65af94cee39a960dfd01469abfd9fc54c7a8a3ab “i am a student, raskolnikov.... you may as well know that too,” he added, addressing the gentleman, “come along, i have something to show you.”
0xa7ff246b3cac7f2dad203cd3a0018808ec52b493 and taking the policeman by the hand he drew him towards the seat.
0x79aac8376bd7f37699b56a18d931454652f03917 “look here, hopelessly drunk, and she has just come down the boulevard.
0x7682b541b7c07a8a813c7386f24702e433188363 there is no telling who and what she is, she does not look like a professional.
0xb747f5a9af9db43965c6637175c0378d522274b7 it’s more likely she has been given drink and deceived somewhere... for the first time... you understand?
0x540362e797b1c65820a3006a48a3819b389ebec9 and they’ve put her out into the street like that.
0xcd3e2d7b365170560654553e6e83a045692a6e70 look at the way her dress is torn, and the way it has been put on: she has been dressed by somebody, she has not dressed herself, and dressed by unpractised hands, by a man’s hands; that’s evident.
0xba7d35970d6381959606cb66c07759b177b5c2a7 and now look there: i don’t know that dandy with whom i was going to fight, i see him for the first time, but he, too, has seen her on the road, just now, drunk, not knowing what she is doing, and now he is very eager to get hold of her, to get her away somewhere while she is in this state... that’s certain, believe me, i am not wrong.
0x83883bf023aee6b60ad44e06f5cc432b143dc85c i saw him myself watching her and following her, but i prevented him, and he is just waiting for me to go away.
0x4bcecef73ec6ca78b2939478e3ee793010dd2af3 now he has walked away a little, and is standing still, pretending to make a cigarette.... think how can we keep her out of his hands, and how are we to get her home?”
0xee20a0d2e74965825ff08e56de932b89b452a6a0 the policeman saw it all in a flash.
0xb4805486f3cd314adc965293108731d073d3e1c4 the stout gentleman was easy to understand, he turned to consider the girl.
0x653b0292dd471a9f1327ee4ee398171cc3375822 the policeman bent over to examine her more closely, and his face worked with genuine compassion.
0x51dbbd604a407012f016cb96f552d0aefd9cdb9e “ah, what a pity!”
0xd582326199f0c30325796437582941535956f4bd he said, shaking his head--“why, she is quite a child!
0x2b1afde212f02f41395c679176afc65d8dfeac6a she has been deceived, you can see that at once.
0x968d70a30567877df7dc29564c9aca8986b444a1 listen, lady,” he began addressing her, “where do you live?”
0xa0cb1bd81a697f367b124cdee20a09a18aff6b7c the girl opened her weary and sleepy-looking eyes, gazed blankly at the speaker and waved her hand.
0x45a8622448272c0fccd4f6eb55816b72f9209af5 “here,” said raskolnikov feeling in his pocket and finding twenty copecks, “here, call a cab and tell him to drive her to her address.
0x5ffdbeb9b6063a00592dc2f5c76d911c3f9ab94a the only thing is to find out her address!”
0x6238adb50733e17ac8164a7a3d9b30eb2988b5ee “missy, missy!”
0xfaf741aa2d044c1d647d12457260d5ae8afa5426 the policeman began again, taking the money.
0x639306e60d164790b68d3338b181589c51d2d29e “i’ll fetch you a cab and take you home myself.
0x902bf846f8d53ac7ed442b65c07b47415d598057 where shall i take you, eh?
0xe3a9371340a61819e662f9ed2e3f59d55531f642 where do you live?”
0xe2581046c5b918d8673aae06d161456ea1e460b7 “go away!
0xf3ff1a6c92ab7630b1885ebb17ad03b98bf32755 they won’t let me alone,” the girl muttered, and once more waved her hand.
0x434bc84827b4c2a5f39f8eb8cae49cea7efc1219 “ach, ach, how shocking!
0x02554c84d3d81e0f61882a4111eb009bc7817241 it’s shameful, missy, it’s a shame!”
0x015fe6c1cda542449c510f9241fdfa4e9c66b879 he shook his head again, shocked, sympathetic and indignant.
0x38aff4eccd4c8f89f62392b6447cbdfb87e38c98 “it’s a difficult job,” the policeman said to raskolnikov, and as he did so, he looked him up and down in a rapid glance.
0x1de7e7ca80688cb9fb53fde5f2275609d94cd739 he, too, must have seemed a strange figure to him: dressed in rags and handing him money!
0x452ae7c246b10d93aac18cea90a5385d4aed95a9 “did you meet her far from here?”
0x4455e6f2dde1cdca0ff1f81668909e14ae8eee15 he asked him.
0x0623bbf55c3324b7a68ace5aaef002b800147d91 “i tell you she was walking in front of me, staggering, just here, in the boulevard.
0xf90a217e14343e27b35f8731d64ed1aaa5ab9b64 she only just reached the seat and sank down on it.”
0x6efa40d54f68b1d75ea096b6fdce27336f140ac4 “ah, the shameful things that are done in the world nowadays, god have mercy on us!
0x0c6be8e556e5422b9ee9c49835a2827570bac5fe an innocent creature like that, drunk already!
0x59e8acd6efc89d68a2633a92c393485db0350aa5 she has been deceived, that’s a sure thing.
0xef6d174cad2de92f80a74ab427dd567876a05629 see how her dress has been torn too.... ah, the vice one sees nowadays!
0xa636c76d46893856919da53c9556354535db3087 and as likely as not she belongs to gentlefolk too, poor ones maybe.... there are many like that nowadays.
0x6e3fc0d2065045ecbdced80f54c6a9f695ba06c2 she looks refined, too, as though she were a lady,” and he bent over her once more.
0xcd6689d469a08c583b7dfa215330d34e29129533 perhaps he had daughters growing up like that, “looking like ladies and refined” with pretensions to gentility and smartness.... “the chief thing is,” raskolnikov persisted, “to keep her out of this scoundrel’s hands!
0x25210d8b5c01a0befbded17b551ce2c212787d7b why should he outrage her!
0xe45b2a232d91f6bdde480da3028c4081af1c6e02 it’s as clear as day what he is after; ah, the brute, he is not moving off!”
0x16cf702decda1ab39996720709720fb593546495 raskolnikov spoke aloud and pointed to him.
0x5b11e9170911948dc18637f40fa736069b6d38a2 the gentleman heard him, and seemed about to fly into a rage again, but thought better of it, and confined himself to a contemptuous look.
0x54501663fae50904df1a002bc47c513633c3a622 he then walked slowly another ten paces away and again halted.
0x2edb0dade1d5f2f6cb3b1872ff480437b7866ca6 “keep her out of his hands we can,” said the constable thoughtfully, “if only she’d tell us where to take her, but as it is.... missy, hey, missy!”
0x3a84f3f85739cb93b61e7e2d3c80af40738750cf he bent over her once more.
0xbc31bbc562317043f498dab53fe17f84ec395f6d she opened her eyes fully all of a sudden, looked at him intently, as though realising something, got up from the seat and walked away in the direction from which she had come.
0x16715af4b770e660bbd3de3415ea85a447dc8301 “oh shameful wretches, they won’t let me alone!”
0xead160987c45bcdb7a0cad9f8cd412375401de17 she said, waving her hand again.
0x907ef3ec5306d42aa2b615037533caa524af754f she walked quickly, though staggering as before.
0x7407b6f34f0e778efa74a1a7717b16503b78ba84 the dandy followed her, but along another avenue, keeping his eye on her.
0x0c85216ae3565b3626d6a879a56e98478cc000fc “don’t be anxious, i won’t let him have her,” the policeman said resolutely, and he set off after them.
0x28cea7e5cd16442f6157960321c65a336492cb45 “ah, the vice one sees nowadays!”
0x784c24e2ef2a8f22bd292a9723c38e07e2bd9531 he repeated aloud, sighing.
0x7b12cf04de1a663eb274d944177143fca24691fe at that moment something seemed to sting raskolnikov; in an instant a complete revulsion of feeling came over him.
0xbc8dd23e9aba2b4172f42c805175be14a5739a78 “hey, here!”
0x081fa568df16a0e404d4a27ff04b08a13e1857e9 he shouted after the policeman.
0x487e1863ce4cf566d7f600909959f068a3b96e8e the latter turned round.
0x43d2abe88a51993be4afe3914a7f47d2bcafca05 “let them be!
0x70d83a9c41dc7eff4fcc2a9102569fa4151427b8 what is it to do with you?
0xace429e09f4e7c34f205788a1db81aadff9adef3 let her go!
0x57429b82291b9e4308c2f17cf45af2b20254fede let him amuse himself.”
0xb822d87add84849dce9d50cffb920d9117900162 he pointed at the dandy, “what is it to do with you?”
0x0a1381f54e6df32a922fb6d1908456e04afaadc0 the policeman was bewildered, and stared at him open-eyed.
0xd0ea4b5c5f135165682c546bca6b725157cff8a1 raskolnikov laughed.
0xe32bd0f51f8e55e25261b3fd3dc87f4455454d91 “well!”
0xd2bbab330dd05201530a938afe47a835520c180e ejaculated the policeman, with a gesture of contempt, and he walked after the dandy and the girl, probably taking raskolnikov for a madman or something even worse.
0x321e78f9d07f077a467b5087b01ed4e45663b6e9 “he has carried off my twenty copecks,” raskolnikov murmured angrily when he was left alone.
0xd2e9b9d8c18ce2a77257881963a5a0245557f6be “well, let him take as much from the other fellow to allow him to have the girl and so let it end.
0x9a6838096094fbe9ac14734b5d3a2b79c2e1f24c and why did i want to interfere?
0x17acb67ea0ba1a1ee55c58e9ca35daff602b1371 is it for me to help?
0xc150d06cda2a2517bd8e01ac1dba3b746d40f479 have i any right to help?
0x6ea88235144dafe2c50cabcdd5a14ff63cd4072b let them devour each other alive--what is it to me?
0xa9fe2d326ca7d6ae0ffa42a154be14b7e7e29b63 how did i dare to give him twenty copecks?
0x9fbe19db7eb8e5ce8ab5873029f624fc41825431 were they mine?”
0x19624180e4ca8bae8d1a6b0e4f7af3f6d26e650a in spite of those strange words he felt very wretched.
0x654ce79891ab9888e4198e4e3e239beaf4f58e18 he sat down on the deserted seat.
0xca6bbfcdc976e7bd660139b0d054944a6a434b47 his thoughts strayed aimlessly.... he found it hard to fix his mind on anything at that moment.
0xd551edc84748807d6097b79cbb26af94dfe8abf2 he longed to forget himself altogether, to forget everything, and then to wake up and begin life anew.... “poor girl!”
0x88c21e2fb8a8eab8ad19ebc5dfbc1779c1375ec8 he said, looking at the empty corner where she had sat--“she will come to herself and weep, and then her mother will find out.... she will give her a beating, a horrible, shameful beating and then maybe, turn her out of doors.... and even if she does not, the darya frantsovnas will get wind of it, and the girl will soon be slipping out on the sly here and there.
0xc3a5d8979dd46c3bca691fca1c068d271120e644 then there will be the hospital directly (that’s always the luck of those girls with respectable mothers, who go wrong on the sly) and then... again the hospital... drink... the taverns... and more hospital, in two or three years--a wreck, and her life over at eighteen or nineteen.... have not i seen cases like that?
0x517579be83b16c77e067450e29bcfca261dc561a and how have they been brought to it?
0x13284513317c2dbf1f72eb017aefd4607fc609c3 why, they’ve all come to it like that.
0xbd88adde2750fd0de0c2fa81d626022adc551584 ugh!
0x4df732a1d3ab904e3aa1ae02d46cdb9476548c24 but what does it matter?
0xf00e8a138258597f0cda9d07b48dc54ec28c0454 that’s as it should be, they tell us.
0x4038c8058d01e5fadc1307ff86da14202642d9bb a certain percentage, they tell us, must every year go... that way... to the devil, i suppose, so that the rest may remain chaste, and not be interfered with.
0x678eb9b37b804e9dda51b2dc1bc3ee946a48c53b a percentage!
0x433f87e3cce9bfb8db412c94c2517390628a7bf7 what splendid words they have; they are so scientific, so consolatory.... once you’ve said ‘percentage’ there’s nothing more to worry about.
0x489f5af4c1555e35bedebed983dcd8434fe0eb1f if we had any other word... maybe we might feel more uneasy.... but what if dounia were one of the percentage!
0x92f6d530d1ca32417b8da3e44e14fe8819640713 of another one if not that one?
0xa9bd55b1ee85ca29c0b82b794e0c821059d57478 “but where am i going?”
0xbeec616c295177e8e403dc1173685578ace6b4fe he thought suddenly.
0x9da0110980d25a1b160eba28871526362810a38c “strange, i came out for something.
0x44f18bf0193142efe27a290bd0aea964198d6be6 as soon as i had read the letter i came out.... i was going to vassilyevsky ostrov, to razumihin.
0x5053b5c95167870bff88c27e10b958f90733d9ae that’s what it was... now i remember.
0x238f85e12567788dc8c4d7e9ae6332d7629a6b9e what for, though?
0x47a04e9596d825dbd52003de83072322295d5910 and what put the idea of going to razumihin into my head just now?
0x8c98854e39af29aabef4d90509c710c668d78906 that’s curious.”
0xbf6e09306dff6ab87c2529e78aaa8a0a652f1557 he wondered at himself.
0x81f933ca6b21f419b750df1a1c22664e9b707802 razumihin was one of his old comrades at the university.
0x953fa8e6044e8ea245c0390dd6ff5788d7fd1c9c it was remarkable that raskolnikov had hardly any friends at the university; he kept aloof from everyone, went to see no one, and did not welcome anyone who came to see him, and indeed everyone soon gave him up.
0xc31f8783d00bb2ae3eb238f31a00100d6dc78fc4 he took no part in the students’ gatherings, amusements or conversations.
0xc0a628472418a576c6284db6d38239d4562b66fc he worked with great intensity without sparing himself, and he was respected for this, but no one liked him.
0xbad92a57e20417a90edbe5603d13d6ead8d7dc28 he was very poor, and there was a sort of haughty pride and reserve about him, as though he were keeping something to himself.
0xb97b822d0f4704f4a988cbcbb85ad07e1ac2f62e he seemed to some of his comrades to look down upon them all as children, as though he were superior in development, knowledge and convictions, as though their beliefs and interests were beneath him.
0x63174f30010efac4d5c5ba2b552f4ca9405b9d7e with razumihin he had got on, or, at least, he was more unreserved and communicative with him.
0xecfa5a6e2d8c33f90219161850338bc75fe8adad indeed it was impossible to be on any other terms with razumihin.
0x1dc253d8278fcb1b2069e5ff581b4d48099d1f37 he was an exceptionally good-humoured and candid youth, good-natured to the point of simplicity, though both depth and dignity lay concealed under that simplicity.
0x84cdecb2f1d8622dfd729e5e997fad4b47454cee the better of his comrades understood this, and all were fond of him.
0x966371904cc7151f0b44145e79ef7e947ebee8a3 he was extremely intelligent, though he was certainly rather a simpleton at times.
0xb0743f179ec14703fc9351f17f2adc480447796d he was of striking appearance--tall, thin, blackhaired and always badly shaved.
0x310550916ff3c66a4242799ffaac88e60cf49139 he was sometimes uproarious and was reputed to be of great physical strength.
0xfffd18f3290acae72483e79eeeecefe3c2512c06 one night, when out in a festive company, he had with one blow laid a gigantic policeman on his back.
0x5e7c502c2801f63f636d9f35e0ede36e5c2924f2 there was no limit to his drinking powers, but he could abstain from drink altogether; he sometimes went too far in his pranks; but he could do without pranks altogether.
0x8c2eab438597ec09cfbe6d25519996fc7e8efbd6 another thing striking about razumihin, no failure distressed him, and it seemed as though no unfavourable circumstances could crush him.
0xb8437077bfc39d9f2d7da22bd03ab766b006fc7f he could lodge anywhere, and bear the extremes of cold and hunger.
0xa8ccee4397741f01ca1d3fbe66f8434a07f83617 he was very poor, and kept himself entirely on what he could earn by work of one sort or another.
0x236f87d04a1d50b691f3ed77397304a6181595bb he knew of no end of resources by which to earn money.
0x50e6b1efde89a32c9a5dc2d4429f5116699b9cc7 he spent one whole winter without lighting his stove, and used to declare that he liked it better, because one slept more soundly in the cold.
0x79d40aeccb8b15825b1ad69b18602d74622f7df6 for the present he, too, had been obliged to give up the university, but it was only for a time, and he was working with all his might to save enough to return to his studies again.
0x379b2e5090e115dd46a50cc10b233ffbf54d5eef raskolnikov had not been to see him for the last four months, and razumihin did not even know his address.
0x23963a082734306235db4b2e3a2f23f5666d7d0e about two months before, they had met in the street, but raskolnikov had turned away and even crossed to the other side that he might not be observed.
0xf862163cffe7e8a978e18625d4febbb91d4c8938 and though razumihin noticed him, he passed him by, as he did not want to annoy him.
0xcca69972caa3422e6721713f71c20340dffcc36d chapter v “of course, i’ve been meaning lately to go to razumihin’s to ask for work, to ask him to get me lessons or something...” raskolnikov thought, “but what help can he be to me now?
0x5095e22987f3f5cdecc3200a65e39e5e887ebbc3 suppose he gets me lessons, suppose he shares his last farthing with me, if he has any farthings, so that i could get some boots and make myself tidy enough to give lessons... hm... well and what then?
0xceede5c62569f7ecb335d4ab3d0b4315c53f2443 what shall i do with the few coppers i earn?
0x1770f3952217cf73ee225a4adfa19091a748b254 that’s not what i want now.
0xe28fddf54605cb06825e61fef653eda64fa9ec67 it’s really absurd for me to go to razumihin....” the question why he was now going to razumihin agitated him even more than he was himself aware; he kept uneasily seeking for some sinister significance in this apparently ordinary action.
0x8c9671c3093e7acd85a81a0591c30df812ac6b27 “could i have expected to set it all straight and to find a way out by means of razumihin alone?”
0xa3fc425577b80229bfd91c1f267871c137151cdd he asked himself in perplexity.
0x42bfa6b4af1d7dddaf8801a8f1c46328627d4367 he pondered and rubbed his forehead, and, strange to say, after long musing, suddenly, as if it were spontaneously and by chance, a fantastic thought came into his head.
0xbd32a748419a8d2ccedc1ce060ab450993d27245 “hm... to razumihin’s,” he said all at once, calmly, as though he had reached a final determination.
0x3acfbb50281bf68972927e7563d31ad7ffc259e3 “i shall go to razumihin’s of course, but... not now.
0xaac5fd8b1538993d1178019689add19087df1a10 i shall go to him... on the next day after it, when it will be over and everything will begin afresh....” and suddenly he realised what he was thinking.
0xb50109677dfe00f358969721690801e9c79929f6 “after it,” he shouted, jumping up from the seat, “but is it really going to happen?
0xec2e33d0b8c0403e0804842d5fac633a2d23c139 is it possible it really will happen?”
0x9fae700b12babd03e9c9ab8b225fa1c678c5f9ca he left the seat, and went off almost at a run; he meant to turn back, homewards, but the thought of going home suddenly filled him with intense loathing; in that hole, in that awful little cupboard of his, all _this_ had for a month past been growing up in him; and he walked on at random.
0xc46a70d4f31b46a29d89d6abcb26f5711bcf5aa1 his nervous shudder had passed into a fever that made him feel shivering; in spite of the heat he felt cold.
0x850b4e0ae15ddad9421d4b3ba2e08ed9a8a1064f with a kind of effort he began almost unconsciously, from some inner craving, to stare at all the objects before him, as though looking for something to distract his attention; but he did not succeed, and kept dropping every moment into brooding.
0x436611386b29060c5dd6a28b0fc166a89e7f72ae when with a start he lifted his head again and looked round, he forgot at once what he had just been thinking about and even where he was going.
0x1846584ee351b15c6d414f13e8d768b635f827dc in this way he walked right across vassilyevsky ostrov, came out on to the lesser neva, crossed the bridge and turned towards the islands.
0x8ad8ddb96276e5802900834c3b3f6f4411ce3093 the greenness and freshness were at first restful to his weary eyes after the dust of the town and the huge houses that hemmed him in and weighed upon him.
0xe60e677e993ad087faeb9c65ffe915a4ba32d6fd here there were no taverns, no stifling closeness, no stench.
0x84900925550a1a45c23726400e7fc59fb5255941 but soon these new pleasant sensations passed into morbid irritability.
0x64afabc0d1277f2016c453827faeb142e690f1ac sometimes he stood still before a brightly painted summer villa standing among green foliage, he gazed through the fence, he saw in the distance smartly dressed women on the verandahs and balconies, and children running in the gardens.
0x99cb0fc7fb51d7da5af24c3a8972f9885fbb4ecc the flowers especially caught his attention; he gazed at them longer than at anything.
0x021f321cbf004945d3601a2a95a13ab8f179d3c0 he was met, too, by luxurious carriages and by men and women on horseback; he watched them with curious eyes and forgot about them before they had vanished from his sight.
0xf9427859e9d6b109e329d5457303e44590cecb89 once he stood still and counted his money; he found he had thirty copecks.
0x1f465f61ffcced1ccef8984a3aaeafe540104568 “twenty to the policeman, three to nastasya for the letter, so i must have given forty-seven or fifty to the marmeladovs yesterday,” he thought, reckoning it up for some unknown reason, but he soon forgot with what object he had taken the money out of his pocket.
0xd46298f875a78308076861932104ff81e9e62dfe he recalled it on passing an eating-house or tavern, and felt that he was hungry.... going into the tavern he drank a glass of vodka and ate a pie of some sort.
0xca7d1fa5b8bba007a6b6e73790e39565a001e41c he finished eating it as he walked away.
0x41915639b84b6db439d2f0afc13617eb521f756d it was a long while since he had taken vodka and it had an effect upon him at once, though he only drank a wineglassful.
0xc05e4523d5bb6617c38cc3fe3bd23e835f8d29d4 his legs felt suddenly heavy and a great drowsiness came upon him.
0xfaadcccb0e50b65e761174d38aade0a10aa96c05 he turned homewards, but reaching petrovsky ostrov he stopped completely exhausted, turned off the road into the bushes, sank down upon the grass and instantly fell asleep.
0xcf47e3c9aed5b0b44c680869d0b287e1597cfa7e in a morbid condition of the brain, dreams often have a singular actuality, vividness, and extraordinary semblance of reality.
0x6cc4a42dce67d7e371a9bf1c5337b07d714ab7c6 at times monstrous images are created, but the setting and the whole picture are so truth-like and filled with details so delicate, so unexpectedly, but so artistically consistent, that the dreamer, were he an artist like pushkin or turgenev even, could never have invented them in the waking state.
0xc9b623edc7cc78a1fccaa634ca812f6f56c1eeb6 such sick dreams always remain long in the memory and make a powerful impression on the overwrought and deranged nervous system.
0xbf7c6bf268e22117644c3a2e27f94cadc012538f raskolnikov had a fearful dream.
0xf6d17741d613d9d6b573f31597db0ed7519f7cc4 he dreamt he was back in his childhood in the little town of his birth.
0x0441f5c9f874d4538eadb26e19742ae7e2f9da9d he was a child about seven years old, walking into the country with his father on the evening of a holiday.
0x2a0207dd5a040b9090860b4573d7c6e39c98b8a5 it was a grey and heavy day, the country was exactly as he remembered it; indeed he recalled it far more vividly in his dream than he had done in memory.
0x373073e25bbf951cd6b890cfd8a7abb0b7a06c8c the little town stood on a level flat as bare as the hand, not even a willow near it; only in the far distance, a copse lay, a dark blur on the very edge of the horizon.
0x345e22b144335b4b732a101ac890eb112217221a a few paces beyond the last market garden stood a tavern, a big tavern, which had always aroused in him a feeling of aversion, even of fear, when he walked by it with his father.
0xd20cb09298d13533bb4334a207fa7c166ed1aea3 there was always a crowd there, always shouting, laughter and abuse, hideous hoarse singing and often fighting.
0x8e8d9faefbfed64ea104136b98ea0cf9ab4f18ec drunken and horrible-looking figures were hanging about the tavern.
0xbde8c7a9a8136ae3780343aa4f297332cad45799 he used to cling close to his father, trembling all over when he met them.
0xb5f5d0ed64562e61f518923d2531917ad306d8d9 near the tavern the road became a dusty track, the dust of which was always black.
0x0666657412647719ff69eac4e6bb5a8122918653 it was a winding road, and about a hundred paces further on, it turned to the right to the graveyard.
0xe430c3c25f3be6690b1475283cbca01edec724aa in the middle of the graveyard stood a stone church with a green cupola where he used to go to mass two or three times a year with his father and mother, when a service was held in memory of his grandmother, who had long been dead, and whom he had never seen.
0x090c63e2413c250151d8007ab4b6b95aba07be71 on these occasions they used to take on a white dish tied up in a table napkin a special sort of rice pudding with raisins stuck in it in the shape of a cross.
0x845ba8e8cad8602d1823d533514f732590ab5062 he loved that church, the old-fashioned, unadorned ikons and the old priest with the shaking head.
0x11ba8267a86daf28012b51867074a5ce95d3aff9 near his grandmother’s grave, which was marked by a stone, was the little grave of his younger brother who had died at six months old.
0x6df06e8a6c26b6ed540561db97494ef58c92c510 he did not remember him at all, but he had been told about his little brother, and whenever he visited the graveyard he used religiously and reverently to cross himself and to bow down and kiss the little grave.
0xe79f965038c0fd701ad4364fd69629265bd0341c and now he dreamt that he was walking with his father past the tavern on the way to the graveyard; he was holding his father’s hand and looking with dread at the tavern.
0xbc99cdb3094ff17fc6775b553826569ce7a48b79 a peculiar circumstance attracted his attention: there seemed to be some kind of festivity going on, there were crowds of gaily dressed townspeople, peasant women, their husbands, and riff-raff of all sorts, all singing and all more or less drunk.
0xdcc3bc986d6d45318f930989f9d0e783d1b74e48 near the entrance of the tavern stood a cart, but a strange cart.
0x933482e5da6fc07e84951d101eb608d708c06574 it was one of those big carts usually drawn by heavy cart-horses and laden with casks of wine or other heavy goods.
0x20409198b2eacb96452149e1ba181da58ebe67f6 he always liked looking at those great cart-horses, with their long manes, thick legs, and slow even pace, drawing along a perfect mountain with no appearance of effort, as though it were easier going with a load than without it.
0xa4d75512ed37731c88fdf5f39e0e0af5dc3cba84 but now, strange to say, in the shafts of such a cart he saw a thin little sorrel beast, one of those peasants’ nags which he had often seen straining their utmost under a heavy load of wood or hay, especially when the wheels were stuck in the mud or in a rut.
0x8ad62f27206e355847feb0d290931ffb5f04cad1 and the peasants would beat them so cruelly, sometimes even about the nose and eyes, and he felt so sorry, so sorry for them that he almost cried, and his mother always used to take him away from the window.
0x220b166aab307a2cfe9ad520a1cbf0d888857c5b all of a sudden there was a great uproar of shouting, singing and the balalaïka, and from the tavern a number of big and very drunken peasants came out, wearing red and blue shirts and coats thrown over their shoulders.
0xf26d4392a34c8520be4eb705eebde1b01557979b “get in, get in!”
0x5d5e1f70ebcd8f62f2df5aad4d293acb65dc9471 shouted one of them, a young thick-necked peasant with a fleshy face red as a carrot.
0x9522be3c8175309114c3a3f7b90b7e51d2254b30 “i’ll take you all, get in!”
0xa725234b2a628798651b777446346c4c597d2c0a but at once there was an outbreak of laughter and exclamations in the crowd.
0x975b6cf9afc8f20117c8c70cd96fd530cabb3b1b “take us all with a beast like that!”
0x6db50657978c2308965d1c9cbc0ce8a0f9c87184 “why, mikolka, are you crazy to put a nag like that in such a cart?”
0x198fc19fbedb8fcdddf342d942d612c39c180686 “and this mare is twenty if she is a day, mates!”
0x2ffb21671a08fbc621f973d155c0541c1c41d450 “get in, i’ll take you all,” mikolka shouted again, leaping first into the cart, seizing the reins and standing straight up in front.
0xe042168dab9752e03000510e84d8c301e9ff9178 “the bay has gone with matvey,” he shouted from the cart--“and this brute, mates, is just breaking my heart, i feel as if i could kill her.
0x24ed033e848fefc6962f048a00c244b488ee184a she’s just eating her head off.

0x103af707202de3108fecb3c4bcda575373d4696e i’ll make her gallop!
0x8bb9b1cde307e4f3dff20785458a94c190af2d5a she’ll gallop!”
0x8eb25e1c1b7588e8e5c7c9d0c27f2255b60f1ec7 and he picked up the whip, preparing himself with relish to flog the little mare.
0x796713cca7a44bbfb5250d269faaf643b6f9ee46 “get in!
0x3849d73a65e6a6c2c728a0dbe965f394d6194f0c come along!”
0x5a91b3c0c762641a4e3e4415f321652f5e671c79 the crowd laughed.
0x2b3916e03cc49810af6e510719961c221bda0995 “d’you hear, she’ll gallop!”
0x753ca723e1b332a40a796b71c0b25fa7ab948cf4 “gallop indeed!
0xa11b06aa4d5f3c38fe1fb111dc6d4edc2a09d914 she has not had a gallop in her for the last ten years!”
0xe26e8abe8ded9f4879680423ae6532e792124565 “she’ll jog along!”
0xdabc26d50449529b3485e467925d8b299de12c51 “don’t you mind her, mates, bring a whip each of you, get ready!”
0x5451f47a40cdcf916001df704f76f44f9107c041 “all right!
0xc94e25a3350f3ad29febe60dd7edf8059eb1856f give it to her!”
0x719e3891af6b813f7e2f7edba08fb6d6efffaae0 they all clambered into mikolka’s cart, laughing and making jokes.
0x77b40908d3d84536d40b57b9b9ea0f7ecd6379e7 six men got in and there was still room for more.
0xd1feda68fcf725811f8acf9c68def7275fad19d5 they hauled in a fat, rosy-cheeked woman.
0x72e109dbd960ec3149a338fee66c2535383e465d she was dressed in red cotton, in a pointed, beaded headdress and thick leather shoes; she was cracking nuts and laughing.
0xbbd3edd319193106fad39a9de46aa818bbedfe97 the crowd round them was laughing too and indeed, how could they help laughing?
0x6971b290e915aee3b3b4c4cdb93f6c460b03e10b that wretched nag was to drag all the cartload of them at a gallop!
0x41b03da840f5c8b31bfdee541ae196e0083f6457 two young fellows in the cart were just getting whips ready to help mikolka.
0x019d4c13ab5fcc9493ebf3b601b888313ab4b61d with the cry of “now,” the mare tugged with all her might, but far from galloping, could scarcely move forward; she struggled with her legs, gasping and shrinking from the blows of the three whips which were showered upon her like hail.
0x3ccaf78d0bc2f0192b7b98ccc8a2fdb92173d138 the laughter in the cart and in the crowd was redoubled, but mikolka flew into a rage and furiously thrashed the mare, as though he supposed she really could gallop.
0x743536843baf563497fb94e62157c5b7d5f7e07b “let me get in, too, mates,” shouted a young man in the crowd whose appetite was aroused.
0xbc19416f15256aa64ecc13601767d70744d08811 “get in, all get in,” cried mikolka, “she will draw you all.
0x329abb49a724039589658cf3291fd4382ad5cba8 i’ll beat her to death!”
0x4d9b72cedd5566319781c46193d17ce8d586a1cf and he thrashed and thrashed at the mare, beside himself with fury.
0x31777eb61fda0534634911a25187e1655909eded “father, father,” he cried, “father, what are they doing?
0x7291a5fc6f08e8935ec07dfab222c707ccee966a father, they are beating the poor horse!”
0x359fd1b8cde8dd192326fbf0d36863876bd57912 “come along, come along!”
0x00300d2b3c084843885294ead4d7da9a22f41aed said his father.
0x362cb556d0c7778770f72f2a54d9493d74a94d32 “they are drunken and foolish, they are in fun; come away, don’t look!”
0x75d0c18842f7c0ebbb8b9dce5b095923743fa978 and he tried to draw him away, but he tore himself away from his hand, and, beside himself with horror, ran to the horse.
0xa04a3f45f7d171f8866cae14881e833350dc020d the poor beast was in a bad way.
0xd7b2d747d1cbb175f42352e1c3c449bed2f32e2e she was gasping, standing still, then tugging again and almost falling.
0xa7a997afb6c07798ea67ae5e023efd2ef43a6c09 “beat her to death,” cried mikolka, “it’s come to that.
0xfd6bd039f750db47a6ed5c08fab66dd20f249a14 i’ll do for her!”
0x4c9f60010eafef9ae992b394e778d795892785dd “what are you about, are you a christian, you devil?”
0xe8ec464a311b2fbb6a90db99cb5102788f781af0 shouted an old man in the crowd.
0x7e3ccefd55ae97fcd8bcc8c036c8fe5470c27b09 “did anyone ever see the like?
0x2414de1fe6679d60d813d701304d27c30798c40d a wretched nag like that pulling such a cartload,” said another.
0x83f6fa36330e0704b84582f52e58ea04565a46e1 “you’ll kill her,” shouted the third.
0xf30f448bcba6fd416ac510c8112e160ca882482d “don’t meddle!

0xab1a5c4c48eb69dfbe785eab43f19ec92fc8312f all at once laughter broke into a roar and covered everything: the mare, roused by the shower of blows, began feebly kicking.
0x575718f8c4bee3233f23c512aa38801399133585 even the old man could not help smiling.
0xe4f3f7089e79fb217fcdfef50f3c3079339d8167 to think of a wretched little beast like that trying to kick!
0xc7f54200a71cd0e3227e84adf7e18d59e4b66149 two lads in the crowd snatched up whips and ran to the mare to beat her about the ribs.
0x29c389e34b1fdaaf4e59fb5b36e4416c97e3ee4e one ran each side.
0x09c6fa35a518bdf5c381e7ac8cdfad7662914b38 “hit her in the face, in the eyes, in the eyes,” cried mikolka.
0x942fc4875b8a968df7f5c03c8fb8debf45f8d06c “give us a song, mates,” shouted someone in the cart and everyone in the cart joined in a riotous song, jingling a tambourine and whistling.
0x35abc2e7650c0ece743a169d563d208f683a3079 the woman went on cracking nuts and laughing.
0x54bf1a58dcefcdcd6bceae47cc683a16205a8c7b ... he ran beside the mare, ran in front of her, saw her being whipped across the eyes, right in the eyes!
0x24ab0d5f4fa530a0028edada93b806f37d6f8c32 he was crying, he felt choking, his tears were streaming.
0xc37c2ca663d0944ac65da465b3a69452b1b40792 one of the men gave him a cut with the whip across the face, he did not feel it.
0x1bd2a6d5a0ceb45f3167833b572d99dc48e729ee wringing his hands and screaming, he rushed up to the grey-headed old man with the grey beard, who was shaking his head in disapproval.
0xc344cd32e48d41b3ebc45bff930166533aa26b1d one woman seized him by the hand and would have taken him away, but he tore himself from her and ran back to the mare.
0x07bfa5607dff5e3ed912418f35a18d9220786fc8 she was almost at the last gasp, but began kicking once more.
0x0bd5ba9ed6a03c58252791e74d28b0267d92c254 “i’ll teach you to kick,” mikolka shouted ferociously.
0x134865a536ad6761644b230fd6904bc3754d458e he threw down the whip, bent forward and picked up from the bottom of the cart a long, thick shaft, he took hold of one end with both hands and with an effort brandished it over the mare.
0xa93f387c6591a051dbde28b1166f151585c17ec9 “he’ll crush her,” was shouted round him.
0xb1cbb6c1b56c8b330d53756c256d669bef3f3e43 “he’ll kill her!”
0xe0f94e2fe5147d533701ad26058d57c060cc9f63 “it’s my property,” shouted mikolka and brought the shaft down with a swinging blow.
0x2905a5c53c11317b8991aed437cd8635ac9049e0 there was a sound of a heavy thud.
0xe7e82fce341e4c47dc37b8fee8f7903cec016621 “thrash her, thrash her!

0xf8f6f6967fa32de0fae30c227f8c379b8411096d shouted voices in the crowd.
0xf7499bcd84ac38cd7ee3f88e787a7109c39a00a5 and mikolka swung the shaft a second time and it fell a second time on the spine of the luckless mare.
0xe3fb4c260e366c3d0eb236ba3ed317664505b045 she sank back on her haunches, but lurched forward and tugged forward with all her force, tugged first on one side and then on the other, trying to move the cart.
0x084c12e078d8ca53ba192e529ac81e92c76f2ce1 but the six whips were attacking her in all directions, and the shaft was raised again and fell upon her a third time, then a fourth, with heavy measured blows.
0xc13527e1b04eda26757d93e7b3b3c5d87b871bb6 mikolka was in a fury that he could not kill her at one blow.
0x428ded693c5f16a7d4d7b057a178d95be755308e “she’s a tough one,” was shouted in the crowd.

0xb5b92bd1b6e3f23e7e4005a8fe6bfd1c20f8fdc9 “look out,” he shouted, and with all his might he dealt a stunning blow at the poor mare.
0xc0cce88e6c50d0c10c8e8e9fd13fdd5f4b7c623b the blow fell; the mare staggered, sank back, tried to pull, but the bar fell again with a swinging blow on her back and she fell on the ground like a log.
0xbcb8c402de62af0b8732cc66c0087997b6beaaf4 “finish her off,” shouted mikolka and he leapt beside himself, out of the cart.

0x29d35bddd2b04925ce11e7c1b3a198f127b2a547 shouted mikolka, with bloodshot eyes, brandishing the bar in his hands.
0xd0773d50a44c15042a1579bcd427149b8176dd03 he stood as though regretting that he had nothing more to beat.
0x4453d90907788b5509c50f3ab6283eb2d86c8c88 “no mistake about it, you are not a christian,” many voices were shouting in the crowd.
0x05450bbb16e41dc9ea953ca25c7a4df2b77c724f but the poor boy, beside himself, made his way, screaming, through the crowd to the sorrel nag, put his arms round her bleeding dead head and kissed it, kissed the eyes and kissed the lips.... then he jumped up and flew in a frenzy with his little fists out at mikolka.
0x4bd2cad6eb412929f17fd68af68bb2c68591e2ba at that instant his father, who had been running after him, snatched him up and carried him out of the crowd.
0x713a5b451c274a6544192441fa1bc7099e6721b6 “come along, come!

0x13bb84d98b6562c958c6a0b24e6da40c5c785e5e he sobbed, but his voice broke and the words came in shrieks from his panting chest.
0xc8196cf5e33aba5bff33de49b9999fa9a82289da “they are drunk.... they are brutal... it’s not our business!”
0x00300d2b3c084843885294ead4d7da9a22f41aed said his father.
0xb12f359f6363a85b1f356f962a8e8fd3330c35ee he put his arms round his father but he felt choked, choked.
0x496bf9a7ed184b4cc2aff1377bec4343b588efdc he tried to draw a breath, to cry out--and woke up.
0xa0c25d24a6f7db60aba1830550da0fa09aef46df he waked up, gasping for breath, his hair soaked with perspiration, and stood up in terror.
0x00d483c5ba6606138bc601495146dd92c2e5c9ac “thank god, that was only a dream,” he said, sitting down under a tree and drawing deep breaths.

0xa42a642298ca571721332e9d458df699826d5094 such a hideous dream!”
0xe5f25dec96e091fc644cfff038c60ead217a95c5 he felt utterly broken: darkness and confusion were in his soul.
0x14a160ff44bfa02eaa51ce39b4bd6fe43c373f86 he rested his elbows on his knees and leaned his head on his hands.
0x6acf8b95b0d7967bfa0db2077e2289bde77e5a74 “good god!”
0xf1e38c0dcc33c0ae9d745550a0c1568629ec916d he cried, “can it be, can it be, that i shall really take an axe, that i shall strike her on the head, split her skull open... that i shall tread in the sticky warm blood, break the lock, steal and tremble; hide, all spattered in the blood... with the axe.... good god, can it be?”
0x5cd508a9510a4b497afec22cc8f026efb4c602e9 he was shaking like a leaf as he said this.
0xf8e110070cf10c65b5cf616be04df7b31a454c5c “but why am i going on like this?”
0x936b3104188b698eeddcf546cf3e9eac2489d4d6 he continued, sitting up again, as it were in profound amazement.
0x4e764f8a5af196f40681bf898b7c8c5638458949 “i knew that i could never bring myself to it, so what have i been torturing myself for till now?
0xf1ca404ff276aab78925ce3553082626f03a45dc yesterday, yesterday, when i went to make that... _experiment_, yesterday i realised completely that i could never bear to do it.... why am i going over it again, then?
0x620f93e53c32b4897f2da08af7cfdb343d02136b why am i hesitating?
0x28a517991ca39f459e1b01f5a595a2966ecc611e as i came down the stairs yesterday, i said myself that it was base, loathsome, vile, vile... the very thought of it made me feel sick and filled me with horror.
0xc631b21571679024074494c4b215bf727628a2bf “no, i couldn’t do it, i couldn’t do it!

0x9d565f2103dad2703bd8b8d60f5fa73b838472a2 why, why then am i still...?” he rose to his feet, looked round in wonder as though surprised at finding himself in this place, and went towards the bridge.
0xb6ef37c6efd6509447c4357635cb63c03d2a45c2 he was pale, his eyes glowed, he was exhausted in every limb, but he seemed suddenly to breathe more easily.
0xd337d945bf8fdc22bd1bbf568b0911f4620484f8 he felt he had cast off that fearful burden that had so long been weighing upon him, and all at once there was a sense of relief and peace in his soul.
0x16d7d18abd06e6887a253be68aa799614c4c1390 “lord,” he prayed, “show me my path--i renounce that accursed... dream of mine.”
0x038af69f671b351e985b151a0a1739db0c45b1fc crossing the bridge, he gazed quietly and calmly at the neva, at the glowing red sun setting in the glowing sky.
0xecce13f701378c25a63c3fa6359429c0393bb24d in spite of his weakness he was not conscious of fatigue.
0xa66f6642fb778cec07ef69483ffa1c0305c89482 it was as though an abscess that had been forming for a month past in his heart had suddenly broken.
0x1d6aaeac43667a82bfa26ea555fe98967b050a32 freedom, freedom!
0x7a2235c7e4cd9864cd2add96af05ad314f3cb991 he was free from that spell, that sorcery, that obsession!
0x112756ab56eafea89e59f352e9cdfd15717c6fba later on, when he recalled that time and all that happened to him during those days, minute by minute, point by point, he was superstitiously impressed by one circumstance, which, though in itself not very exceptional, always seemed to him afterwards the predestined turning-point of his fate.
0xe36d6b90f7caee393a826a455f82611a626f2de1 he could never understand and explain to himself why, when he was tired and worn out, when it would have been more convenient for him to go home by the shortest and most direct way, he had returned by the hay market where he had no need to go.
0x2fa88953fc3767c82a70f564094883b420c204c9 it was obviously and quite unnecessarily out of his way, though not much so.
0xbb6add2848b34015ccc198740b89635d71652e1e it is true that it happened to him dozens of times to return home without noticing what streets he passed through.
0x99280aab1fc54434ad40faf01f14d2adddc7b299 but why, he was always asking himself, why had such an important, such a decisive and at the same time such an absolutely chance meeting happened in the hay market (where he had moreover no reason to go) at the very hour, the very minute of his life when he was just in the very mood and in the very circumstances in which that meeting was able to exert the gravest and most decisive influence on his whole destiny?
0xbdde602409d8959b5d103a07e2d8a8bed0632a40 as though it had been lying in wait for him on purpose!
0x8ad437f5d6977a486239a24d8423e4cc6118ef10 it was about nine o’clock when he crossed the hay market.
0x7f33d072b5b0c9583ee049a2d084165d797a3e0b at the tables and the barrows, at the booths and the shops, all the market people were closing their establishments or clearing away and packing up their wares and, like their customers, were going home.
0x1e341a2a73a8ef6cae3caa849692fcc01a2fb7fa rag pickers and costermongers of all kinds were crowding round the taverns in the dirty and stinking courtyards of the hay market.
0x15d341acf399430ef54d917149cbba6b88c8f0e3 raskolnikov particularly liked this place and the neighbouring alleys, when he wandered aimlessly in the streets.
0xb926f594a821351da94d546cfa791d691178e604 here his rags did not attract contemptuous attention, and one could walk about in any attire without scandalising people.
0x1a16f3de0b3f9aaf83212c53375099fc8738e1ad at the corner of an alley a huckster and his wife had two tables set out with tapes, thread, cotton handkerchiefs, etc.
0x52aba0b674b3fd6ee3d8632552b38359d151c977 they, too, had got up to go home, but were lingering in conversation with a friend, who had just come up to them.
0x18cc2d15cd6ffdabebb5880b45740800ae706f2d this friend was lizaveta ivanovna, or, as everyone called her, lizaveta, the younger sister of the old pawnbroker, alyona ivanovna, whom raskolnikov had visited the previous day to pawn his watch and make his _experiment_.... he already knew all about lizaveta and she knew him a little too.
0xc524781afe4edab1f0c3e0d58dc0dc6a9d890614 she was a single woman of about thirty-five, tall, clumsy, timid, submissive and almost idiotic.
0x0393c27cf9685934b12411551d066aeab43f3cb7 she was a complete slave and went in fear and trembling of her sister, who made her work day and night, and even beat her.
0x870d2d7ad32bcf0d29308947200db205e893aa62 she was standing with a bundle before the huckster and his wife, listening earnestly and doubtfully.
0x4563921456156b244a1dd6a0e230f653af7a874e they were talking of something with special warmth.
0x1898a7b536de4883a3e43fe08ff16fc365348be5 the moment raskolnikov caught sight of her, he was overcome by a strange sensation as it were of intense astonishment, though there was nothing astonishing about this meeting.
0xf8b6d17089a03728acde44502344f7bb012b03ab “you could make up your mind for yourself, lizaveta ivanovna,” the huckster was saying aloud.
0x22fef59453ef095c0a2316758a499001d2f6cb38 “come round to-morrow about seven.
0x4ecd587233e662001c9e097702fb855ae702391a they will be here too.”
0x69718d58a616f79096734a067af3f72718dd6b5c “to-morrow?”
0xe2d52042a0b6685cc5ff3d64749d7f29d908ba69 said lizaveta slowly and thoughtfully, as though unable to make up her mind.
0x54778e5168da14fc4d1efad75705c70a99b02533 “upon my word, what a fright you are in of alyona ivanovna,” gabbled the huckster’s wife, a lively little woman.
0x059294c3a2a695a2ad053eac267ca7489ee8c221 “i look at you, you are like some little babe.
0x44ca33dc5eae319d723982316e94dcc310094e0a and she is not your own sister either--nothing but a step-sister and what a hand she keeps over you!”
0xb8dc9acbdf9082091d91ef3c4a6045699022d148 “but this time don’t say a word to alyona ivanovna,” her husband interrupted; “that’s my advice, but come round to us without asking.
0x3aa617a412456cc2222fe390d12583c9bd57016f it will be worth your while.
0x4e0f8c3cfe0a3ea250c2eda4ad44faee3611e7da later on your sister herself may have a notion.”
0xfe0e4d6ae6d0a5333c337772f9ba640cd25d360d “am i to come?”
0xa3141871a6a2bd54ca6b8bc87b1e22890757a914 “about seven o’clock to-morrow.
0xa940bd7428888c884df492af9a7a285c629d5425 and they will be here.
0x50d0053d77c8c63a5e442e05f24494796a0309a0 you will be able to decide for yourself.”
0x26cffd3d639afc81eaa27dd4bf8368cb0b090dbe “and we’ll have a cup of tea,” added his wife.
0x8167b1b9d3390196f78cff4350bf57adb1a8641c “all right, i’ll come,” said lizaveta, still pondering, and she began slowly moving away.
0xabfe694d55f09dc2fee9c23f99b22c3bf4162d55 raskolnikov had just passed and heard no more.
0xf3798436d111c30319645873e3b00d5bf5b0871f he passed softly, unnoticed, trying not to miss a word.
0x7a1957d8ba13b519d55b0d53259b39e7e9a9bc70 his first amazement was followed by a thrill of horror, like a shiver running down his spine.
0x1fdcf066b2d9f363166b9966f9c5d998b3d82455 he had learnt, he had suddenly quite unexpectedly learnt, that the next day at seven o’clock lizaveta, the old woman’s sister and only companion, would be away from home and that therefore at seven o’clock precisely the old woman _would be left alone_.
0x5a57d4cae58dbcc8c69b04cea3fc454c6e012149 he was only a few steps from his lodging.
0x992fd82eb6880c72c9f9ed6c352060dfddf5e05e he went in like a man condemned to death.
0x82cdedf0cee55a0ca4ddc634fc56894883822ef9 he thought of nothing and was incapable of thinking; but he felt suddenly in his whole being that he had no more freedom of thought, no will, and that everything was suddenly and irrevocably decided.
0x6c911cf063e6b1e5987767933925741578a32600 certainly, if he had to wait whole years for a suitable opportunity, he could not reckon on a more certain step towards the success of the plan than that which had just presented itself.
0xe4f0fa429322614bfe638c569f8a5abb7faa1946 in any case, it would have been difficult to find out beforehand and with certainty, with greater exactness and less risk, and without dangerous inquiries and investigations, that next day at a certain time an old woman, on whose life an attempt was contemplated, would be at home and entirely alone.
0x6b9a6ac3c6ed6e7f4839f1885d9dc5c5ea7f7218 chapter vi later on raskolnikov happened to find out why the huckster and his wife had invited lizaveta.
0xbafb4440349c84877989c8e3cb62ae15f66f1a7f it was a very ordinary matter and there was nothing exceptional about it.
0x14ac83bf2f26f484b5773b0f9b59fc2ab1bd8ae2 a family who had come to the town and been reduced to poverty were selling their household goods and clothes, all women’s things.
0x3380a72ff2011cb6b5ca916729d7bbfaaf82219f as the things would have fetched little in the market, they were looking for a dealer.
0x720ddc7af05a716ea82244d936c617b61a4fdff7 this was lizaveta’s business.
0x8b2061659373d5cbbb33e53e94aa78a0534bb82f she undertook such jobs and was frequently employed, as she was very honest and always fixed a fair price and stuck to it.
0xf00c8113582ebafae819217d85e166050f1f2aee she spoke as a rule little and, as we have said already, she was very submissive and timid.
0x92e5b62ab8275cf49aaccb5124a5bd7f382e3a7f but raskolnikov had become superstitious of late.
0xb064bb9021500df55746c39c41077e8208aa6678 the traces of superstition remained in him long after, and were almost ineradicable.
0x29e816bdc55de4c15ee88392b02c3c1ac97625a8 and in all this he was always afterwards disposed to see something strange and mysterious, as it were, the presence of some peculiar influences and coincidences.
0x1f7276902a86a3b76581495beff1860c8075ce4b in the previous winter a student he knew called pokorev, who had left for harkov, had chanced in conversation to give him the address of alyona ivanovna, the old pawnbroker, in case he might want to pawn anything.
0xc64b516d0d207b9258853616c57d4f0987cd136f for a long while he did not go to her, for he had lessons and managed to get along somehow.
0x3d5eaddb553570128a680e3b535d580a62ab5b93 six weeks ago he had remembered the address; he had two articles that could be pawned: his father’s old silver watch and a little gold ring with three red stones, a present from his sister at parting.
0x62cd1e860bf12ed8e98708381a7e73a2e9f83193 he decided to take the ring.
0x864b34b46a5fadf8b3fdfad15987fdd899844852 when he found the old woman he had felt an insurmountable repulsion for her at the first glance, though he knew nothing special about her.
0x9b237b27733fba411ddfe46e0dd37cb69fbaee6a he got two roubles from her and went into a miserable little tavern on his way home.
0x56ec41ec37754998d4ca5168a1ebb5200ea6ebc7 he asked for tea, sat down and sank into deep thought.
0x91d5a896b0e14d01e024a76035d897eb70089b9e a strange idea was pecking at his brain like a chicken in the egg, and very, very much absorbed him.
0x5a665deb5615bee074f302516a540c4e77a636b8 almost beside him at the next table there was sitting a student, whom he did not know and had never seen, and with him a young officer.
0xbcf03a8b81bef660df5d6923d3851576069f5361 they had played a game of billiards and began drinking tea.
0xe7097567ea32926e9111f794a7eb8d11a70e129a all at once he heard the student mention to the officer the pawnbroker alyona ivanovna and give him her address.
0xe6fd71a574c58e16ac64c87b6fab03f71f33d539 this of itself seemed strange to raskolnikov; he had just come from her and here at once he heard her name.
0x6ce78c6773daa54b4c0023a17b17e5f1d01a8fc0 of course it was a chance, but he could not shake off a very extraordinary impression, and here someone seemed to be speaking expressly for him; the student began telling his friend various details about alyona ivanovna.
0xf29cd5a43d11e0d5ac7590d6287ed42ddb8c2d16 “she is first-rate,” he said.
0xf34cd0aee926f991f593c768e5b1f4b39b8b7786 “you can always get money from her.
0xae0fba7022ce38356bb37b4b07224f9a086da09c she is as rich as a jew, she can give you five thousand roubles at a time and she is not above taking a pledge for a rouble.
0x99bc4bc5c87c17d1132f5c00909cb8d25c63e90f lots of our fellows have had dealings with her.
0xeb1bf439b10c84c876df09e0e01a16c2b8fd28b8 but she is an awful old harpy....” and he began describing how spiteful and uncertain she was, how if you were only a day late with your interest the pledge was lost; how she gave a quarter of the value of an article and took five and even seven percent a month on it and so on.
0xe9dcb9039e70269e076288d82eed6bb50be4de10 the student chattered on, saying that she had a sister lizaveta, whom the wretched little creature was continually beating, and kept in complete bondage like a small child, though lizaveta was at least six feet high.
0x8fd6e6df8c928bb045a425d270df2e94ddc542be “there’s a phenomenon for you,” cried the student and he laughed.
0x7df6afda1c7b6dd1211f375a7437b74b1c0005d1 they began talking about lizaveta.
0xcdd350f3f408fad21491b6a005aec7a8f8151527 the student spoke about her with a peculiar relish and was continually laughing and the officer listened with great interest and asked him to send lizaveta to do some mending for him.
0xe249dd17721794ac151d91e46297a23744d42f38 raskolnikov did not miss a word and learned everything about her.
0xdc80084e6606c0578a4e2e9f4ca4710cd9f56e2b lizaveta was younger than the old woman and was her half-sister, being the child of a different mother.
0xc89c3b1c6d4084d70a60bad43927540f63ba1489 she was thirty-five.
0x024284fecd288bb9ae99073cc802431d7aed438d she worked day and night for her sister, and besides doing the cooking and the washing, she did sewing and worked as a charwoman and gave her sister all she earned.
0xf81f3ca4fddfc6a769f8245c6b614b7733877d3c she did not dare to accept an order or job of any kind without her sister’s permission.
0x7aef9efd032ff23c44a2d7ee2ef13c94d4cf6f5a the old woman had already made her will, and lizaveta knew of it, and by this will she would not get a farthing; nothing but the movables, chairs and so on; all the money was left to a monastery in the province of n----, that prayers might be said for her in perpetuity.
0xf5f55c84d6cc291dd02d8f806e0dcec07fe6a226 lizaveta was of lower rank than her sister, unmarried and awfully uncouth in appearance, remarkably tall with long feet that looked as if they were bent outwards.
0x1d46b3dcb2d82e06166665073a6298660cc203bc she always wore battered goatskin shoes, and was clean in her person.
0xc87a7451ea3df62b23ca9cc22d6a8b28fe868273 what the student expressed most surprise and amusement about was the fact that lizaveta was continually with child.
0x1fa16d70a886297550cd736c0820d2fbc6be4d1d “but you say she is hideous?”
0x05c9b61dcc43d85213a96e9a0a96ecfe53151c3f observed the officer.
0x7f1b26ebb3c6eed15a6e03df2e18021572315a93 “yes, she is so dark-skinned and looks like a soldier dressed up, but you know she is not at all hideous.
0x0de8b9c9a28b326425c2e75e3c9b01248c37cbd9 she has such a good-natured face and eyes.
0x2fa22221673f760bea1ed49246c2f608916ef72d strikingly so.
0x86dcf1bbb0b165c6c2228421f63b13aac87871fe and the proof of it is that lots of people are attracted by her.
0xd7c5fd4ba8f10ce43b937ebcc8877e7427a35eb5 she is such a soft, gentle creature, ready to put up with anything, always willing, willing to do anything.
0xdc935f1d71e846decdd546342152730d187ae000 and her smile is really very sweet.”
0x69d1848fe88fac7df293f2e42beeb03548bfdf5d “you seem to find her attractive yourself,” laughed the officer.
0x73fd93c368f8c2c18d1f3c563762f5553b4272d1 “from her queerness.
0xe929dbe19cf9b96b61bd2bc8b34868d550baf7c2 no, i’ll tell you what.
0x49491c1750e01d292ba6a3163bc7e9b896966f59 i could kill that damned old woman and make off with her money, i assure you, without the faintest conscience-prick,” the student added with warmth.
0xed065cf5e66ba230932fd7f994dae76c96cd6059 the officer laughed again while raskolnikov shuddered.
0x7a0370896dcb9f785d6362a2666ecaaa6d05881d how strange it was!
0x925aed2b59a9a6f235a6d8a6048b4a4366224ac5 “listen, i want to ask you a serious question,” the student said hotly.
0xdfbe04a56189d6f4b6f72294ef8f35cfefd5ee16 “i was joking of course, but look here; on one side we have a stupid, senseless, worthless, spiteful, ailing, horrid old woman, not simply useless but doing actual mischief, who has not an idea what she is living for herself, and who will die in a day or two in any case.
0xba5d06563e5bbd21f4f21fd30dc2a388510e116f you understand?
0x31587d03fecbe7c5129a5850cdb81d1c617af35e you understand?”
0x3428ec5081dccd14d612f631906305dc54937f19 “yes, yes, i understand,” answered the officer, watching his excited companion attentively.
0x02484a0045f5e9918af022382525af18f056739d “well, listen then.
0x89ded5943fcf489469c2fbf7f04830e0559ee96a on the other side, fresh young lives thrown away for want of help and by thousands, on every side!
0xe03f21a536545fec99f0147c27c59c12f5289fc7 a hundred thousand good deeds could be done and helped, on that old woman’s money which will be buried in a monastery!
0x5691d9e42521837c72fdee529a5ccc61e88d833f hundreds, thousands perhaps, might be set on the right path; dozens of families saved from destitution, from ruin, from vice, from the lock hospitals--and all with her money.
0xb8ca32f97baf75f30d8ea8d8e6eb07e0341aab1b kill her, take her money and with the help of it devote oneself to the service of humanity and the good of all.
0x229c232d0301a3c30dc69c4887955c1eb03dc604 what do you think, would not one tiny crime be wiped out by thousands of good deeds?
0xa89919ec5ca97f3d6f6cd6c84b8132c75951d7e0 for one life thousands would be saved from corruption and decay.
0x5665530ad2df1a43750c92b2531fee336d19d117 one death, and a hundred lives in exchange--it’s simple arithmetic!
0x6a662ac450c107525f915e1869b6212de5b8392f besides, what value has the life of that sickly, stupid, ill-natured old woman in the balance of existence!
0x140de4cb98ac582e28fff1ed08006f8f3023c255 no more than the life of a louse, of a black-beetle, less in fact because the old woman is doing harm.
0xdcaaf1938a76842591310b9a8527e16fa841af9a she is wearing out the lives of others; the other day she bit lizaveta’s finger out of spite; it almost had to be amputated.”
0x5bfd4d584443363c969eecc3d8cbedc2c2909e51 “of course she does not deserve to live,” remarked the officer, “but there it is, it’s nature.”
0x1c1e7da5ebe0ab7f877aeefa81746c9c4c0018ba “oh, well, brother, but we have to correct and direct nature, and, but for that, we should drown in an ocean of prejudice.
0xbef31e921295ed4479bca9405e3017f236bac216 but for that, there would never have been a single great man.
0xe1b898ec9bd62eab646272c8060b0ef0ce30a9ba they talk of duty, conscience--i don’t want to say anything against duty and conscience;--but the point is, what do we mean by them?
0x027430f601031c956a3afa94f0403282aa75d58a stay, i have another question to ask you.
0xbfa9fc5fedb068805b97990568eea083ad521dd5 listen!”
0x4bb934cc473d783c93d1e2e29f39dac3b222b66d “no, you stay, i’ll ask you a question.
0xbfa9fc5fedb068805b97990568eea083ad521dd5 listen!”
0xeb72f99e0fb55a4aab85ee2cbbbf005118624953 “well?”
0x67a766da05b639611d4d4d207d9164dd5a389dbe “you are talking and speechifying away, but tell me, would you kill the old woman _yourself_?”
0x6d9f40e757dd97d90a6d938431551ae7d5881ba5 “of course not!
0x1d3b379e98e0ef4cfd6803825f5f474d12c12a02 i was only arguing the justice of it.... it’s nothing to do with me....” “but i think, if you would not do it yourself, there’s no justice about it.... let us have another game.”
0xe3cbbffbadc146a0466f28e2f2772eaa20f4ef23 raskolnikov was violently agitated.
0xfbb3a9fe268b620e2dad7d4f064f9ca6c8e81c80 of course, it was all ordinary youthful talk and thought, such as he had often heard before in different forms and on different themes.
0x24fbeca38c49a6545b0baecef5f0be7141fb115c but why had he happened to hear such a discussion and such ideas at the very moment when his own brain was just conceiving... _the very same ideas_?
0x9937046452dd0dbbffd61a0378937701d2faec66 and why, just at the moment when he had brought away the embryo of his idea from the old woman had he dropped at once upon a conversation about her?
0xc4c9069b90cb929d1450a4267acec07173927bc4 this coincidence always seemed strange to him.
0x29636ba7d06640116bd8912e6d4dc215a996aec8 this trivial talk in a tavern had an immense influence on him in his later action; as though there had really been in it something preordained, some guiding hint.... ***** on returning from the hay market he flung himself on the sofa and sat for a whole hour without stirring.
0x917240f7bede94b5ff31d06c18e32109a11cbc28 meanwhile it got dark; he had no candle and, indeed, it did not occur to him to light up.
0xceff947e9fcb87d8a06e38fe0f4dd5524aa6df09 he could never recollect whether he had been thinking about anything at that time.
0x91f73a078cee08f9afb0cfd8224a65285f48e378 at last he was conscious of his former fever and shivering, and he realised with relief that he could lie down on the sofa.
0xa9d624878692183def71da3a843a6a2ac99137e5 soon heavy, leaden sleep came over him, as it were crushing him.
0x9f6d113f8d70bee51977e35191f8c8da18a566f7 he slept an extraordinarily long time and without dreaming.
0x852fc917bc45535454926d2bc4d6f79fb90e55f4 nastasya, coming into his room at ten o’clock the next morning, had difficulty in rousing him.
0xbaf43d3c0f26220b405e4d213172f2fa12b03fc0 she brought him in tea and bread.
0x4919b1487b577d485d8e4016dea2930de5682b8e the tea was again the second brew and again in her own tea-pot.
0x17f3bce5aae287d38c78e3a1ad2bb063fa759e2d “my goodness, how he sleeps!”
0x34fe12523c4888d9cf49120147538c3254ac9243 she cried indignantly.
0xb82e7aace26aec505e9a910906b043931219f508 “and he is always asleep.”
0xb3ae6ae05d3351976242716af64a51f9fa643134 he got up with an effort.
0x1faf0bc4aba40f23409efe217342ea291b2a587b his head ached, he stood up, took a turn in his garret and sank back on the sofa again.
0xc7818ef2500dc5a0acae3c7a8b72384a84dcba5a “going to sleep again,” cried nastasya.
0xba162d75d6ed9c7059ec02e381b0c77697e44852 “are you ill, eh?”
0x1329946a3884aeeec417f0bdf2eb4cf593a33fe8 he made no reply.
0x175d607f7d5c97cdf8fc6c9be38d06a817b257ff “do you want some tea?”
0xa4b9574ddb21a225c2191b81bbe3b0f5ff4e98cc “afterwards,” he said with an effort, closing his eyes again and turning to the wall.
0xa9f982c879006e74fa9d35c79132c78592f761f8 nastasya stood over him.
0x657ecd4a9d27a96946d9ac1adfa39b1bdc73efbe “perhaps he really is ill,” she said, turned and went out.
0x5b1cb4762783c7a975ae82b7282d8ccc12c27a1c she came in again at two o’clock with soup.
0xc642f5e3a97226e90b189c30fee7ff24a4ef8c2c he was lying as before.
0xa1ea3f800ff2e2ba4abddf44b05602fe19f72889 the tea stood untouched.
0x84dc124e0e9eeb55992a4fd6ed0cbfb8951b8228 nastasya felt positively offended and began wrathfully rousing him.
0xbc8e0b7ef2b8e4402b1a6741a9f30e7c33feb15e “why are you lying like a log?”
0xa4ccc2bd2ebd25169de0a0640797cce738bfaf92 she shouted, looking at him with repulsion.
0xb3581e5cc3676019045330a1505f78920116939b he got up, and sat down again, but said nothing and stared at the floor.
0x616c2bc6fab459b14b1624c45613674419bfb6fd “are you ill or not?”
0x844f6bf72ab50b3ff05a621035e0aeebffcaf242 asked nastasya and again received no answer.
0x8bfc6117cf9bb9bcff227a3bb06da368f89edd84 “you’d better go out and get a breath of air,” she said after a pause.
0xcd6365880e167301dda5d8a1d8e8d17d37554847 “will you eat it or not?”
0xff2ca7e594c04f7eb1a967ebc588a2a3bb919722 “afterwards,” he said weakly.
0x3fc35f938125203caced7c4866d656adff5efd76 “you can go.”
0x379e8805e5dbac8b2432ce686472a803ce1ca1ce and he motioned her out.
0xe4e2e076862c5e055b410a4f36d74d750501858b she remained a little longer, looked at him with compassion and went out.
0x57fda1c8163cfaa06f973617bca27a69dec2d3c9 a few minutes afterwards, he raised his eyes and looked for a long while at the tea and the soup.
0xa4bb94322168cd25a4d519b38e29ab876899e053 then he took the bread, took up a spoon and began to eat.
0xc0628ebafb1d1d93725cc2a2067b024a2cf87eb7 he ate a little, three or four spoonfuls, without appetite, as it were mechanically.
0xa15f018ed32a9cc27a3acedf74261253b2e2bd75 his head ached less.
0x326a4c940fd059382f97d09e9f0b8e5db88e3e2b after his meal he stretched himself on the sofa again, but now he could not sleep; he lay without stirring, with his face in the pillow.
0x0b9d07f65cfd348b714406c906aaff5894036e26 he was haunted by day-dreams and such strange day-dreams; in one, that kept recurring, he fancied that he was in africa, in egypt, in some sort of oasis.
0x6b9ae7649a6a223645a29df1f62737d546b97e25 the caravan was resting, the camels were peacefully lying down; the palms stood all around in a complete circle; all the party were at dinner.
0x00e6a5cb49405905b85019ebf3d70924b3d8ad9b but he was drinking water from a spring which flowed gurgling close by.
0x267314a8f2897b9e84f8aac5a06ce30204857d5b and it was so cool, it was wonderful, wonderful, blue, cold water running among the parti-coloured stones and over the clean sand which glistened here and there like gold.... suddenly he heard a clock strike.
0x37feed665364127693589215fbdcef1b9dfff856 he started, roused himself, raised his head, looked out of the window, and seeing how late it was, suddenly jumped up wide awake as though someone had pulled him off the sofa.
0xe36fd7f278bd6992f52342288bce9bf7e46359d6 he crept on tiptoe to the door, stealthily opened it and began listening on the staircase.
0x62ed106352d0cc80fda650a3ab2353547966d711 his heart beat terribly.
0xc01d69f60575244ca1ac7c666fa73d472bbe0225 but all was quiet on the stairs as if everyone was asleep.... it seemed to him strange and monstrous that he could have slept in such forgetfulness from the previous day and had done nothing, had prepared nothing yet.... and meanwhile perhaps it had struck six.
0xcd82a2ddcd21f150992e7a4b2fc1c8bef263db94 and his drowsiness and stupefaction were followed by an extraordinary, feverish, as it were distracted haste.
0x167e5818db74d41f3815d2a461dfa769c0690805 but the preparations to be made were few.
0x126ac3826f160470e46ce25d81749d010c671534 he concentrated all his energies on thinking of everything and forgetting nothing; and his heart kept beating and thumping so that he could hardly breathe.
0x8c6351f8df9b55a5a978d8dee0ed8a84a2894812 first he had to make a noose and sew it into his overcoat--a work of a moment.
0xc6f5a25d17470b5a36fc3896176911743b276818 he rummaged under his pillow and picked out amongst the linen stuffed away under it, a worn out, old unwashed shirt.
0xf70607798c4a7bf842182e401ea1246e234dcf45 from its rags he tore a long strip, a couple of inches wide and about sixteen inches long.
0x7121d09fbf7ecc624b3c8ffb3a9012642c49ab39 he folded this strip in two, took off his wide, strong summer overcoat of some stout cotton material (his only outer garment) and began sewing the two ends of the rag on the inside, under the left armhole.
0x84055b69749fa013c0e35efb8528119b84b29f9d his hands shook as he sewed, but he did it successfully so that nothing showed outside when he put the coat on again.
0x32c85bc8789f406009267cc445bbdf3a80c71948 the needle and thread he had got ready long before and they lay on his table in a piece of paper.
0x5d62ea749ff4cdc2d8f017525d0e24a31ad3aba1 as for the noose, it was a very ingenious device of his own; the noose was intended for the axe.
0x5137e695458314106763f44b86beda2995c5fb2e it was impossible for him to carry the axe through the street in his hands.
0x846eff4038eaceb4309428e0cb0f7c00ed462183 and if hidden under his coat he would still have had to support it with his hand, which would have been noticeable.
0xce48277c6ed4c4066f090f46aebc3e210780f5ee now he had only to put the head of the axe in the noose, and it would hang quietly under his arm on the inside.
0x3cf7e431fb92d93c34544f2429c43ed636c454b0 putting his hand in his coat pocket, he could hold the end of the handle all the way, so that it did not swing; and as the coat was very full, a regular sack in fact, it could not be seen from outside that he was holding something with the hand that was in the pocket.
0x1260a8c4baaafb3d26dcd73b987ce75e7ffa1e79 this noose, too, he had designed a fortnight before.
0xa93c25235a2ba832cc562267c9817ca79949c23a when he had finished with this, he thrust his hand into a little opening between his sofa and the floor, fumbled in the left corner and drew out the _pledge_, which he had got ready long before and hidden there.
0x27882b55fb72f8f4fbb71a0e6be6423247299db6 this pledge was, however, only a smoothly planed piece of wood the size and thickness of a silver cigarette case.
0xb2dab31f2c6efaf85f0f3e0eab093ea64bc657b2 he picked up this piece of wood in one of his wanderings in a courtyard where there was some sort of a workshop.
0x2e739f90d1492360c1739ded68dba194feec9309 afterwards he had added to the wood a thin smooth piece of iron, which he had also picked up at the same time in the street.
0xe19270dd1c076de7ff606753ba380149520406d7 putting the iron which was a little the smaller on the piece of wood, he fastened them very firmly, crossing and re-crossing the thread round them; then wrapped them carefully and daintily in clean white paper and tied up the parcel so that it would be very difficult to untie it.
0x233c8c464d881874597802b0562cdc10ae477c7c this was in order to divert the attention of the old woman for a time, while she was trying to undo the knot, and so to gain a moment.
0x4e8af36396f667e305b07808529fa02746603b03 the iron strip was added to give weight, so that the woman might not guess the first minute that the “thing” was made of wood.
0x65fb4b7dc2b70a68e4dcc6d5f1646d45b31c5485 all this had been stored by him beforehand under the sofa.
0x506db4f18ccced7bd1966897e9f8c23c58bccb7d he had only just got the pledge out when he heard someone suddenly about in the yard.
0x3d15fa0517c1d5624e7a0bc93a2341fdb71d2920 “it struck six long ago.”
0x51549643f95dea013a7add07e9e8502c22b55b65 “long ago!
0x839d92e8591790de58b2a9824f27d6e8073e66f0 my god!”
0xb130849047befdbf7af6003990959806a11c68b6 he rushed to the door, listened, caught up his hat and began to descend his thirteen steps cautiously, noiselessly, like a cat.
0x104236500b5ac1eb195a119bf7b498088d447b16 he had still the most important thing to do--to steal the axe from the kitchen.
0x8596e3b9f34a5eba538556bc25d7f10997766a3a that the deed must be done with an axe he had decided long ago.
0x69112aa386f69c0b7ec4062062ead3425b64018c he had also a pocket pruning-knife, but he could not rely on the knife and still less on his own strength, and so resolved finally on the axe.
0x0316ea85569be3bcaf8e0c1d24483c4b5cb13697 we may note in passing, one peculiarity in regard to all the final resolutions taken by him in the matter; they had one strange characteristic: the more final they were, the more hideous and the more absurd they at once became in his eyes.
0x15cc414c0db23ffcb9855af37f48b10231296214 in spite of all his agonising inward struggle, he never for a single instant all that time could believe in the carrying out of his plans.
0xe8403b7f4882a7eaa39eb23bfbcc7506a23b3890 and, indeed, if it had ever happened that everything to the least point could have been considered and finally settled, and no uncertainty of any kind had remained, he would, it seems, have renounced it all as something absurd, monstrous and impossible.
0xc21b60ce1ef559ec1ae25f7081b604a894b93818 but a whole mass of unsettled points and uncertainties remained.
0x939b2af77dbce3f947f2461c00d2da2d74a2e1da as for getting the axe, that trifling business cost him no anxiety, for nothing could be easier.
0x5cd5055604e8c46499e61f1b10442dc4285c46ef nastasya was continually out of the house, especially in the evenings; she would run in to the neighbours or to a shop, and always left the door ajar.
0x2c055c5d7846121ccb0a637370df3f1f98178425 it was the one thing the landlady was always scolding her about.
0x265c5d2e70936501323dd943585493277a96e20f and so, when the time came, he would only have to go quietly into the kitchen and to take the axe, and an hour later (when everything was over) go in and put it back again.
0xf645f490adec927d6a97258d7a00fc28ce971a0e but these were doubtful points.
0xce8cf27f96ee5df77242735a8501e08bf4d5f85c supposing he returned an hour later to put it back, and nastasya had come back and was on the spot.
0x8b9f8c8364554d0d1b7b68fa2eb21f8664d5a0c3 he would of course have to go by and wait till she went out again.
0x47b90b617d69985053664d87768ff7c5e954a261 but supposing she were in the meantime to miss the axe, look for it, make an outcry--that would mean suspicion or at least grounds for suspicion.
0x3a9b16e62715371ce917a089ad07acd20659c5fe but those were all trifles which he had not even begun to consider, and indeed he had no time.
0x28983456b81bfd921564024e186bd71c80cb89da he was thinking of the chief point, and put off trifling details, until _he could believe in it all_.
0x6dd3536c855e8a1618f9715cc8f5b1002403813d but that seemed utterly unattainable.
0x12d13dce7ea9f333309b0e8513e97311f44dfbdc so it seemed to himself at least.
0x7a9d9f7a6fccd86e85bb6635a55856a57748a93b he could not imagine, for instance, that he would sometime leave off thinking, get up and simply go there.... even his late experiment (i.e. his visit with the object of a final survey of the place) was simply an attempt at an experiment, far from being the real thing, as though one should say “come, let us go and try it--why dream about it!”--and at once he had broken down and had run away cursing, in a frenzy with himself.
0x7ef9f3de507360383a6537320e53caf0830f0bd2 meanwhile it would seem, as regards the moral question, that his analysis was complete; his casuistry had become keen as a razor, and he could not find rational objections in himself.
0x13c14005d671e0a1018269074e9d25d00c1d61ba but in the last resort he simply ceased to believe in himself, and doggedly, slavishly sought arguments in all directions, fumbling for them, as though someone were forcing and drawing him to it.
0xb67736208e905c1f21b73c2daf09df125c9cd419 at first--long before indeed--he had been much occupied with one question; why almost all crimes are so badly concealed and so easily detected, and why almost all criminals leave such obvious traces?
0x730edbb2a6446e0747baf66f4c90a2a1152f5436 he had come gradually to many different and curious conclusions, and in his opinion the chief reason lay not so much in the material impossibility of concealing the crime, as in the criminal himself.
0xe4e527c8da7ec235e2d0c31b02d8f12da7970761 almost every criminal is subject to a failure of will and reasoning power by a childish and phenomenal heedlessness, at the very instant when prudence and caution are most essential.
0xb97207e743a9c121ca764cd6210edaf8018b8e15 it was his conviction that this eclipse of reason and failure of will power attacked a man like a disease, developed gradually and reached its highest point just before the perpetration of the crime, continued with equal violence at the moment of the crime and for longer or shorter time after, according to the individual case, and then passed off like any other disease.
0x842557e1f20b15e1a04f1814f9feeed2424bd713 the question whether the disease gives rise to the crime, or whether the crime from its own peculiar nature is always accompanied by something of the nature of disease, he did not yet feel able to decide.
0xdc7451d72c6df7506482a411568a47cb09f52324 when he reached these conclusions, he decided that in his own case there could not be such a morbid reaction, that his reason and will would remain unimpaired at the time of carrying out his design, for the simple reason that his design was “not a crime....” we will omit all the process by means of which he arrived at this last conclusion; we have run too far ahead already.... we may add only that the practical, purely material difficulties of the affair occupied a secondary position in his mind.
0xe8bb7f2fd3787bda73e5442717d65f2866f979cb “one has but to keep all one’s will-power and reason to deal with them, and they will all be overcome at the time when once one has familiarised oneself with the minutest details of the business....” but this preparation had never been begun.
0xe3916481b48363c6e68c012289f1c845f0e3183c his final decisions were what he came to trust least, and when the hour struck, it all came to pass quite differently, as it were accidentally and unexpectedly.
0x6aa9b5138dd9ff2935a33d03db76946ef014f18e one trifling circumstance upset his calculations, before he had even left the staircase.
0x045977c139d93c6f7e88a550d1f5fbed3ab2b97e when he reached the landlady’s kitchen, the door of which was open as usual, he glanced cautiously in to see whether, in nastasya’s absence, the landlady herself was there, or if not, whether the door to her own room was closed, so that she might not peep out when he went in for the axe.
0x789e776ab915ba8f905784d15ae693c12bbbae74 but what was his amazement when he suddenly saw that nastasya was not only at home in the kitchen, but was occupied there, taking linen out of a basket and hanging it on a line.
0x059056803e1abe5e56e6d6cb325b222f2a1c030c seeing him, she left off hanging the clothes, turned to him and stared at him all the time he was passing.
0x0508e5681e11340d70b2a13d440eca820d73c24e he turned away his eyes, and walked past as though he noticed nothing.
0xa1e0338e6d766399e75b974e627ebdb6ce606668 but it was the end of everything; he had not the axe!
0xb2c97dac4158306adeec9c87fb376ddace50d992 he was overwhelmed.
0xd009d9a9b38fab292a3327f71e5bd607b31a2a3e “what made me think,” he reflected, as he went under the gateway, “what made me think that she would be sure not to be at home at that moment!
0x5bc3f7d0b06219b5bae923d4504d8ddc88ad2652 why, why, why did i assume this so certainly?”
0x7e58e73ef7aceb90d468a6709de68f62b5d6bf3e he was crushed and even humiliated.
0x58030b64b90dbf85cb09331f4c68573871177b47 he could have laughed at himself in his anger.... a dull animal rage boiled within him.
0xdcc757bb7cca27d3ea0e97e1de6cd53a00891afa he stood hesitating in the gateway.
0x0b2265342d931c074787f2bbf4345a5ef3c01b11 to go into the street, to go a walk for appearance’ sake was revolting; to go back to his room, even more revolting.
0x9fe16311fadae302f3c34069b666612a2ac85ce3 “and what a chance i have lost for ever!”
0xde290cccfa9c8d64eefbbc70025bffed4583d2b3 he muttered, standing aimlessly in the gateway, just opposite the porter’s little dark room, which was also open.
0x16fc9dc2cb98d380754febc8ee61bdc181ce462a suddenly he started.
0xd61beed86b2fcc135745dfe412be31b6108e5ee8 from the porter’s room, two paces away from him, something shining under the bench to the right caught his eye.... he looked about him--nobody.
0xab3def3ca44e1b8a2d81e482f8f713e4fc69fd86 he approached the room on tiptoe, went down two steps into it and in a faint voice called the porter.
0x1e3a8b4991770662e7db3c8255280b06939f1de5 “yes, not at home!
0xe2856af4e95872fd6140c9bbfaea39858e248058 somewhere near though, in the yard, for the door is wide open.”
0x4ec3f309aec0c198520a67bf44a6f2c1a849749c he dashed to the axe (it was an axe) and pulled it out from under the bench, where it lay between two chunks of wood; at once, before going out, he made it fast in the noose, he thrust both hands into his pockets and went out of the room; no one had noticed him!
0xf8e53448156aa5acd5f5543cfcc0ffc0e3b32d41 “when reason fails, the devil helps!”
0x92c805c3b4378dccef22abe7ff55232458a531dd he thought with a strange grin.
0x15383f8d894c4ffa213b492007267ae3903c733f this chance raised his spirits extraordinarily.
0x2a6f3fb4bfaab8cea5fd5c69658371b6673dfbcf he walked along quietly and sedately, without hurry, to avoid awakening suspicion.
0xbdae6f86cbdb5596d02d7bc6b910b4d48401f683 he scarcely looked at the passers-by, tried to escape looking at their faces at all, and to be as little noticeable as possible.
0xbd2a1fe39f7c21e689fad621e05a811b3b40b7a6 suddenly he thought of his hat.
0x30b4b680a4068d82e915c51a0631bf04e40c8078 “good heavens!
0xaa3532f59a4b49dbd1dedf3c21c7ab59292fd06c i had the money the day before yesterday and did not get a cap to wear instead!”
0x22cbeccfc4f64af0003e45ed4287511ec1fe9a1b a curse rose from the bottom of his soul.
0x1f2e19837e929c0ddfec1aea51056e1e6e522acf glancing out of the corner of his eye into a shop, he saw by a clock on the wall that it was ten minutes past seven.
0x642feb45e8c01805578b7ecddc57e24283d60334 he had to make haste and at the same time to go someway round, so as to approach the house from the other side.... when he had happened to imagine all this beforehand, he had sometimes thought that he would be very much afraid.
0xf1b495057f16262157f1a86fe55f83895423314f but he was not very much afraid now, was not afraid at all, indeed.
0xe010f253b23765e9c7f2623cd633c32e406d224c his mind was even occupied by irrelevant matters, but by nothing for long.
0x7d924b4f8e816071a9d795dba60391268d65e801 as he passed the yusupov garden, he was deeply absorbed in considering the building of great fountains, and of their refreshing effect on the atmosphere in all the squares.
0xe4bd991179a468dffe70e38ea0a19ca28542413d by degrees he passed to the conviction that if the summer garden were extended to the field of mars, and perhaps joined to the garden of the mihailovsky palace, it would be a splendid thing and a great benefit to the town.
0xab245753ab18ed73e454076a6879e2ae286416df then he was interested by the question why in all great towns men are not simply driven by necessity, but in some peculiar way inclined to live in those parts of the town where there are no gardens nor fountains; where there is most dirt and smell and all sorts of nastiness.
0x19df8397523cf03360627b23ae71bdce9dade090 then his own walks through the hay market came back to his mind, and for a moment he waked up to reality.
0xb73af9a682ab156fb3faeb86c49f7a86c906e227 “what nonsense!”
0x447ef4f063cb3a21dca80ef68af0b053fefed551 he thought, “better think of nothing at all!”
0x72ddf6c170ddc4989b49cd32da4f04bf0784115e “so probably men led to execution clutch mentally at every object that meets them on the way,” flashed through his mind, but simply flashed, like lightning; he made haste to dismiss this thought.... and by now he was near; here was the house, here was the gate.
0x21ff52815d1f73bb1bc7a5ee77f4ecbada0589eb suddenly a clock somewhere struck once.
0xe5223fdb02d9ee9ecf8a04f7116dd98e3afde8a1 “what!
0xdf559eae3026d889c58378578a8b251d104357cc can it be half-past seven?
0xf9d6478f73e691b7462ab74579885eb9fdc43795 impossible, it must be fast!”
0xc6499a36acd541d5732594d6dc60c127e8df969c luckily for him, everything went well again at the gates.
0xff98f11ec7bbb451e3ca1c85edaff1bc542a9215 at that very moment, as though expressly for his benefit, a huge waggon of hay had just driven in at the gate, completely screening him as he passed under the gateway, and the waggon had scarcely had time to drive through into the yard, before he had slipped in a flash to the right.
0x5a70e9cabeec04a6d091fef22558032a9a0b1dc9 on the other side of the waggon he could hear shouting and quarrelling; but no one noticed him and no one met him.
0x071d98e4771e15506fc41655675dc12d155ce4ce many windows looking into that huge quadrangular yard were open at that moment, but he did not raise his head--he had not the strength to.
0xf066b37b04332961c1ca7c7e4acacea2db8b986b the staircase leading to the old woman’s room was close by, just on the right of the gateway.
0x878fc48a54caab03e5d0a6c77765b9153f401321 he was already on the stairs.... drawing a breath, pressing his hand against his throbbing heart, and once more feeling for the axe and setting it straight, he began softly and cautiously ascending the stairs, listening every minute.
0x0fc3e5982c141c1bd613eb0816546ffda678edbe but the stairs, too, were quite deserted; all the doors were shut; he met no one.
0x1fd9bc467b64bbdef53bf34c42768ee3f88b19ee one flat indeed on the first floor was wide open and painters were at work in it, but they did not glance at him.
0x40843180eb6c3d40375483ceae93125cfe87abd3 he stood still, thought a minute and went on.
0xd9b409d432a1c6add88f31a70ab88aa5be732466 “of course it would be better if they had not been here, but... it’s two storeys above them.”
0x442922a6608649fae383b29a475fb53ee2dea46b and there was the fourth storey, here was the door, here was the flat opposite, the empty one.
0x09721dca34451f9009c834217ad35ccb4dd3a438 the flat underneath the old woman’s was apparently empty also; the visiting card nailed on the door had been torn off--they had gone away!... he was out of breath.
0x5f80cc464a0208b2ef6bddf235996289baa6cd52 for one instant the thought floated through his mind “shall i go back?”
0xb08aef3dbd72c74cd90288333cb557e01a211c19 but he made no answer and began listening at the old woman’s door, a dead silence.
0xe8a4bb82961ef6828480e7c382dee452e908fd46 then he listened again on the staircase, listened long and intently... then looked about him for the last time, pulled himself together, drew himself up, and once more tried the axe in the noose.
0x5192d4f68fc73d4da98201fc955716ca0a88d812 “am i very pale?”
0x8a3862288ad1641200aaede1f31af715a8339768 he wondered.
0x3ca98089d0d110900d2ce4ce79aff64f2161647c “am i not evidently agitated?
0x0180d28c2ea2af080b9b5dd455309cc6be0da72f she is mistrustful.... had i better wait a little longer... till my heart leaves off thumping?”
0xf81c61164348d4bb4841597e96f1bd3458b1bb54 but his heart did not leave off.
0x4080aae7fb343f74f8e3a480abc455f00bf66502 on the contrary, as though to spite him, it throbbed more and more violently.
0x2db36e9d654be4778977fe773da27736500f2997 he could stand it no longer, he slowly put out his hand to the bell and rang.
0xe80b24e1898a773bab38c53401a63193b5c65122 half a minute later he rang again, more loudly.
0x564ee9632194e7f7956ad204cc947e3a617fdecb no answer.
0xbc9b82b37fe054f0ddce962aee3d1cdacec74a7d to go on ringing was useless and out of place.
0xa37e766cc4dccbdf3699f971e371f3a3dc58ce9d the old woman was, of course, at home, but she was suspicious and alone.
0x1febfdf1151565444e40b6c2df00730d566ec6f1 he had some knowledge of her habits... and once more he put his ear to the door.
0xb3436881d1462643aa6057927499184ac9c25bed either his senses were peculiarly keen (which it is difficult to suppose), or the sound was really very distinct.
0x39d07364ff1f8684d0c39d5132d6943d78f30369 anyway, he suddenly heard something like the cautious touch of a hand on the lock and the rustle of a skirt at the very door.
0xd4eaad0bfadef709fbc2d6a2527945d944ca0b8d someone was standing stealthily close to the lock and just as he was doing on the outside was secretly listening within, and seemed to have her ear to the door.... he moved a little on purpose and muttered something aloud that he might not have the appearance of hiding, then rang a third time, but quietly, soberly, and without impatience, recalling it afterwards, that moment stood out in his mind vividly, distinctly, for ever; he could not make out how he had had such cunning, for his mind was as it were clouded at moments and he was almost unconscious of his body.... an instant later he heard the latch unfastened.
0x3bf9a8e02bed09059297a04ff4444f31f26ea876 chapter vii the door was as before opened a tiny crack, and again two sharp and suspicious eyes stared at him out of the darkness.
0x478748af4403cdecd8bd17d1f672c67c656acee3 then raskolnikov lost his head and nearly made a great mistake.
0x8631ccfaba3a097cf72cc82a65d4f70bf87f2cca fearing the old woman would be frightened by their being alone, and not hoping that the sight of him would disarm her suspicions, he took hold of the door and drew it towards him to prevent the old woman from attempting to shut it again.
0x0c97b1fca303ff9b6c82663698151f295f8e0cb7 seeing this she did not pull the door back, but she did not let go the handle so that he almost dragged her out with it on to the stairs.
0x440f223f2d3f99de4cc1b0168eb876a062d9d311 seeing that she was standing in the doorway not allowing him to pass, he advanced straight upon her.
0x5de875bbda059e67ad7dc3eeea1482059dbe159a she stepped back in alarm, tried to say something, but seemed unable to speak and stared with open eyes at him.
0x36b60f7123f9933cf45468645eea841644daf7ee “good evening, alyona ivanovna,” he began, trying to speak easily, but his voice would not obey him, it broke and shook.
0x34ae095bf70bc30bcc08f7d8a16dc6d74165dfa5 “i have come... i have brought something... but we’d better come in... to the light....” and leaving her, he passed straight into the room uninvited.
0x4b006a397ec1789ef8d10934fe610ce31ac152e6 the old woman ran after him; her tongue was unloosed.
0x30b4b680a4068d82e915c51a0631bf04e40c8078 “good heavens!
0x66f02ba9610458b350e35c6fa31171d3dd0c0e7b what it is?
0x52c73659efacfeaa7195fe58e0f042c60315af9c who is it?
0x52aaff5156f81a630137cf1f6ec5b7861978feb3 what do you want?”
0x36820d2e5da0b34fe3d40459736aaa03f7d17c7e “why, alyona ivanovna, you know me... raskolnikov... here, i brought you the pledge i promised the other day...” and he held out the pledge.
0x301e306691427869bdcba69fe8e81858d8f1cd1e the old woman glanced for a moment at the pledge, but at once stared in the eyes of her uninvited visitor.
0xca3d6eeb626ec79f587cefa99b1bf359929266f5 she looked intently, maliciously and mistrustfully.
0xbc9dd6d761adca02ced7182d3aabe9c7317f95be a minute passed; he even fancied something like a sneer in her eyes, as though she had already guessed everything.
0x5ea78ce9570d0933b5fea9b96bd19a89dcf0a446 he felt that he was losing his head, that he was almost frightened, so frightened that if she were to look like that and not say a word for another half minute, he thought he would have run away from her.
0xa1cc53d61cc03491bf267b31ce211d97b4de1b4f “why do you look at me as though you did not know me?”
0x214cec85c27bbf2332f98d515b4c5e1610bf0e9a he said suddenly, also with malice.
0x90ab52d9565f65ff5848fab5137985345228f0c5 “take it if you like, if not i’ll go elsewhere, i am in a hurry.”
0x71c51d0b52b28dad6b800af4f2bf79d2559f48f8 he had not even thought of saying this, but it was suddenly said of itself.
0xda1d410516c2dc6c46353f4f2082b93bc7ae8a47 the old woman recovered herself, and her visitor’s resolute tone evidently restored her confidence.
0x9e2b74eb7827f822ce16604543d3d3c99786861e “but why, my good sir, all of a minute.... what is it?”
0xb6b7b739b18ff4778572d26e5f77f85b8cce45af she asked, looking at the pledge.
0x93215164b865502588bbabd336369bb5674331f9 “the silver cigarette case; i spoke of it last time, you know.”
0xab6d254d3098f1cc77cb1cf3f882527aa71a70fc she held out her hand.
0x7fb791698f6f9cd5df38701da87912846748f171 “but how pale you are, to be sure... and your hands are trembling too?
0x95c12a617672beebf1fadee17b7323dc90e7a954 have you been bathing, or what?”
0x868b3d7f6d34ea0168f42e5748ae42bf532d5c5d “fever,” he answered abruptly.
0x7befd75634badd73d3252334517484ad6db9c2db “you can’t help getting pale... if you’ve nothing to eat,” he added, with difficulty articulating the words.
0x0d8f6f6bd9be3aff6cf69527048487065a0859ee his strength was failing him again.
0xacf88a9d314bc3112aca55202cbde0f659b4ad7a but his answer sounded like the truth; the old woman took the pledge.
0xf7421ecf93fec117c5974f6568bf915fd84f7750 “what is it?”
0xbbc3d626fbea3bac742172e6efd4610e14f675be she asked once more, scanning raskolnikov intently, and weighing the pledge in her hand.
0xcb451485eadc092837bd94a3cac2e4a011ffb254 “a thing... cigarette case.... silver.... look at it.”
0x76386dfa4a1493ca65eade731df9cc55e3da35cd “it does not seem somehow like silver.... how he has wrapped it up!”
0x621e9c3c404b926aaaa31e3e79f2e568b4b037b9 trying to untie the string and turning to the window, to the light (all her windows were shut, in spite of the stifling heat), she left him altogether for some seconds and stood with her back to him.
0x9b2551e3187ef83a384e9ca3fa5d25512d61c120 he unbuttoned his coat and freed the axe from the noose, but did not yet take it out altogether, simply holding it in his right hand under the coat.
0xd3412fc6cb871dcb5b2e07fd437ef9d7272ae956 his hands were fearfully weak, he felt them every moment growing more numb and more wooden.
0x7f6ba13029c564c5d318166113c4844cb52ee0b2 he was afraid he would let the axe slip and fall.... a sudden giddiness came over him.
0xe1f802eec7ed0dadc1fa6ae349e70917973fd38e “but what has he tied it up like this for?”
0xd5d6dbdbe1da0dc8ee8d635464325a4728604af9 the old woman cried with vexation and moved towards him.
0x1e673b08c5ee0cd0bcab06e4353154c5f6f59ece he had not a minute more to lose.
0xd0757315e7b4f02d0c63ec676352f609afd27a0d he pulled the axe quite out, swung it with both arms, scarcely conscious of himself, and almost without effort, almost mechanically, brought the blunt side down on her head.
0xe01982abde82a2502159e1a6f01156e8f3e4bf0a he seemed not to use his own strength in this.
0x6498db3dc0d9ae6f661789966e461f3dbfc631d0 but as soon as he had once brought the axe down, his strength returned to him.
0xb7b2c1105351b656ff1743dc1744ff80c99ae1fe the old woman was as always bareheaded.
0x1e5d0f138c2a9fb232b834a412186fe5e2751d8b her thin, light hair, streaked with grey, thickly smeared with grease, was plaited in a rat’s tail and fastened by a broken horn comb which stood out on the nape of her neck.
0x37b8b71ce4a21c03d823035415846694d1c078c4 as she was so short, the blow fell on the very top of her skull.
0xb80258889e3892fe593d7c7ab11e18c86fc8cdae she cried out, but very faintly, and suddenly sank all of a heap on the floor, raising her hands to her head.
0xdd05405ea9cbe879d964f1717bcaa33145a192af in one hand she still held “the pledge.”
0x37617456e83024c5f7151bd5e587facb2db9defc then he dealt her another and another blow with the blunt side and on the same spot.
0xa3b23c76a69e8d9f67be060ea3c5ed54c883d203 the blood gushed as from an overturned glass, the body fell back.
0x6cf9ec8e7d0ad338ae418aaec9cd3ab0c73a4396 he stepped back, let it fall, and at once bent over her face; she was dead.
0x0fbf66f2fa0b367791a50aec04e531e57f601d96 her eyes seemed to be starting out of their sockets, the brow and the whole face were drawn and contorted convulsively.
0xcec2b9bd3c8ced60ed45784dd9434d3674097a46 he laid the axe on the ground near the dead body and felt at once in her pocket (trying to avoid the streaming body)--the same right-hand pocket from which she had taken the key on his last visit.
0x36a73e0c007c3d7020190c0830bd4708099a83f8 he was in full possession of his faculties, free from confusion or giddiness, but his hands were still trembling.
0x614262afed33b308d95e2452c76e89aecd96f71f he remembered afterwards that he had been particularly collected and careful, trying all the time not to get smeared with blood.... he pulled out the keys at once, they were all, as before, in one bunch on a steel ring.
0xa5449be3021178d426719a0903cfb9875e021e1c he ran at once into the bedroom with them.
0x16eddb4bd87c49f099b5361e573b39df1c331071 it was a very small room with a whole shrine of holy images.
0x9e1e68218d5da9bcb0fd908da6d7ee5996f5557d against the other wall stood a big bed, very clean and covered with a silk patchwork wadded quilt.
0xeed0bbcf9ea22f0e9ca60344dc4c3021c899d5e5 against a third wall was a chest of drawers.
0x9aff8c981322bc952ac996c2e81df4bdd4e1f51e strange to say, so soon as he began to fit the keys into the chest, so soon as he heard their jingling, a convulsive shudder passed over him.
0x18943ffda70fa7d037f5a09950c3332835575c8d he suddenly felt tempted again to give it all up and go away.
0x220a6db4ebcaa06732a983bd4eaf96cf0387885a but that was only for an instant; it was too late to go back.
0xf2a122cf442ea1a31e84632d0972afb5b2e6c4d0 he positively smiled at himself, when suddenly another terrifying idea occurred to his mind.
0xc1cc3355221cf1edbe8f2b82d0d1c4a886b81f18 he suddenly fancied that the old woman might be still alive and might recover her senses.
0x5e106c2772c2b25dcc09a67e3613bd04c174b04a leaving the keys in the chest, he ran back to the body, snatched up the axe and lifted it once more over the old woman, but did not bring it down.
0x26a1fe481e7d76b0f9157ce09968bc6d4e287953 there was no doubt that she was dead.
0x0ac8ad2c56d9e1b66bf6bc7ae6541a6895d84be6 bending down and examining her again more closely, he saw clearly that the skull was broken and even battered in on one side.
0x125579486858725d519bf9c726a6454cfc48cb60 he was about to feel it with his finger, but drew back his hand and indeed it was evident without that.
0xdc6c27a0a468a6c3be1e1600e2dd52aba6f45e5d meanwhile there was a perfect pool of blood.
0x0528850513e602c9727c74d3248a8d432205c732 all at once he noticed a string on her neck; he tugged at it, but the string was strong and did not snap and besides, it was soaked with blood.
0xef43bf89ba92902777076b7026aa735c50f0fa94 he tried to pull it out from the front of the dress, but something held it and prevented its coming.
0x13a039b435ddfdb05f87aa855eb916fa6b4e782d in his impatience he raised the axe again to cut the string from above on the body, but did not dare, and with difficulty, smearing his hand and the axe in the blood, after two minutes’ hurried effort, he cut the string and took it off without touching the body with the axe; he was not mistaken--it was a purse.
0xeebd7035cb187abc8eb301f0883aabac6455ddb7 on the string were two crosses, one of cyprus wood and one of copper, and an image in silver filigree, and with them a small greasy chamois leather purse with a steel rim and ring.
0xa683ffbfdd2c9b8c1b31f7ceffd8e5445e04be98 the purse was stuffed very full; raskolnikov thrust it in his pocket without looking at it, flung the crosses on the old woman’s body and rushed back into the bedroom, this time taking the axe with him.
0x8255a8430514472fdcf281eb98a8ae16288991b2 he was in terrible haste, he snatched the keys, and began trying them again.
0xaca2e7f0df71cd096e85fc0bf804baa69a70b855 but he was unsuccessful.
0x878636bd7d30575836acf9a18480c421e8c60b7e they would not fit in the locks.
0xead2ee90b92cc1100bd2c46e88d330181458ed75 it was not so much that his hands were shaking, but that he kept making mistakes; though he saw for instance that a key was not the right one and would not fit, still he tried to put it in.
0x28e16a7c61d8b670a929f0293fc6f63a5673b684 suddenly he remembered and realised that the big key with the deep notches, which was hanging there with the small keys could not possibly belong to the chest of drawers (on his last visit this had struck him), but to some strong box, and that everything perhaps was hidden in that box.
0xcdb163491014def621264c44e7cd7c60248d499c he left the chest of drawers, and at once felt under the bedstead, knowing that old women usually keep boxes under their beds.
0x91eedfa33ee58f164e711f1cf2ad757bcf428486 and so it was; there was a good-sized box under the bed, at least a yard in length, with an arched lid covered with red leather and studded with steel nails.
0x9da9a2db630187d230fe5b0d1bf6a0cdfc219ee7 the notched key fitted at once and unlocked it.
0x267690b398619a64b791b87d010b22a39d999a2c at the top, under a white sheet, was a coat of red brocade lined with hareskin; under it was a silk dress, then a shawl and it seemed as though there was nothing below but clothes.
0x9f371c59d58b2f504d85bc789f4670b92d740bc5 the first thing he did was to wipe his blood-stained hands on the red brocade.
0x305b43be1c1cfb3aca81909e90a8763bce504285 “it’s red, and on red blood will be less noticeable,” the thought passed through his mind; then he suddenly came to himself.
0x07f56ce0d47417f652c495dd45c9f1e9684552b2 “good god, am i going out of my senses?”
0xf0d93b7e2051453607808b37febea042dac267a3 he thought with terror.
0x014a14f70aaa77ba998744330e59f004b311ae05 but no sooner did he touch the clothes than a gold watch slipped from under the fur coat.
0x3e61134fa562c7702ddab3fdadf91fffe9226826 he made haste to turn them all over.
0xe1c1255e886408ea9ea768c3ea350f3f0ddb2f9a there turned out to be various articles made of gold among the clothes--probably all pledges, unredeemed or waiting to be redeemed--bracelets, chains, ear-rings, pins and such things.
0xcb69eb192d0426923f407bc061f2b415b74f9bd3 some were in cases, others simply wrapped in newspaper, carefully and exactly folded, and tied round with tape.
0x08cc1174af931e7b9b04c61bcb775a7d2ce84f68 without any delay, he began filling up the pockets of his trousers and overcoat without examining or undoing the parcels and cases; but he had not time to take many.... he suddenly heard steps in the room where the old woman lay.
0xc26b4591d4e8d647e42100dfb56e048aca85a69e he stopped short and was still as death.
0xef5b873cbef4ad7e27ac52c5c1845ac5b07f0a1a but all was quiet, so it must have been his fancy.
0x3f38b3157103635ac5d3f1d5799f47e7c2e1c159 all at once he heard distinctly a faint cry, as though someone had uttered a low broken moan.
0x8a8f607ca080547bca36100d922955b4cc932fd8 then again dead silence for a minute or two.
0xd22a3867eacb220671289d3add1804e3fdd1471d he sat squatting on his heels by the box and waited holding his breath.
0xec2fc624d4f98c9baeb41344631c2a21a3e0922e suddenly he jumped up, seized the axe and ran out of the bedroom.
0x999b9944dc9c5e08334f8594ea7184a2fcff48d4 in the middle of the room stood lizaveta with a big bundle in her arms.
0xc1d024eb7faae077087193a7b8cfc093085d5bd3 she was gazing in stupefaction at her murdered sister, white as a sheet and seeming not to have the strength to cry out.
0x53d08fc097802ebb1c76f50f0665c704d21c2f07 seeing him run out of the bedroom, she began faintly quivering all over, like a leaf, a shudder ran down her face; she lifted her hand, opened her mouth, but still did not scream.
0xf62b520dd0c8de73ec3748c8b3342bde7840376e she began slowly backing away from him into the corner, staring intently, persistently at him, but still uttered no sound, as though she could not get breath to scream.
0x9bb33b3f077a3ec108d219029c3aca57487de3a8 he rushed at her with the axe; her mouth twitched piteously, as one sees babies’ mouths, when they begin to be frightened, stare intently at what frightens them and are on the point of screaming.
0x6485b1a2b9a58df14d66a554af31763ad3dc0f56 and this hapless lizaveta was so simple and had been so thoroughly crushed and scared that she did not even raise a hand to guard her face, though that was the most necessary and natural action at the moment, for the axe was raised over her face.
0x591a61f86e7cf93d3339dd66c4f4231c95991b36 she only put up her empty left hand, but not to her face, slowly holding it out before her as though motioning him away.
0x0008c7250a3b76c94ca6ad28a18416a8021407a7 the axe fell with the sharp edge just on the skull and split at one blow all the top of the head.
0xe088557d10fdda76491591e96c7ce395e0228f81 she fell heavily at once.
0xf7a50bf41f02f799392b589bf23b1ed6d72c35da raskolnikov completely lost his head, snatching up her bundle, dropped it again and ran into the entry.
0x8c77de03aca19fdcd2965c47858e920eddb66c39 fear gained more and more mastery over him, especially after this second, quite unexpected murder.
0xb5502452d3cab1efea0437e38e8fd1ef58c606d3 he longed to run away from the place as fast as possible.
0x8f81b9cc5fc9f1f6fa5452cba5d6b8d23918741d and if at that moment he had been capable of seeing and reasoning more correctly, if he had been able to realise all the difficulties of his position, the hopelessness, the hideousness and the absurdity of it, if he could have understood how many obstacles and, perhaps, crimes he had still to overcome or to commit, to get out of that place and to make his way home, it is very possible that he would have flung up everything, and would have gone to give himself up, and not from fear, but from simple horror and loathing of what he had done.
0x9d0634d882af8e5807a7d5dc563c795c6e2e57e8 the feeling of loathing especially surged up within him and grew stronger every minute.
0x80c02b92b353873dc4c3fa56f7e7a24c5313bec2 he would not now have gone to the box or even into the room for anything in the world.
0x41c967fa79ad1aae893900020b56b4642e75d4d2 but a sort of blankness, even dreaminess, had begun by degrees to take possession of him; at moments he forgot himself, or rather, forgot what was of importance, and caught at trifles.
0xf79693b30ee184a9b7462277ea7f9f65d7dac73e glancing, however, into the kitchen and seeing a bucket half full of water on a bench, he bethought him of washing his hands and the axe.
0x0ea12de2798bba197488ecab810a534bddc27dcd his hands were sticky with blood.
0x938f1fab21c3e25bda8648c2b12cc5297e412728 he dropped the axe with the blade in the water, snatched a piece of soap that lay in a broken saucer on the window, and began washing his hands in the bucket.
0xeb15e175c5ceccf634d0143a5452dc15b926baa6 when they were clean, he took out the axe, washed the blade and spent a long time, about three minutes, washing the wood where there were spots of blood rubbing them with soap.
0x6159402a6704927e9f05183d3a8a8a72590d910c then he wiped it all with some linen that was hanging to dry on a line in the kitchen and then he was a long while attentively examining the axe at the window.
0xa21f5f8ddb72923b740f5b60d861fef030282f22 there was no trace left on it, only the wood was still damp.
0x033d86fce93bdd4a5316a935da710986d8a761dc he carefully hung the axe in the noose under his coat.
0x5265fd6dbfd95fef3135613f5ee95d095942d705 then as far as was possible, in the dim light in the kitchen, he looked over his overcoat, his trousers and his boots.
0xb5d8a3e4bcf259bfb1d337e866cea1f9a8ea216f at the first glance there seemed to be nothing but stains on the boots.
0x7639c1b01a3d9fc362f62b49a955975f7dbc8f29 he wetted the rag and rubbed the boots.
0x0d15ea57734de9983f0cff33d8c557fe710c6ff3 but he knew he was not looking thoroughly, that there might be something quite noticeable that he was overlooking.
0x57b89d74202a1ddd832e7562e2449e883487f67c he stood in the middle of the room, lost in thought.
0xabb9c288b47ed7ec3e4061d0535349813cbaacfb dark agonising ideas rose in his mind--the idea that he was mad and that at that moment he was incapable of reasoning, of protecting himself, that he ought perhaps to be doing something utterly different from what he was now doing.
0x6acf8b95b0d7967bfa0db2077e2289bde77e5a74 “good god!”
0x516c610739822f8885b57f6a69d490de367942f7 he muttered “i must fly, fly,” and he rushed into the entry.
0x7a3b5a4d2bc3e954a60eaff19c6be563b524a205 but here a shock of terror awaited him such as he had never known before.
0xa058fe357b8555716d828c94b7f1be217d701c53 he stood and gazed and could not believe his eyes: the door, the outer door from the stairs, at which he had not long before waited and rung, was standing unfastened and at least six inches open.
0x04907e867c9ffef055ea3fb3b3790315949a6a5a no lock, no bolt, all the time, all that time!
0x21f8909a3fc1acef77b445ff8dd10bb1cd6c300d the old woman had not shut it after him perhaps as a precaution.
0xd2d18401a5208de58a0547a09a6601d461d15054 but, good god!
0xf37ab8e3212fd85cf74aae5ebd7e76d1e60dfa18 why, he had seen lizaveta afterwards!
0x78c7067e5e4df46f91c849f2ee762f0ee1edeb6b and how could he, how could he have failed to reflect that she must have come in somehow!
0xa1b599b0a7f7b3a79771530680a1b0258c34112f she could not have come through the wall!
0x48f25820c3e7568bd1240ea3c719bbee1959aa2c he dashed to the door and fastened the latch.
0xb25631a0918dba72c56b6bb89e98d722e5283efb “but no, the wrong thing again!
0x6671d367408f443bfbe1dca897e3b789a68727b6 i must get away, get away....” he unfastened the latch, opened the door and began listening on the staircase.
0x52adfef82665f3a9a3cc7e93a96f4f97d459c591 he listened a long time.
0x5b2a0e5eadcadf12caf82fa2b7b717681142c774 somewhere far away, it might be in the gateway, two voices were loudly and shrilly shouting, quarrelling and scolding.
0x4818d998526fa17d12af2d23946e9aaea0dd3c97 “what are they about?”
0x7faa9b5c4e4a004dfda65883241f7b8161b8b098 he waited patiently.
0x8d5390e2c9bcf5eb885dc318a5c7a645babbac2d at last all was still, as though suddenly cut off; they had separated.
0xad648883cabde53680b4ae26882e20a28fc8c864 he was meaning to go out, but suddenly, on the floor below, a door was noisily opened and someone began going downstairs humming a tune.
0x8047e176ae5cb6d5cb4a12737272a33893d6962c “how is it they all make such a noise?”
0xa5fe50718a585c571f9a77d0f5467871c2ea8365 flashed through his mind.
0x49a6f657f6f886121e0f7a16229f05571dc48ad6 once more he closed the door and waited.
0x1d6511b5aaabd68bfc1bd2d6281a9d12e8ea2c3f at last all was still, not a soul stirring.
0x1df08e19981b030cedb0caccc030c8c88c1ea266 he was just taking a step towards the stairs when he heard fresh footsteps.
0xd93ec2da8b6f389ef7768f5cfa0577fda8779aad the steps sounded very far off, at the very bottom of the stairs, but he remembered quite clearly and distinctly that from the first sound he began for some reason to suspect that this was someone coming _there_, to the fourth floor, to the old woman.
0xc1d2a529e188ba52f8833b3cc9e41eb29f30b41e why?
0xa9814dde88bd268bdf2b02b89492012302db3b6e were the sounds somehow peculiar, significant?
0x71ac027e8b4ea37f344b75c2b837435850b749bb the steps were heavy, even and unhurried.
0xd0eb308019724428c679abc9b8c5a306eab17408 now _he_ had passed the first floor, now he was mounting higher, it was growing more and more distinct!
0xfe49119a4226ec5449e29a3fa32892088cb31a26 he could hear his heavy breathing.
0x23490ccb0ce610f512420bb6a97a2f62513db24e and now the third storey had been reached.
0xff7701f55bd4df66839db4e955d485f259fc47d8 coming here!
0x66c21cf0876736101e73b354e63bf3dd82e8a65a and it seemed to him all at once that he was turned to stone, that it was like a dream in which one is being pursued, nearly caught and will be killed, and is rooted to the spot and cannot even move one’s arms.
0xffff42016ad33e27f264af12c8ff422c8c98fd17 at last when the unknown was mounting to the fourth floor, he suddenly started, and succeeded in slipping neatly and quickly back into the flat and closing the door behind him.
0x2dc5a6b71a133c2e9f0c9e5edeff0a4bfa40489d then he took the hook and softly, noiselessly, fixed it in the catch.
0x2185cd2e64a4572ba8572ab638d500fb3544c1e8 instinct helped him.
0x1d4e36e1e67d8c828f8d29152feca9e74e2aaed0 when he had done this, he crouched holding his breath, by the door.
0x4aa89545a399226af968f9c703beecf0682cd284 the unknown visitor was by now also at the door.
0x69264f825ce832556e212686e0deeec8346e44f0 they were now standing opposite one another, as he had just before been standing with the old woman, when the door divided them and he was listening.
0x9e695100ee81101631f066f4aa27a74577501e22 the visitor panted several times.
0x1f8c32e071ec6f688a98357a1858cf587d32c63d “he must be a big, fat man,” thought raskolnikov, squeezing the axe in his hand.
0xf2d6a1e3f3b2bf46a97ff182fa58382f50bf424a it seemed like a dream indeed.
0xcba124b8818635d60ec13c1ab3c7f6a0a679f00f the visitor took hold of the bell and rang it loudly.
0x80d4fe71ddf86e9c8e3ecba5305bc03c803c842c as soon as the tin bell tinkled, raskolnikov seemed to be aware of something moving in the room.
0x212115d332070bb675e6e7fbb04bdb6fcab37da1 for some seconds he listened quite seriously.
0x06ef0f51ce2e84ab3fe1f68eed8ac496adc6b023 the unknown rang again, waited and suddenly tugged violently and impatiently at the handle of the door.
0xc8c6b8a56ce0598a58d109a360889397a943eb03 raskolnikov gazed in horror at the hook shaking in its fastening, and in blank terror expected every minute that the fastening would be pulled out.
0xc9114a0c0afb3a005d9bc0fd33179cffc7c0dbb1 it certainly did seem possible, so violently was he shaking it.
0x9d636947af3c5e22d41375a790aa4ab05c961086 he was tempted to hold the fastening, but _he_ might be aware of it.
0x7e079af71edf583be281e21ebd25e77dfbe6a168 a giddiness came over him again.
0xfc5bf386cbcdd71c5887778ad7e63c6f05abdb95 “i shall fall down!”
0xfbaa5251fa456aebc1b5d275be47e84064083fc8 flashed through his mind, but the unknown began to speak and he recovered himself at once.
0x8c76146c98b4eeb7afebe08763e6818269073905 “what’s up?
0x10afb3ae3930856f674ec4b8b336f4de2cff197e are they asleep or murdered?
0xc8f3c939e9abbbf19063fce6700424d24356256e d-damn them!”
0xcd2e92a4d9d5a3bfe1d032b325f4244a2af3aed8 he bawled in a thick voice, “hey, alyona ivanovna, old witch!
0xf1973c2676ef23821de6a69d2c8df349ef705f62 lizaveta ivanovna, hey, my beauty!
0xeb61a1ae502e26b932b5ec60135ba4d7b6168204 open the door!
0x3b2c8ec0560168c46048db7207c5439d6efb7d55 oh, damn them!
0x7b1204462a058a58d849fd5bddb4724e7d99ef78 are they asleep or what?”
0x7d071613f16c4116afddcf49e82634d9d8d0a729 and again, enraged, he tugged with all his might a dozen times at the bell.
0x5b7f8312221c071ceaf52e9d88a2f81df5938e7c he must certainly be a man of authority and an intimate acquaintance.
0x74718df075187a0810196a598bc8762e546f9e91 at this moment light hurried steps were heard not far off, on the stairs.
0xd217782808defbc51ee4e9d268300960cdf5d431 someone else was approaching.
0x2b7a907ec72d5f9a2e9b0cd50e261b1dceba17ba raskolnikov had not heard them at first.
0x98709f6834c6957f2303d0d71aa96bc5315abda6 “you don’t say there’s no one at home,” the new-comer cried in a cheerful, ringing voice, addressing the first visitor, who still went on pulling the bell.
0xb1e75f342fceb9ef09439aa7b380ca9cc62317d3 “good evening, koch.”
0x8aa801415cea3cea1aa80b687975396d11855550 “from his voice he must be quite young,” thought raskolnikov.
0x67e20f7d2b1e204ec76283daf5ac58fb39a458b8 “who the devil can tell?
0x3a71c4a269cdff89bad8469f514366f083c0da88 i’ve almost broken the lock,” answered koch.
0x668bea375ea673d61248097f6e318e36c705035b “but how do you come to know me?”
0xfc660e555c19fc79b87ce27d5263fe6b9040609a “why!
0x6bf83d02b32209a7723458f27965a9bec09132b8 the day before yesterday i beat you three times running at billiards at gambrinus’.”
0x8919185c32732e1c588af6077850cdf5b717f570 “oh!”
0xc62929062de77a429750a204799c41c74a1f841e “so they are not at home?
0x9129eb7132975204e28b4696f3588f7ec539f1e3 that’s queer.
0xf08e5a87c89a17f1cab1385967a86e558102c54f it’s awfully stupid though.
0xac88612fc95f6c3834f72741c4ffb510e3b43918 where could the old woman have gone?
0xfcb45b5c07140816cff206e714671a41f27d4b93 i’ve come on business.”
0x88960626ff6ee4dce260a1f6b633547a74eafa17 “yes; and i have business with her, too.”
0x715fe28858bfd18580ed057505930a2594e8a199 “well, what can we do?
0x76061285613a0af2c89f8c9f70d56261fc69e034 go back, i suppose, aie--aie!
0xe0884eca92306b54465541cd63783945b78bfa2c and i was hoping to get some money!”
0x89e1ea80ef910ab877984b87c5c55ac3b2b90dbb cried the young man.
0xe4ecc8ef069fcc0688f1ee6b3b9dd2e66a12d45a “we must give it up, of course, but what did she fix this time for?
0x971880584c2a28c4304ef3ecc090f7dcb29cc6cd the old witch fixed the time for me to come herself.
0xc7efbd458bdec1f3f9304e2044b5e34e5cc2dc58 it’s out of my way.
0x1a38eff7fcff4991631e5f4d568b458307598ce1 and where the devil she can have got to, i can’t make out.
0xec7a9413df02cc6f597cad4bb0c6538ec626be73 she sits here from year’s end to year’s end, the old hag; her legs are bad and yet here all of a sudden she is out for a walk!”
0x1372f1f5d5081fb582f4edeac73ef55531e27dce “hadn’t we better ask the porter?”
0xe289aec3e0f10cf03bf5f5877dd53b83ef42d86f “what?”
0xb891d940938746afe4a82e89c2a5f15941fa857f “where she’s gone and when she’ll be back.”
0x8fbe330adb1facb3876908d6cfb379d43290a3b3 “hm.... damn it all!... we might ask.... but you know she never does go anywhere.”
0x39678ae88b4ce85db5ef692dba60b56b4493417a and he once more tugged at the door-handle.
0x5c60fcceaba7ba152e33d5c0224bc2149ed6a6cf “damn it all.
0x4b2adadedd024598dcf27b907faa0b3d2e9f62ce there’s nothing to be done, we must go!”
0x16ea930d34fd3b14902e85ea6517913f1c2769e2 “stay!”
0xf2d65fa7a1bb898af113d42b15882ff3f91d2c1e cried the young man suddenly.
0x45bc41c12b1128a8181965ec6d5d573829b987f5 “do you see how the door shakes if you pull it?”
0xeb72f99e0fb55a4aab85ee2cbbbf005118624953 “well?”
0x6859ad4175756bc03b04746c5e9084316b691a7b “that shows it’s not locked, but fastened with the hook!
0xb4a9f036ee89cc4f5f8a934ebac0af4027e13dd5 do you hear how the hook clanks?”
0xeb72f99e0fb55a4aab85ee2cbbbf005118624953 “well?”
0x993e413b9da23a90460279e07d9154535d14292e “why, don’t you see?
0x1fa1ecda9eb36ddfc6affe6f77a92353f31f62c2 that proves that one of them is at home.
0x677adb970f31be175834e56cba5b98e65a7690af if they were all out, they would have locked the door from the outside with the key and not with the hook from inside.
0x018b4a7050db8d567a5cf5b4a804e3d4b29db85a there, do you hear how the hook is clanking?
0xf2405d2d0198412b26a4585baada48f8160e86c3 to fasten the hook on the inside they must be at home, don’t you see.
0x4348b8844b5aec96ef3e3e2ec0c19ae8e8340472 so there they are sitting inside and don’t open the door!”
0x97c197ebe39675e7084fec8510e5080475f1049b “well!
0xb58e86f3da5d7ce39f1688ff89a60df697a49de0 and so they must be!”
0xaaca7b61fc4dd5605faecd759ff1427bb7ef12f4 cried koch, astonished.
0x1672b15f8eabc69423756c5e84b8c8474d0e6876 “what are they about in there?”
0x4960b2f1e8d6cf873e79a21efaf2855f785dcf15 and he began furiously shaking the door.
0x16ea930d34fd3b14902e85ea6517913f1c2769e2 “stay!”
0x7d2089ceb39f4141fe9e1a7f6b974f09202a3368 cried the young man again.
0x97b60651f44ff51b0df7ddb45954ff15673b7660 “don’t pull at it!
0x2783e58b4548bb71e5458b81c581ede2320d4ea7 there must be something wrong.... here, you’ve been ringing and pulling at the door and still they don’t open!
0x9a6023f73f9518ad0ca0db24a52eafdba82232a5 so either they’ve both fainted or...” “what?”
0x5fa1d83b915c3cf0fa58ac1813fd5df71a2d5e5a “i tell you what.
0xbdd4db8ef72f1b70ecc97f92beb4a356bbd4ea50 let’s go fetch the porter, let him wake them up.”
0x2c4522c6157f781c421cddd2a0e90ed245132105 “all right.”
0x8dbaf7f13479c70b1e8705901317f3867545f272 both were going down.
0x99d9b5b1b75c0f3996f76bfd24f589a687040cde “stay.
0xe7821e88b6bad97da4669e6691cd358548c44d1d you stop here while i run down for the porter.”
0x9135666acdbcfb30b7cbe989f03426b1b4c883b8 “what for?”
0x5ca535ee038c3a8325e993203e87850c9bfc04ba “well, you’d better.”
0x2c4522c6157f781c421cddd2a0e90ed245132105 “all right.”
0x7aa5b9b2f9c7e87f7363019a2cd03d9f285a8b55 “i’m studying the law you see!
0xc591539c1590ea7c92e57afe80ae20644c88f329 it’s evident, e-vi-dent there’s something wrong here!”
0xf9840b64474813adc80a23ea8c5207dd4276cd87 the young man cried hotly, and he ran downstairs.
0xae35334592812ad1c69a6fd9eb48330f0e2a2464 koch remained.
0x5b7887718b584ca056efcb34bec9aacd6e2caf9a once more he softly touched the bell which gave one tinkle, then gently, as though reflecting and looking about him, began touching the door-handle pulling it and letting it go to make sure once more that it was only fastened by the hook.
0xdbee2b922078b18500b659bab874cb4b7430c477 then puffing and panting he bent down and began looking at the keyhole: but the key was in the lock on the inside and so nothing could be seen.
0x2ab60073221867d626aa0dc70ff4173ed2801aa5 raskolnikov stood keeping tight hold of the axe.
0xdf5d52685acd24fa481ff75bd89501a6c7d6e2ee he was in a sort of delirium.
0xdffd3235f87ad650cdf4eb8db0208343bd5c0393 he was even making ready to fight when they should come in.
0xd6d1a8799be8783ad495767f4140d560b7d3d178 while they were knocking and talking together, the idea several times occurred to him to end it all at once and shout to them through the door.
0x3ed69901c58f85b54549c996f47f5ce5abbf8f99 now and then he was tempted to swear at them, to jeer at them, while they could not open the door!
0x964cf9fd53be537384d4f60fcc3d406c31079851 “only make haste!”
0x9c3a0a6542bc9dadea11a5409efef56de95afe95 was the thought that flashed through his mind.
0xa84352676529a5361647c24898a410d52feb4baa “but what the devil is he about?...”
0xf1b3a7cb8dcd1345948b6ec6a4ccfd3827032ab8 time was passing, one minute, and another--no one came.
0xe4c4f9064e3819d9f89c69e5cf6ffc4f0667d948 koch began to be restless.
0xe1b2ac9aec91c23b7991fb47cf96f670394f60ed “what the devil?”
0x9182d5777fcb9e527db3a3d23dbfd95d1881517f he cried suddenly and in impatience deserting his sentry duty, he, too, went down, hurrying and thumping with his heavy boots on the stairs.
0x817a769a5d6dee529e9d931b0e7d9b8ba9c3b2ee the steps died away.
0x30b4b680a4068d82e915c51a0631bf04e40c8078 “good heavens!
0x6e0e5eeee8c2dcedb9ed2628ef2ef1569aaebbad what am i to do?”
0xbc098385e7263b99213da58ac90bf0d34f7da592 raskolnikov unfastened the hook, opened the door--there was no sound.
0x06afe0412473b838fdb8bca9fed9db0c9f6a8c27 abruptly, without any thought at all, he went out, closing the door as thoroughly as he could, and went downstairs.
0x1b70f9e2eb5cd0bd635c30d065c62da959233a7e he had gone down three flights when he suddenly heard a loud voice below--where could he go!
0xdd58ae68d5062180f6e303a8db114d6d3db64d1f there was nowhere to hide.
0x1913d5d87378016b8b193445f899d44e4d21a20a he was just going back to the flat.
0x4f086a94d25b1ea3f599ab2ed372618ceb62b0f0 “hey there!
0x2cd2578c81e1cdbf1ee5fe5ee94f0fca6025a815 catch the brute!”
0x837a120eb3555f1c56330eddf271fe89808f4476 somebody dashed out of a flat below, shouting, and rather fell than ran down the stairs, bawling at the top of his voice.
0x64bb3801300c1ab5caa12f2c2b3778bacb051e47 “mitka!
0xf3b2cbefb7de4ead59fee212227cbd4bf77b7c47 mitka!
0xf3b2cbefb7de4ead59fee212227cbd4bf77b7c47 mitka!
0xf3b2cbefb7de4ead59fee212227cbd4bf77b7c47 mitka!
0xf3b2cbefb7de4ead59fee212227cbd4bf77b7c47 mitka!
0x9d5156772c85a801508f4f03e5f1dfd3dd819610 blast him!”
0xd6a283b879af744aaf6805dce60a90e89f8dd043 the shout ended in a shriek; the last sounds came from the yard; all was still.
0xf7bfd7e7345f1fbdd41fc6b1e33e191a8ab3bf51 but at the same instant several men talking loud and fast began noisily mounting the stairs.
0x42ba6036d54affc4219d06cf814c989cb0fc776b there were three or four of them.
0x339168670c3b124da7459c076b96ccbac63df2d3 he distinguished the ringing voice of the young man.
0xbcefb15dab735b9393add5a25caeaf673e90aebf “hey!”
0x1bc6762c418f830360dd20d8203e2678ade986d0 filled with despair he went straight to meet them, feeling “come what must!”
0xc3a205e43cea94bbb251a8609b96c78a94cc4d80 if they stopped him--all was lost; if they let him pass--all was lost too; they would remember him.
0x838312b80b70f1f2570c8adb67fcbfa46aa4818a they were approaching; they were only a flight from him--and suddenly deliverance!
0x4f774ae01f3719e9eb65fd34f409cf5093eefa39 a few steps from him on the right, there was an empty flat with the door wide open, the flat on the second floor where the painters had been at work, and which, as though for his benefit, they had just left.
0x151ea6af1eab307d0f4de0a844f60ec3693502b1 it was they, no doubt, who had just run down, shouting.
0x2d04c61e8e10aa83359190a8b435823114f12199 the floor had only just been painted, in the middle of the room stood a pail and a broken pot with paint and brushes.
0xf8752e0202c1590d8effbbf00b61b643c34a0557 in one instant he had whisked in at the open door and hidden behind the wall and only in the nick of time; they had already reached the landing.
0xc5514d99c74eeb299278200827a796a32e2a3476 then they turned and went on up to the fourth floor, talking loudly.
0xa42c66145282d1a46faf44173fa018624db4847d he waited, went out on tiptoe and ran down the stairs.
0x717ab419b4a7073ddf7555beeb4a628e2f1404a6 no one was on the stairs, nor in the gateway.
0x6f4cbf6be8116242c3bdee7a3e44a28ff57457e3 he passed quickly through the gateway and turned to the left in the street.
0x36c589278071bfe79be66f0ea9c45b587e7660d5 he knew, he knew perfectly well that at that moment they were at the flat, that they were greatly astonished at finding it unlocked, as the door had just been fastened, that by now they were looking at the bodies, that before another minute had passed they would guess and completely realise that the murderer had just been there, and had succeeded in hiding somewhere, slipping by them and escaping.
0xf4351f9a4bd3b89f2b6c2f96aa194004736a4831 they would guess most likely that he had been in the empty flat, while they were going upstairs.
0x3caef498c187b833c7395110e2d41b01d74e5f6c and meanwhile he dared not quicken his pace much, though the next turning was still nearly a hundred yards away.
0x857eeb4e1384dd64dd57d0ed6f784003c7d1ddaf “should he slip through some gateway and wait somewhere in an unknown street?
0x7aaf38f4678735cd4cb615b510042d76292ecb1a no, hopeless!
0x49196ce2c68e8d7dacd1b45d187fc7fa245e9ad9 should he fling away the axe?
0x981c72fb34506831db74c42a498b42c0201f8ee4 should he take a cab?
0x2fa458912a01e591051a0d668f8ddaa881b46e00 hopeless, hopeless!”
0x24007538eb3a698f8281e83e6b695d8f3946579a at last he reached the turning.
0x026cb8140b83c5bd126b2648f8fece1a76038e08 he turned down it more dead than alive.
0x87a53dbe791c3a16ee411e247f7a113afd116685 here he was half way to safety, and he understood it; it was less risky because there was a great crowd of people, and he was lost in it like a grain of sand.
0xdfa79affd1a8f30f5fbef30d91f6228ff34e0cc2 but all he had suffered had so weakened him that he could scarcely move.
0x98e0842347d1c39812be886deb9e5d222868d7fa perspiration ran down him in drops, his neck was all wet.
0xd48353b397b8f0eea5df42ec8e24c782ccf105cf “my word, he has been going it!”
0x7f3dff0fde3382242fae075e0f763e50ca2958a9 someone shouted at him when he came out on the canal bank.
0xba7e039629c0bda423ab2899cd0e26060becc808 he was only dimly conscious of himself now, and the farther he went the worse it was.
0xb857753e808f02f9c2a7b39d010717e84b460fda he remembered however, that on coming out on to the canal bank, he was alarmed at finding few people there and so being more conspicuous, and he had thought of turning back.
0x6e686c115d5220d501e51646b4c15fc3eba94a51 though he was almost falling from fatigue, he went a long way round so as to get home from quite a different direction.
0xb92171da3b07cd3d48188874ba4886e4fe315d6b he was not fully conscious when he passed through the gateway of his house!
0xd2654b1d39dcce431b893167a3553ef771b97f83 he was already on the staircase before he recollected the axe.
0x9e44b42302bf343dceed5db8218300b670b7cab9 and yet he had a very grave problem before him, to put it back and to escape observation as far as possible in doing so.
0x80fadf5ae3cea8198055d5cabc3334155fe361bd he was of course incapable of reflecting that it might perhaps be far better not to restore the axe at all, but to drop it later on in somebody’s yard.
0xec37e398776b554c58885946debc50669b9e9ec3 but it all happened fortunately, the door of the porter’s room was closed but not locked, so that it seemed most likely that the porter was at home.
0xf0f887c4beb72af14e24ccad0227e39f51ea497a but he had so completely lost all power of reflection that he walked straight to the door and opened it.
0x85f699f2b5b24768dcd2dfcae9223bb61b0603bc if the porter had asked him, “what do you want?”
0x9464fd0580b326f96316e10e78a1ddc7d4bd8e2e he would perhaps have simply handed him the axe.
0x07122b8baa1c507a01a86922b0fd274a26de4404 but again the porter was not at home, and he succeeded in putting the axe back under the bench, and even covering it with the chunk of wood as before.
0x0c628986d18c226ff9d514ec1effe9bea4cf8afd he met no one, not a soul, afterwards on the way to his room; the landlady’s door was shut.
0x4b06ce3688d837419cb09fff4774c152987555fb when he was in his room, he flung himself on the sofa just as he was--he did not sleep, but sank into blank forgetfulness.
0x32f60981f2c52a65807d2e461d15a109d64dcb71 if anyone had come into his room then, he would have jumped up at once and screamed.
0x4f7cee2f5813bdbbf45a81c6a8e5ff48eaeb10fd scraps and shreds of thoughts were simply swarming in his brain, but he could not catch at one, he could not rest on one, in spite of all his efforts.... part ii chapter i so he lay a very long while.
0x469d5d38aa6b2e3c213ff60d3b2615d6269f90eb now and then he seemed to wake up, and at such moments he noticed that it was far into the night, but it did not occur to him to get up.
0x7bf63f386b9dd2117052b736bd5f3ed684060d75 at last he noticed that it was beginning to get light.
0xfe91f126d1acc4d7e7dd2aff2517f4bfab2298b2 he was lying on his back, still dazed from his recent oblivion.
0xc90390356a15a180618ee7b007cd75bb2730bba1 fearful, despairing cries rose shrilly from the street, sounds which he heard every night, indeed, under his window after two o’clock.
0x0acd929eb77a4e176bd3cdb108ed4f426fb51d45 they woke him up now.
0x91ba30ea764a7db34ef0508ffb30ef7a725646ee “ah!
0x4c8fee6d6dda7e4d31faeef350a120f330784a9c the drunken men are coming out of the taverns,” he thought, “it’s past two o’clock,” and at once he leaped up, as though someone had pulled him from the sofa.
0xe5223fdb02d9ee9ecf8a04f7116dd98e3afde8a1 “what!
0xb7c904339893b7e4b17f91aa361f2db14c404a74 past two o’clock!”
0x13182c78555f49e8a563c39f547f78275d5673fd he sat down on the sofa--and instantly recollected everything!
0x05a870d352d71759050a9b9c96e89075c6eca5ba all at once, in one flash, he recollected everything.
0x7962686ebaae03aa8b9bc3fbea5da00e7b450b24 for the first moment he thought he was going mad.
0x82d1bfeb463172c7fcfb74a9090e8515971c8a1c a dreadful chill came over him; but the chill was from the fever that had begun long before in his sleep.
0x5ba07a5f9601547840d9ccb0a82497bfb4840183 now he was suddenly taken with violent shivering, so that his teeth chattered and all his limbs were shaking.
0x55b0cb82feff7d626bd1fd309859e43448d63e17 he opened the door and began listening--everything in the house was asleep.
0xffc72891df0f2431afb8effec8c37ef88d52c6c6 with amazement he gazed at himself and everything in the room around him, wondering how he could have come in the night before without fastening the door, and have flung himself on the sofa without undressing, without even taking his hat off.
0xcf4cc3134e22b10bbff6f33a6af5aee15c97a35f it had fallen off and was lying on the floor near his pillow.
0x39324aa3e761db366a420115c743dc2a31735f81 “if anyone had come in, what would he have thought?
0x0a658ada0dc2be2200a648cd7d4a2b3e7fcbc5da that i’m drunk but...” he rushed to the window.
0xd4ad8ba61f439557d353e7377edb7414cf1f3d76 there was light enough, and he began hurriedly looking himself all over from head to foot, all his clothes; were there no traces?
0x1d0b418f2d6d99a66669d4e3c3225a0aabffb51c but there was no doing it like that; shivering with cold, he began taking off everything and looking over again.
0xfa6bec2b510898d70752197759f0eaaa2db3fb5d he turned everything over to the last threads and rags, and mistrusting himself, went through his search three times.
0x84b45fb43076ead32d77ea23c25bb2ce7b97b434 but there seemed to be nothing, no trace, except in one place, where some thick drops of congealed blood were clinging to the frayed edge of his trousers.
0x5304480c6589c8a68b15110e777a40aac885db66 he picked up a big claspknife and cut off the frayed threads.
0x7d87d5471178feb51312ab548e0fa573f3f3d5d9 there seemed to be nothing more.
0x4ca99f49bcd8d23fef44136408834361e83dacac suddenly he remembered that the purse and the things he had taken out of the old woman’s box were still in his pockets!
0xa1e051ad786583ba8473a055992e9e3d162527c6 he had not thought till then of taking them out and hiding them!
0x92a7a69584c9500788aaa096df421a650d60004b he had not even thought of them while he was examining his clothes!
0xd3696e1b23ef242cbffc04c36bfb5a50ef2746f3 what next?
0x95a8635ff0e87e8ce5340ef23b4c0223cb2d054d instantly he rushed to take them out and fling them on the table.
0xa403d86020fa6fce1c213e62ab1c5f583b6c6e0d when he had pulled out everything, and turned the pocket inside out to be sure there was nothing left, he carried the whole heap to the corner.
0x4affedb05b65d03ac6ee55d43baa920142e346d6 the paper had come off the bottom of the wall and hung there in tatters.
0xd290644c6352f578c7d878626035c0edfc8c8709 he began stuffing all the things into the hole under the paper: “they’re in!
0xf2bb488bf3145162e341b731a9fa36bda64c24f5 all out of sight, and the purse too!”
0xa309cf4089555b72317ccafd9c0b4d6796bcaf8a he thought gleefully, getting up and gazing blankly at the hole which bulged out more than ever.
0xe4d20cfe174f8a5ef84b86c0812c48a8c7dd1dc1 suddenly he shuddered all over with horror; “my god!”
0xe3d7ca5583cc6458cedba942f9bbfdb69181acfc he whispered in despair: “what’s the matter with me?
0xe8bfb90e1c72f6d2aab9891d61353428d5e494df is that hidden?
0xc17c9c6cb64caa31ad5d9168f33b8f2e641c4a02 is that the way to hide things?”
0xd119b1c148a8465242171299ed9e7b0a285c1bfb he had not reckoned on having trinkets to hide.
0xbf2de927a605c27e8b181ee80ed39d6f0aa4b5c4 he had only thought of money, and so had not prepared a hiding-place.
0xa632eea373396188a578f94d36b47579a318eabd “but now, now, what am i glad of?”
0x6042bac423f42b14660296549283d73d5f93dcaf he thought, “is that hiding things?
0x0c695ce64781f285d217c143a36c52cfb805c464 my reason’s deserting me--simply!”
0x03a5e861ae07548892316da7015457a44c571217 he sat down on the sofa in exhaustion and was at once shaken by another unbearable fit of shivering.
0x3db6519481893d8f9b84a96682a59430165bd8d2 mechanically he drew from a chair beside him his old student’s winter coat, which was still warm though almost in rags, covered himself up with it and once more sank into drowsiness and delirium.
0x820c7152093a46d63578f470121c299a30db70f8 he lost consciousness.
0x65f3ee54b001c0d861aa8f7b1f89cc4f20868e20 not more than five minutes had passed when he jumped up a second time, and at once pounced in a frenzy on his clothes again.
0x65afd558e4de228e7d8c79bccac694b39d664090 “how could i go to sleep again with nothing done?
0xf72822aad6610f520ea9cfb12fa598c8f580c999 yes, yes; i have not taken the loop off the armhole!
0x818bc86984ca892bba5a6aee5cc40592b4bb3cf4 i forgot it, forgot a thing like that!
0x168960da0f5ae6114006500917f48a92ade29c7c such a piece of evidence!”
0xc30f8eedfc0f84d058dc8c0d1eab20e3863e227c he pulled off the noose, hurriedly cut it to pieces and threw the bits among his linen under the pillow.
0xac8190976e1aa90f77e40c87d0c9498f33c939c4 “pieces of torn linen couldn’t rouse suspicion, whatever happened; i think not, i think not, any way!”
0x380a3c80085aa1da779874e97373554cb42fd18e he repeated, standing in the middle of the room, and with painful concentration he fell to gazing about him again, at the floor and everywhere, trying to make sure he had not forgotten anything.
0xd696a777cd9070cb22fa67977ea18c39fffeb926 the conviction that all his faculties, even memory, and the simplest power of reflection were failing him, began to be an insufferable torture.
0xb60e0bac1460cb2f759a728a9e5e78d7df54439c “surely it isn’t beginning already!
0xd4e0a4aaa70b6b96faba4397cedc53c871518db4 surely it isn’t my punishment coming upon me?
0x39c56d5c06cabddbc0bff2db5ad5bda70dbbef2f it is!”
0x874a98b1de87c805f0e4c8041b3185c8f06ecfd7 the frayed rags he had cut off his trousers were actually lying on the floor in the middle of the room, where anyone coming in would see them!
0xf8dfcf740250abb3f4bb763fc5011bd017ff5f2c “what is the matter with me!”
0xba0968d9bd4f0d4376783dca814c818e51c19f1e he cried again, like one distraught.
0x7499ae7c2644ef52cf453c8990e30ac1cf7bc26a then a strange idea entered his head; that, perhaps, all his clothes were covered with blood, that, perhaps, there were a great many stains, but that he did not see them, did not notice them because his perceptions were failing, were going to pieces... his reason was clouded.... suddenly he remembered that there had been blood on the purse too.
0x91ba30ea764a7db34ef0508ffb30ef7a725646ee “ah!
0xee81898e765f622d3d14edbd6f4e80e8ae80034d then there must be blood on the pocket too, for i put the wet purse in my pocket!”
0x06798b3de668a91e82fb3c20f00819a9d5d9a17f in a flash he had turned the pocket inside out and, yes!--there were traces, stains on the lining of the pocket!
0xcc5b896033afd71ed84d4cef9ce78031ae913772 “so my reason has not quite deserted me, so i still have some sense and memory, since i guessed it of myself,” he thought triumphantly, with a deep sigh of relief; “it’s simply the weakness of fever, a moment’s delirium,” and he tore the whole lining out of the left pocket of his trousers.
0x3de4f9dd000e58c43fd8c77137ea1c77c591cf88 at that instant the sunlight fell on his left boot; on the sock which poked out from the boot, he fancied there were traces!
0x4e4e595428cb754e894be8167fc512f59becfd92 he flung off his boots; “traces indeed!
0x811d2ab12d87cc8bd85cb1aa8c11e171c9ed4923 the tip of the sock was soaked with blood;” he must have unwarily stepped into that pool.... “but what am i to do with this now?
0x33692fdf8ed53f06e4662b2588af3fbd14381cd4 where am i to put the sock and rags and pocket?”
0x5ec1929150c4db8991e2b5cbc2f089474c9f263f he gathered them all up in his hands and stood in the middle of the room.
0xdde0fcd533cf539f611b685baeb648845f2c6e95 “in the stove?
0x988da6f5b267f10ab612dee2eb01100059921c1a but they would ransack the stove first of all.
0xedf127c29e098118f6c57eabb00c1b8f275a6048 burn them?
0x0bca2dd14ac6f0eeee71f0347545d3ce8d17bc2f but what can i burn them with?
0x8027a1a3c2d9ed563a268331f6e168f587cc44ca there are no matches even.
0x23323227218fff41b898e590976cbcb2f509af63 no, better go out and throw it all away somewhere.
0xedfc7f4ae2f06c404f7b60796b41329d53fbf1c1 yes, better throw it away,” he repeated, sitting down on the sofa again, “and at once, this minute, without lingering...” but his head sank on the pillow instead.
0xcf03142f8f3f8c8244d5d968a933781a0c9ebdfd again the unbearable icy shivering came over him; again he drew his coat over him.
0x21eb092eb7e4ba3d06a2f436c1df8214f4f85ca2 and for a long while, for some hours, he was haunted by the impulse to “go off somewhere at once, this moment, and fling it all away, so that it may be out of sight and done with, at once, at once!”
0x5699b36ed478694296c93e6e5d5f4b4c09c8c255 several times he tried to rise from the sofa, but could not.
0x65f6fc4044e4f87ee96f9c858b867572589af069 he was thoroughly waked up at last by a violent knocking at his door.
0xd787107b61d01289cae8d8f1f64ffdec32c16154 “open, do, are you dead or alive?
0xba092a269d0ab1099fee173b7df5e8ede16c3f8d he keeps sleeping here!”
0xfe9bba51e7b5d329c454c71e5c18ad9e15ae7bc3 shouted nastasya, banging with her fist on the door.
0xbe790352a3faf10f4dd505441412e9269ed305f4 “for whole days together he’s snoring here like a dog!
0xa7ae144c98e74c7d08ce2ad09c7472d1d6d22b44 a dog he is too.

0x9a4c9906291cab346444a25c617c7a4c749bf973 “maybe he’s not at home,” said a man’s voice.
0xb42f7cecfd9344690a679950241832788e445f5a “ha!
0x157c29032424e25479d2d2167c7ee07f0374838a that’s the porter’s voice.... what does he want?”
0x6ad68153014142ca42b431da0c415c46575c534b he jumped up and sat on the sofa.
0x3fde40aeb499c58dfbd8020197cb96693990344b the beating of his heart was a positive pain.
0xbd145ae223ac750e95201e5b2dc04c6f61657af1 “then who can have latched the door?”
0x458f4caf3a17d13030afff48aa5c5465739ed3ff retorted nastasya.
0xe94b7bcad86ecb556c755cc30aca614ef482f92d “he’s taken to bolting himself in!
0x54f262b663c7976f6a71d05be9956c0af964232d as if he were worth stealing!

0x8dcc2826c87a5febe369feb340088adf569df320 “what do they want?

0x51f005a98d2df51776b208e8800e0ddfc611dc61 he half rose, stooped forward and unlatched the door.
0x86f545fd385bd7df8322b4f243396dad513d4ddc his room was so small that he could undo the latch without leaving the bed.
0xe62c1302af704b305266c2279cd3dc12d5af24ca yes; the porter and nastasya were standing there.
0xd41af0a502f325f1a8e6efa36a1384c067d31de8 nastasya stared at him in a strange way.
0x29279e35b1499a64a9df7deb389eb2f2a23cc193 he glanced with a defiant and desperate air at the porter, who without a word held out a grey folded paper sealed with bottle-wax.
0xeb8bdaaea4719095b164126234a9ec9b37136c56 “a notice from the office,” he announced, as he gave him the paper.
0xd4a17b2a5bc649b67f1f3ffec82e3aa6a5c627a4 “from what office?”
0x842c836bff90c20f51c47c892a83638f6bbc2b82 “a summons to the police office, of course.

0xc215523236ada9e3e88d7c8bd269beb6404c7700 “to the police?... what for?...”
0xc3908619d0e624b0ebc7a50fa189761cb60715a0 “how can i tell?
0x467f7410718ec044a2358ae961c693b58c86e464 you’re sent for, so you go.”
0x45ecaf208f782c9d258618f9b338e236b0b3cdbc the man looked at him attentively, looked round the room and turned to go away.
0xa5c97630f41fa03a3f8774bcba655f665f616d33 “he’s downright ill!”
0x3e4c801822261cd43ea97258ed73b02fc3e1770c observed nastasya, not taking her eyes off him.
0x94000daaf39b1b0d6489de65c5020086bb7a1a16 the porter turned his head for a moment.
0x180bb045e15596e83d359d09c1fd745659cdf1ae “he’s been in a fever since yesterday,” she added.
0x1edc9e9f24d4e21989474633e580edf104dbc118 raskolnikov made no response and held the paper in his hands, without opening it.
0x365ac5f5a714f2cd2f6a5954ce2fba418e5769c5 “don’t you get up then,” nastasya went on compassionately, seeing that he was letting his feet down from the sofa.
0x6cddf222efec8f2c0a4ce8e7d762c2097e727312 “you’re ill, and so don’t go; there’s no such hurry.
0xd3b736c63809d876b64fa38740a4ef8efa95bbde what have you got there?”
0xcc96da815219b304dce7bb4dd1cd691662b53325 he looked; in his right hand he held the shreds he had cut from his trousers, the sock, and the rags of the pocket.
0x4902db846508c2513bc1c1badc8d7b5cb6888226 so he had been asleep with them in his hand.
0x523a8952a186a8495b42b26ba2b6bdf01085f919 afterwards reflecting upon it, he remembered that half waking up in his fever, he had grasped all this tightly in his hand and so fallen asleep again.
0xe95a9ef3c1b4264cd2fc4a347e777399a959178f “look at the rags he’s collected and sleeps with them, as though he has got hold of a treasure...” and nastasya went off into her hysterical giggle.
0xb3b76026f84a876618f514512f1c3cf7c4a81ac0 instantly he thrust them all under his great coat and fixed his eyes intently upon her.
0x8fceb2805f5e554dc1cd5968ac425ab0d88183ad far as he was from being capable of rational reflection at that moment, he felt that no one would behave like that with a person who was going to be arrested.
0x74836f3a74e098dbc81032a12128e804b85d145d “but... the police?”
0xe10e4a2098eb394d1e693ce53d105348ebada80d “you’d better have some tea!
0x806968b9546aab772405ab0f022212701632166a yes?
0xc5f64a322dfca40bdf895edea65636bd103f2312 i’ll bring it, there’s some left.”
0xc72d4ceb99c765f84bd7eaad8e613ef0e2b82d36 “no... i’m going; i’ll go at once,” he muttered, getting on to his feet.
0x62d418eca8d31a09d632d9b0117a8fb5f914f5c0 “why, you’ll never get downstairs!”
0x9726b81d90eb6b8763ea89320b83ca81dad23e33 “yes, i’ll go.”
0x98fcc1518ff810931d0284e07565ece844c8562a “as you please.”
0x950c3f6657061af3fb7c0ad15560110cbcd7a51f she followed the porter out.
0xe1dd6fe209c5fa5b0eab6f0867d488930018b3ec at once he rushed to the light to examine the sock and the rags.
0x768e8d9589bb9748945c36d7ab6d97ec02b1673a “there are stains, but not very noticeable; all covered with dirt, and rubbed and already discoloured.
0x9cf0d546fc3c571ef341ca4ef05282ce7b19741f no one who had no suspicion could distinguish anything.
0xd1c443e7b94e474eeac27903d481379f3301d158 nastasya from a distance could not have noticed, thank god!”
0xabb2231410702d9232eb92ade62cecbaf816fdac then with a tremor he broke the seal of the notice and began reading; he was a long while reading, before he understood.
0x2a7d518a6c115c4d6ff2a8a980daf7b2da11ae54 it was an ordinary summons from the district police-station to appear that day at half-past nine at the office of the district superintendent.
0x1a1aa494a15a4a963428da65c23be3bbeeeaf0ed “but when has such a thing happened?
0x10e135f296658d2caa8a102d95ca956174a3e1da i never have anything to do with the police!
0x07f09382b6cd0139bb4f9001f06a34d06ce55f98 and why just to-day?”
0x47ce4010d5fe2c8805ca63295a584bb266242231 he thought in agonising bewilderment.
0xaf9f875adfd2c0c2f5eb7a4378054571cb120870 “good god, only get it over soon!”
0xd07dea13a2c0e862f7410a2796a35ce5b2443986 he was flinging himself on his knees to pray, but broke into laughter--not at the idea of prayer, but at himself.
0xc6b2c88ac187b286864a030be2c6999457138c96 he began, hurriedly dressing.
0x1f343134e3a27f4926e2ee726b3b040347643f80 “if i’m lost, i am lost, i don’t care!
0x0c135f9f82f7c64c8710ca544e242c32caf1fdd7 shall i put the sock on?”
0x01a1363fd3d92a76d8e656e14a8b5943c6915d50 he suddenly wondered, “it will get dustier still and the traces will be gone.”
0xf25f0ad3ccd9faeb12b2adb994973543f0451cee but no sooner had he put it on than he pulled it off again in loathing and horror.
0x905b0210b75bcec9ce60e43b02f417f4c9c163b7 he pulled it off, but reflecting that he had no other socks, he picked it up and put it on again--and again he laughed.
0xbe4f2b6ccd3bf4e45f0e9b6aaed072c9498eefe3 “that’s all conventional, that’s all relative, merely a way of looking at it,” he thought in a flash, but only on the top surface of his mind, while he was shuddering all over, “there, i’ve got it on!
0xa053b544b14d3431d4f75c8b49dd7355d59a57f6 i have finished by getting it on!”
0x78f09e0c0bdc70b03fa036ac03bcfaf03f099a00 but his laughter was quickly followed by despair.
0xe6c1e564d7e750d3ea948c214153183516ec77b5 “no, it’s too much for me...” he thought.
0x66e046b4495761b12e998831b085abe30f759803 his legs shook.
0x35e07cba7c3f94e3b51864bbdcfe78d8406e0638 “from fear,” he muttered.
0x47f95cb3e243b8ce11329928c3d17f7d0fa53e2a his head swam and ached with fever.
0xa2dec41f33135723b9c56fb100395426db3f2f87 “it’s a trick!
0xbdb43224a9d435f6e1d2eaf0ee1a2f2185280588 they want to decoy me there and confound me over everything,” he mused, as he went out on to the stairs--“the worst of it is i’m almost light-headed... i may blurt out something stupid...” on the stairs he remembered that he was leaving all the things just as they were in the hole in the wall, “and very likely, it’s on purpose to search when i’m out,” he thought, and stopped short.
0xd20843c4f408f66818ac2d67fcef07f8dbe6af06 but he was possessed by such despair, such cynicism of misery, if one may so call it, that with a wave of his hand he went on.
0x63b385214ae12c18db16805a4bc9a7c804f28cf0 “only to get it over!”
0x3c46bc5c83e008d603486997e60839f3860b3df8 in the street the heat was insufferable again; not a drop of rain had fallen all those days.
0x8f460dae9a933376257ce7f2e780902927210701 again dust, bricks and mortar, again the stench from the shops and pot-houses, again the drunken men, the finnish pedlars and half-broken-down cabs.
0x49c28c7c22cc26bb6a01de355c265108e1899d91 the sun shone straight in his eyes, so that it hurt him to look out of them, and he felt his head going round--as a man in a fever is apt to feel when he comes out into the street on a bright sunny day.
0x6fade36eac7e08657a0eb8e42023b3fdc2f87820 when he reached the turning into _the_ street, in an agony of trepidation he looked down it... at _the_ house... and at once averted his eyes.
0x1cbf678a6b6a498966e95018e7ac1332858c161f “if they question me, perhaps i’ll simply tell,” he thought, as he drew near the police-station.
0x56a1664ef17c2c48cff5bc44260fd04689fee27b the police-station was about a quarter of a mile off.
0x168dcf25270dcac81ef38b8ae404706499d917d4 it had lately been moved to new rooms on the fourth floor of a new house.
0xb27ae30cee9536ef79f00a60a9fa894d5fdd6e59 he had been once for a moment in the old office but long ago.
0x5bc8e98bf1b899ebc315a1cc597ab3c8a5528125 turning in at the gateway, he saw on the right a flight of stairs which a peasant was mounting with a book in his hand.
0x6fe7923bc54f8f7022d586e4ab9cee0d87933331 “a house-porter, no doubt; so then, the office is here,” and he began ascending the stairs on the chance.
0x739a1e549e24f70ea6fcbec6caadb3a77d448581 he did not want to ask questions of anyone.
0x49d9a2ed84f6126e6c3ba8b170a98b74fe5e66cb “i’ll go in, fall on my knees, and confess everything...” he thought, as he reached the fourth floor.
0x769e23096e08d7599fc8a1ee3ba3969af2c4820f the staircase was steep, narrow and all sloppy with dirty water.
0x8b056d06c2f15a7e114a401bbf2f23dd22076e86 the kitchens of the flats opened on to the stairs and stood open almost the whole day.
0x4552671d0e1987f989527ff39aff125cbc77c0bc so there was a fearful smell and heat.
0x6a826a42a7fd21f2719c5e6a5307400a3651c4ec the staircase was crowded with porters going up and down with their books under their arms, policemen, and persons of all sorts and both sexes.
0x47dede2047a968f1fce1ed810de6ea7b3980d947 the door of the office, too, stood wide open.
0xdb4033ffec13ae494ccffe211901b55b949231df peasants stood waiting within.
0xcd33ad0f50e1e0d5e7f5c88f0e9e0cd6e0434374 there, too, the heat was stifling and there was a sickening smell of fresh paint and stale oil from the newly decorated rooms.
0x212707010638012f97577e7f1c43e5647f0bbc1f after waiting a little, he decided to move forward into the next room.
0xbf5ffce5e2a185a75952e5b8986053d3f69ca26d all the rooms were small and low-pitched.
0xa894e336c8b0526adb25b151bc47c7ec9a987d05 a fearful impatience drew him on and on.
0x4cf9df2b605eb3f13e4622c087b2df32a8766b7a no one paid attention to him.
0xffdfc75afc99e0fb06007be1bdfd840d48cdbe4e in the second room some clerks sat writing, dressed hardly better than he was, and rather a queer-looking set.
0x818f90270a986538f778bb7cb53b608a4b682dfe he went up to one of them.
0xf7421ecf93fec117c5974f6568bf915fd84f7750 “what is it?”
0x2a6d9d59d4962f7b5649a7811ba43561c47fc43b he showed the notice he had received.
0x6ac07dc656580b985f44eea937e3114d485e7e77 “you are a student?”
0x7ba2488d78c7587c5ece67fa65aebd5b69dc565b the man asked, glancing at the notice.
0xc681bacb8c9b3210ee3da86761d4671bfc45fd18 “yes, formerly a student.”
0x52036695b4da9babe331e5124a121862222da392 the clerk looked at him, but without the slightest interest.
0x38b6d23b835ffcae3abb62c5f8a4eb2963d55227 he was a particularly unkempt person with the look of a fixed idea in his eye.
0x3a23b553ecc183f4afa63e95592f2b158c9eb75e “there would be no getting anything out of him, because he has no interest in anything,” thought raskolnikov.
0x98a1af307cd73c807d53da4c262c1331e62029cf “go in there to the head clerk,” said the clerk, pointing towards the furthest room.
0x21a38acb57b5779c3946da5b3625d49730b6c7f2 he went into that room--the fourth in order; it was a small room and packed full of people, rather better dressed than in the outer rooms.
0x3782730a3b275472f0dc4b91a6ca03997ca10612 among them were two ladies.
0xcf5f9026cfbb382daaa5143e78f5c04f741c64f3 one, poorly dressed in mourning, sat at the table opposite the chief clerk, writing something at his dictation.
0xbb5b49a51f550e919bfa916ff37ba1d5337de3fa the other, a very stout, buxom woman with a purplish-red, blotchy face, excessively smartly dressed with a brooch on her bosom as big as a saucer, was standing on one side, apparently waiting for something.
0x3d46f00caba141cac9e2d945c84b807b808e55ef raskolnikov thrust his notice upon the head clerk.
0x66059d1de58c622f9257b894257d3f596e644715 the latter glanced at it, said: “wait a minute,” and went on attending to the lady in mourning.
0x7efd9d18d81add74774d553eea4009acca19ba22 he breathed more freely.
0x0df649a1dc9d68f98a97992fb1748c4b00cb5f13 “it can’t be that!”
0xc2b99fe73608311c9841a7d654481b9decc030d6 by degrees he began to regain confidence, he kept urging himself to have courage and be calm.
0xb06ea016d5490df24115643be67e6bfbbc8fa470 “some foolishness, some trifling carelessness, and i may betray myself!
0xffc430ee9554c469f6d41558514776fd2267c130 hm... it’s a pity there’s no air here,” he added, “it’s stifling.... it makes one’s head dizzier than ever... and one’s mind too...” he was conscious of a terrible inner turmoil.
0x6e28afe6d1305a2d2ae6b0519b5163bcbf7d87fd he was afraid of losing his self-control; he tried to catch at something and fix his mind on it, something quite irrelevant, but he could not succeed in this at all.
0xf8de60c99de85ebc3f60917ed6903141096e9768 yet the head clerk greatly interested him, he kept hoping to see through him and guess something from his face.
0x57fc4a3d283b3eb77cea3c4a40eb37e71114465c he was a very young man, about two and twenty, with a dark mobile face that looked older than his years.
0xca13407b47cabdd3203ca4b4ba7114addf7e3832 he was fashionably dressed and foppish, with his hair parted in the middle, well combed and pomaded, and wore a number of rings on his well-scrubbed fingers and a gold chain on his waistcoat.
0xf7da3883ab63e7cd47555bde77ab9d20103ac38f he said a couple of words in french to a foreigner who was in the room, and said them fairly correctly.
0xd940f915317ea4b7d3d5433769555237350d98ee “luise ivanovna, you can sit down,” he said casually to the gaily-dressed, purple-faced lady, who was still standing as though not venturing to sit down, though there was a chair beside her.
0x1ebe57eb1679c379d5ac2d05e0d009fa77d700f1 “ich danke,” said the latter, and softly, with a rustle of silk she sank into the chair.
0x41a5913904a79a52ed35a80253d67d14f774e9bd her light blue dress trimmed with white lace floated about the table like an air-balloon and filled almost half the room.
0x22ffa57931ef3953d6f84dd81c9172cdc8f8eccd she smelt of scent.
0xb02bd3162bbb49e422af4d16edd22ec7e333c05c but she was obviously embarrassed at filling half the room and smelling so strongly of scent; and though her smile was impudent as well as cringing, it betrayed evident uneasiness.
0x0b3793dfb82421e75450fabe6f5e73970657478e the lady in mourning had done at last, and got up.
0xaf8666362ba6efdcfc10869b47d7a1b3901fccbb all at once, with some noise, an officer walked in very jauntily, with a peculiar swing of his shoulders at each step.
0x9e1c77f6d0d5d0c391330c0a7e662a1c05647e39 he tossed his cockaded cap on the table and sat down in an easy-chair.
0x60994a40520e9b7079e8dc0a8bbc023876b5388a the small lady positively skipped from her seat on seeing him, and fell to curtsying in a sort of ecstasy; but the officer took not the smallest notice of her, and she did not venture to sit down again in his presence.
0xe2e4027a94039447e9b16635453d6aa20ef1a220 he was the assistant superintendent.
0x5df6e0fddf17b6f939a5ac0000611d46c3ab4867 he had a reddish moustache that stood out horizontally on each side of his face, and extremely small features, expressive of nothing much except a certain insolence.
0xd9b4beb583aca269ec9a39467c133aadeea7ebdd he looked askance and rather indignantly at raskolnikov; he was so very badly dressed, and in spite of his humiliating position, his bearing was by no means in keeping with his clothes.
0x0e39462cc1e537db46911edaaf1537e40a1205d3 raskolnikov had unwarily fixed a very long and direct look on him, so that he felt positively affronted.
0x721ede191520c07dca21bffcf2c4a846f673e300 “what do you want?”
0x84d30abaa98f90dce3a0bd0985863171ae244495 he shouted, apparently astonished that such a ragged fellow was not annihilated by the majesty of his glance.
0xf85f757224aed70fa0067e5b439fc14dfb9246bf “i was summoned... by a notice...” raskolnikov faltered.
0x2f03ecaeb55f95fe3d5528b04cb0f752e5d5a1ca “for the recovery of money due, from _the student_,” the head clerk interfered hurriedly, tearing himself from his papers.
0x57321c27b32a6469ddc1c30853fde8ee5f74c82a “here!”
0x60c2e1eef6fe306b57f7ac82a7c2a62f20a4bbd0 and he flung raskolnikov a document and pointed out the place.
0xa8fb356d5d7ad4d946549b0621420017de7252a5 “read that!”
0x633e5da5f4241fc65fec765f7f4af4fb05c81279 “money?
0x3e95e3669210dbf00a0dbbb22659d52eb41bffdd what money?”
0x68628c03efb848f17167427c21a6b7a03f607de7 thought raskolnikov, “but... then... it’s certainly not _that_.”
0x7d0d97496e3ecbfb224f26b0286c6e65b2ac8758 and he trembled with joy.
0x6f252f0366d2dfadf54595d13789288c5ecb256e he felt sudden intense indescribable relief.
0x301d66d1ef7c4d1562aec76038e8dabd9cac466f a load was lifted from his back.
0xf3f218e92900b7d7af35719dce1d82c14f92f98b “and pray, what time were you directed to appear, sir?”
0x4648e27cf3bba98d26282ea0c967d5d5312c1cad shouted the assistant superintendent, seeming for some unknown reason more and more aggrieved.
0xd954d51352520da699f029f528e55329820f6ac8 “you are told to come at nine, and now it’s twelve!”
0xc3bac75fe86c280b7a71de01c36cdea3b1191d18 “the notice was only brought me a quarter of an hour ago,” raskolnikov answered loudly over his shoulder.
0x7d77d456954f824cfbb9c88f5daba376fdd55c2f to his own surprise he, too, grew suddenly angry and found a certain pleasure in it.
0xa70d0c5e1ada357075e8b60fe45f134a33867219 “and it’s enough that i have come here ill with fever.”

0x9e119eda7954def0dd147603c4749974a5cbc3fc “i’m not shouting, i’m speaking very quietly, it’s you who are shouting at me.
0x57ba7d40bbfcb3407f45f77b63b6b7c2d7b010f1 i’m a student, and allow no one to shout at me.”
0x3b8b5512b1eb7b94b3ef048e7e2c4d11a4cda30a the assistant superintendent was so furious that for the first minute he could only splutter inarticulately.
0xc4349a4603e6a303f14f536127a4469e71acb64e he leaped up from his seat.
0xb174b9cd9e7100a032ca988391e89df469e5bc87 “be silent!
0x07be710a1916a01d9ae1144d7311ec2d08dd1648 you are in a government office.

0xa344dbbd20f15e325784d34c4e20aa8a44dd4363 “you’re in a government office, too,” cried raskolnikov, “and you’re smoking a cigarette as well as shouting, so you are showing disrespect to all of us.”
0x31f7e7edbe48f33d6c2c7baa95a92b8361836156 he felt an indescribable satisfaction at having said this.
0xac1e28010e91ce1fa38573c0125b6e9e8af4fb80 the head clerk looked at him with a smile.
0x1a5629487c30f83ab0891426b45e69af8d6a76a2 the angry assistant superintendent was obviously disconcerted.
0x57acc0802c49d102a1e5593e7b4b5d3235d24955 “that’s not your business!”
0x376fc326588e58efb69834c44fee0fc8cfffde6c he shouted at last with unnatural loudness.

0xa95d1c888cef8ff3e57a886651ada999517f41a6 but raskolnikov was not listening now; he had eagerly clutched at the paper, in haste to find an explanation.
0xc4203eac7532ad270bfc58c8ef7153aec1f952bc he read it once, and a second time, and still did not understand.
0x2b3de17343913a0c95786101538c878b6c9cbf8f “what is this?”
0xaa05016d649eacceca75371caeb063d6e2c434b7 he asked the head clerk.
0xfe5f19289f210f0109d8a13933793d0519e041a5 “it is for the recovery of money on an i o u, a writ.
0x4ecbd989a22f5662d2ee286aef4fe985124f154a you must either pay it, with all expenses, costs and so on, or give a written declaration when you can pay it, and at the same time an undertaking not to leave the capital without payment, and nor to sell or conceal your property.

0x62dcbf7bfe1cbe53f839e9c6374c26a3e09854cc “that’s not our business.
0x966262c1fd98cdd5c0564a093e09b740e4e6a477 here, an i o u for a hundred and fifteen roubles, legally attested, and due for payment, has been brought us for recovery, given by you to the widow of the assessor zarnitsyn, nine months ago, and paid over by the widow zarnitsyn to one mr. tchebarov.
0x4bc53fc32826b31a83722bc160b80c87673986f8 we therefore summon you, hereupon.”
0x6ff65a05182d98b06311f7f0b2bc37909887f73b “but she is my landlady!”
0x6d696525764830660b124ed7dcfb88d7aae158ec “and what if she is your landlady?”
0x3a05f4c5759b0abe74956c66bda267952987e7cf the head clerk looked at him with a condescending smile of compassion, and at the same time with a certain triumph, as at a novice under fire for the first time--as though he would say: “well, how do you feel now?”
0xa80f2ab1c69171619e4be33cd4f77be146fdc3a6 but what did he care now for an i o u, for a writ of recovery!
0x260b21647c469fd93bf291127dceed983a4b5189 was that worth worrying about now, was it worth attention even!
0x0362a8151b4a0006a9645c97794eb8294a0d49ce he stood, he read, he listened, he answered, he even asked questions himself, but all mechanically.
0xbc3b1accb15363b858f73b90fc01135e51a643cc the triumphant sense of security, of deliverance from overwhelming danger, that was what filled his whole soul that moment without thought for the future, without analysis, without suppositions or surmises, without doubts and without questioning.
0x0e553892dc454879169c7d9dc015c4d8b97851e4 it was an instant of full, direct, purely instinctive joy.
0x5e50664954fd83cc169b96b48cda1902cc676e93 but at that very moment something like a thunderstorm took place in the office.
0x40caf0557e8f09954865948a9d88ca80e746753a the assistant superintendent, still shaken by raskolnikov’s disrespect, still fuming and obviously anxious to keep up his wounded dignity, pounced on the unfortunate smart lady, who had been gazing at him ever since he came in with an exceedingly silly smile.
0x637e1b063b853830f3823f1d43ecfec29700d2c6 “you shameful hussy!”
0x5eb5cb75adffccde0445a565295d1df50421bcff he shouted suddenly at the top of his voice.
0xb334a8b53f1209927934639d1df1ec87cec916e3 (the lady in mourning had left the office.)
0x0cc8895a64a04f84cb0182a35cffc5b427914053 “what was going on at your house last night?
0x9108629e1dacaf1b8a7f8fe2987d8d568f658e7d eh!
0x5cbbc770a5510e4c4146ba4112b7ad363d0e8ae2 a disgrace again, you’re a scandal to the whole street.

0xd133e0c5a5c20599909fedf86a2a77925dbf0370 and here you are again, again, you... you...!” the paper fell out of raskolnikov’s hands, and he looked wildly at the smart lady who was so unceremoniously treated.
0x9b6d3315e8bf7fa349b87d9406fa13904c600e71 but he soon saw what it meant, and at once began to find positive amusement in the scandal.
0x6bd621c4bd77bb9e65214c7e6c2591d8df7bba5b he listened with pleasure, so that he longed to laugh and laugh... all his nerves were on edge.
0x41b5c5d23d5d8c0acf0137ca90fd67b4393a6069 “ilya petrovitch!”
0x0ca51c8585d007c359155349a03392ff76f3486a the head clerk was beginning anxiously, but stopped short, for he knew from experience that the enraged assistant could not be stopped except by force.
0xd58abe86295d8ef12b1fb01f5e4062130884ff5d as for the smart lady, at first she positively trembled before the storm.
0x8a7d787d0c459b0ce57e152cc7a3382e3f6c825d but, strange to say, the more numerous and violent the terms of abuse became, the more amiable she looked, and the more seductive the smiles she lavished on the terrible assistant.
0x9b6ef1ad2368cf1c50bbdf5722a0c77fc5fa6897 she moved uneasily, and curtsied incessantly, waiting impatiently for a chance of putting in her word: and at last she found it.
0xdffa9904d7894dd5fc7b2ebfe9b6647c5a70413e “there was no sort of noise or fighting in my house, mr. captain,” she pattered all at once, like peas dropping, speaking russian confidently, though with a strong german accent, “and no sort of scandal, and his honour came drunk, and it’s the whole truth i am telling, mr. captain, and i am not to blame.... mine is an honourable house, mr. captain, and honourable behaviour, mr. captain, and i always, always dislike any scandal myself.
0x85e79273e4d5e3daa7238d4f0c626a6bdb6fc98d but he came quite tipsy, and asked for three bottles again, and then he lifted up one leg, and began playing the pianoforte with one foot, and that is not at all right in an honourable house, and he _ganz_ broke the piano, and it was very bad manners indeed and i said so.
0x12446a60851cf99e9da9c47f75c049c80b75fd31 and he took up a bottle and began hitting everyone with it.
0xa368dd3661fe0c9d8f1a1554fa0999cdb4b3113a and then i called the porter, and karl came, and he took karl and hit him in the eye; and he hit henriette in the eye, too, and gave me five slaps on the cheek.
0x5b1886f312e6bb074ab3a325c30a8c0f6cb70f59 and it was so ungentlemanly in an honourable house, mr. captain, and i screamed.
0xd6a5f56d1c654eb667e9b9ada6ab3922650be343 and he opened the window over the canal, and stood in the window, squealing like a little pig; it was a disgrace.
0x202b570916efabfc6e3aabd269b9686b0669394c the idea of squealing like a little pig at the window into the street!
0x1d338eba57b0bd8a310a2f6313f5ab1db10f17b9 fie upon him!
0x97360d63c062ae50c2ef6a5fdc66f6d1fd24d47e and karl pulled him away from the window by his coat, and it is true, mr. captain, he tore _sein rock_.
0xcb4665945b3b3f75cbc38db059b5074258e0f594 and then he shouted that _man muss_ pay him fifteen roubles damages.
0x5ea51a76d2cd0d911f80f05a664215377cf9c142 and i did pay him, mr. captain, five roubles for _sein rock_.
0xb22bdc4ab51c3ad180b74060da216256cdbdf832 and he is an ungentlemanly visitor and caused all the scandal.
0xe8efc5877b86fded7df3d9bcacdba3bbf2ee511c ‘i will show you up,’ he said, ‘for i can write to all the papers about you.’” “then he was an author?”
0x6eb1b296f9a062cf4dc2bbb11041546c00bc8c1c “yes, mr. captain, and what an ungentlemanly visitor in an honourable house....” “now then!

0x319c9f7fd30a62ceeeb84da9a8a531dc010398d8 the head clerk repeated significantly.
0x9f4a8fe1d6b0a32d9392dbf1940cc1f4535e30ef the assistant glanced rapidly at him; the head clerk slightly shook his head.
0x47cb0eb79ac5cbf05138b0dc0215d27dcd5b2b12 “... so i tell you this, most respectable luise ivanovna, and i tell it you for the last time,” the assistant went on.
0xc396f5030683693068f0b1779642f0cfd8ebcf43 “if there is a scandal in your honourable house once again, i will put you yourself in the lock-up, as it is called in polite society.

0x133373d72a7ee8a2f5b83b1574fc574e94085279 so a literary man, an author took five roubles for his coat-tail in an ‘honourable house’?

0xd74969eaf1788367f9b7b0c5a43037757a05e76c and he cast a contemptuous glance at raskolnikov.
0xc684b6141951c5e2390ebeb18d1f4b68026eb757 “there was a scandal the other day in a restaurant, too.
0x62604543ed9420fb0c70c77d161882b9da6de4c1 an author had eaten his dinner and would not pay; ‘i’ll write a satire on you,’ says he.

0x6c28bc9081384e8bbe9b13e72243aa876e401a0d and there was one of them turned out of a confectioner’s shop the other day.

0xf32b511ebea017eca9455604ba63026d60ed9d5e do you hear?”
0x2585f46d5b9b8fd1729aa5a76c460161bfc3cc73 with hurried deference, luise ivanovna fell to curtsying in all directions, and so curtsied herself to the door.
0x69dd579256f50429ad6ae8e9654ed2433c6eb772 but at the door, she stumbled backwards against a good-looking officer with a fresh, open face and splendid thick fair whiskers.
0x41b799368270b022444119389986ea7dd3924b09 this was the superintendent of the district himself, nikodim fomitch.
0x642429bcfaf6acbc4ce908656bb5838faef1c000 luise ivanovna made haste to curtsy almost to the ground, and with mincing little steps, she fluttered out of the office.

0x642d50d39c196ed9423bae780ba38bc1afd73470 said nikodim fomitch to ilya petrovitch in a civil and friendly tone.

0xec4a07b837069f95901455d3c2f356ca5f0523fe “well, what then!”
0xff81048e7f9cd8dd43c26ffe687720c4200d77ea ilya petrovitch drawled with gentlemanly nonchalance; and he walked with some papers to another table, with a jaunty swing of his shoulders at each step.
0xd7a646c0621ef61acfa5a592419429c5ca088bfc “here, if you will kindly look: an author, or a student, has been one at least, does not pay his debts, has given an i o u, won’t clear out of his room, and complaints are constantly being lodged against him, and here he has been pleased to make a protest against my smoking in his presence!
0x79f8d70aec8c0fdadfdacbfbe5dd72557097706c he behaves like a cad himself, and just look at him, please.

0x29dc20896b001090de45ef04853f3548efc87f62 “poverty is not a vice, my friend, but we know you go off like powder, you can’t bear a slight, i daresay you took offence at something and went too far yourself,” continued nikodim fomitch, turning affably to raskolnikov.
0xab660d9cf4f5dc684d22356b14c9f0b38022b632 “but you were wrong there; he is a capital fellow, i assure you, but explosive, explosive!

0xa05068559f7fb217ef92774081deee483b48f34c raskolnikov had a sudden desire to say something exceptionally pleasant to them all.
0x407def20131032b071d8d4ff4feb3da4d284726c “excuse me, captain,” he began easily, suddenly addressing nikodim fomitch, “will you enter into my position?... i am ready to ask pardon, if i have been ill-mannered.
0x4cc321c42b389158f146e4667442069a79313e83 i am a poor student, sick and shattered (shattered was the word he used) by poverty.

0x112dd3100aad02ea684ba2f3212be8ada2a13499 but allow me to explain...” raskolnikov put in again, still addressing nikodim fomitch, but trying his best to address ilya petrovitch also, though the latter persistently appeared to be rummaging among his papers and to be contemptuously oblivious of him.
0xbb930496f00bc0537fa180a060ee5eb7a81f840e “allow me to explain that i have been living with her for nearly three years and at first... at first... for why should i not confess it, at the very beginning i promised to marry her daughter, it was a verbal promise, freely given... she was a girl... indeed, i liked her, though i was not in love with her... a youthful affair in fact... that is, i mean to say, that my landlady gave me credit freely in those days, and i led a life of... i was very heedless...” “nobody asks you for these personal details, sir, we’ve no time to waste,” ilya petrovitch interposed roughly and with a note of triumph; but raskolnikov stopped him hotly, though he suddenly found it exceedingly difficult to speak.
0x317dec8cfbafcaf65641858c9e50a86c4330002c “but excuse me, excuse me.

0xf803bcf17c633437e3167d09d87137bed73f0b12 she said if only i gave her that, she would trust me again, as much as i liked, and that she would never, never--those were her own words--make use of that i o u till i could pay of myself... and now, when i have lost my lessons and have nothing to eat, she takes action against me.
0x04d6483fe5ac13a234c4e2326cbd4813260d279f what am i to say to that?”
0x9afa726b18e0e5f156cfecc1e9b15bce404741f0 “all these affecting details are no business of ours.”
0x6c6291001eac66a2725bd272ea45a4032c0206b2 ilya petrovitch interrupted rudely.
0x146005f87e0dc463fb2166803ca2a971e28d6a36 “you must give a written undertaking but as for your love affairs and all these tragic events, we have nothing to do with that.”

0x426b49ff4fd6ca19105674c69980b43ec086ddc6 said the head clerk to raskolnikov.
0xbd74fdd10fac4728d50427494f3bbf1db7ee56d2 “write what?”
0xd17277551cd1bc9a1922877ffe2bbd45020441c2 the latter asked, gruffly.
0x5b29ad7bc5dbca1017a4d3484f74a27670a497a6 “i will dictate to you.”
0x64d7e5265782f557f2418b892914acdca3dee4d1 raskolnikov fancied that the head clerk treated him more casually and contemptuously after his speech, but strange to say he suddenly felt completely indifferent to anyone’s opinion, and this revulsion took place in a flash, in one instant.
0x7e877415b64d16585a59461a4a0b5e169856b169 if he had cared to think a little, he would have been amazed indeed that he could have talked to them like that a minute before, forcing his feelings upon them.
0xf86f6e352f1cf772924ae4226a0ce39cb2b4a67c and where had those feelings come from?
0xa00e5fb6b9665150b4b898a763fa49b0cfa84b05 now if the whole room had been filled, not with police officers, but with those nearest and dearest to him, he would not have found one human word for them, so empty was his heart.
0x081c24e89985d2f0cf3a82bdff0aa542ae48e4e5 a gloomy sensation of agonising, everlasting solitude and remoteness, took conscious form in his soul.
0xffa1a85b199d0d010a44c21ceb912672c57d8563 it was not the meanness of his sentimental effusions before ilya petrovitch, nor the meanness of the latter’s triumph over him that had caused this sudden revulsion in his heart.
0x9b4c8cc2d115c9c586f847c658304a1c3c8d5cde oh, what had he to do now with his own baseness, with all these petty vanities, officers, german women, debts, police-offices?
0x8c55cdf06c21efc9f80037d5473003c539307e39 if he had been sentenced to be burnt at that moment, he would not have stirred, would hardly have heard the sentence to the end.
0x5eac310f1a7529e0905ff5e43c97d5f7bff0aca8 something was happening to him entirely new, sudden and unknown.
0x4e3ff0e5c8678f19a336ad8945e97e6ad5057bee it was not that he understood, but he felt clearly with all the intensity of sensation that he could never more appeal to these people in the police-office with sentimental effusions like his recent outburst, or with anything whatever; and that if they had been his own brothers and sisters and not police-officers, it would have been utterly out of the question to appeal to them in any circumstance of life.
0xf625020d31912e227139d9d191643a9b8f3456ec he had never experienced such a strange and awful sensation.
0x3f2f5dbe6bca9f32316b4da866bb3e8eb2b81e88 and what was most agonising--it was more a sensation than a conception or idea, a direct sensation, the most agonising of all the sensations he had known in his life.
0x0bf00663cd754c9d9cbc627db07851fe86db5374 the head clerk began dictating to him the usual form of declaration, that he could not pay, that he undertook to do so at a future date, that he would not leave the town, nor sell his property, and so on.
0x763fb8cc99140b714107242a8a7f543ce12274ca “but you can’t write, you can hardly hold the pen,” observed the head clerk, looking with curiosity at raskolnikov.
0x23965ba9ca6d65a03f86cabc07a803444fa705d0 “are you ill?”
0xf360d4172bb630166033c6581628843c3b663b48 “yes, i am giddy.
0x26b52fe2fde4a6bd240b538b1912b814b2119ff6 go on!”
0xaf0d650afdf2ab9d9fc816c84770131353fdfc52 “that’s all.
0x7d85a69b0dd0e7629cdd46acc873cedbd2816b65 sign it.”
0xb230a5db945fb6aab6976ba106449f09139c034a the head clerk took the paper, and turned to attend to others.
0x17743a612965824551aea6e63582b8a3cfb171a6 raskolnikov gave back the pen; but instead of getting up and going away, he put his elbows on the table and pressed his head in his hands.
0xf8c0e9b76770a5699b77bca8d1144e2896a09ff8 he felt as if a nail were being driven into his skull.
0xea720965210a690eb16f503798657e218fd73c1a a strange idea suddenly occurred to him, to get up at once, to go up to nikodim fomitch, and tell him everything that had happened yesterday, and then to go with him to his lodgings and to show him the things in the hole in the corner.
0xa2c437347c4b3f1ec7207ebc51cde039c2f5d829 the impulse was so strong that he got up from his seat to carry it out.
0x327a5618d635cb67a974d336ac6fd809183ac2bc “hadn’t i better think a minute?”
0xa5fe50718a585c571f9a77d0f5467871c2ea8365 flashed through his mind.
0x9b1e8e6ff742d8aab6bbf525ab694ce7a4077d63 “no, better cast off the burden without thinking.”
0x040b34592a45fb22f601fdfcbfd71fab7c004f74 but all at once he stood still, rooted to the spot.
0xa0748b760724e756889dcf6d8b984cf5f3d2220b nikodim fomitch was talking eagerly with ilya petrovitch, and the words reached him: “it’s impossible, they’ll both be released.
0x84cc7f73a9b74705be97b39703c1b193a36c9766 to begin with, the whole story contradicts itself.
0x57400d97459812fc05130e00fad9368fb1cafa7d why should they have called the porter, if it had been their doing?
0x4ccb075626af1202cc71aa1d14e76ec82ebb4821 to inform against themselves?
0x4b1d310a4215bca8a8675af14f46d74d37b7e962 or as a blind?
0xd76499d314945880bbe9cfc72855b21468cbb2a1 no, that would be too cunning!
0x74fd6934ec48501d0e32995b30df7f9f7881f958 besides, pestryakov, the student, was seen at the gate by both the porters and a woman as he went in.
0x2b2259632ce545b594139762a889c2c5af20a789 he was walking with three friends, who left him only at the gate, and he asked the porters to direct him, in the presence of the friends.
0xae9282f72af09fc3fe4580e0c038b2fff01b0136 now, would he have asked his way if he had been going with such an object?
0x8ad8ccf4d0c56a0912b1b0b7decd9dc1031f84b8 as for koch, he spent half an hour at the silversmith’s below, before he went up to the old woman and he left him at exactly a quarter to eight.
0x5fc03439217cf8f521a2319af647dd4c3496c51c now just consider...” “but excuse me, how do you explain this contradiction?
0x4391618c02695698a86089e80b48d893a3a83c17 they state themselves that they knocked and the door was locked; yet three minutes later when they went up with the porter, it turned out the door was unfastened.”
0x19a73361025f07c8742cca42cff9f8c7a2f030d2 “that’s just it; the murderer must have been there and bolted himself in; and they’d have caught him for a certainty if koch had not been an ass and gone to look for the porter too.
0x39a60e6ff1c2b36c4bdf40531769ba7c2da7dac1 _he_ must have seized the interval to get downstairs and slip by them somehow.
0x6a663a61103e76c005d7b710b38e5dfc4118e465 koch keeps crossing himself and saying: ‘if i had been there, he would have jumped out and killed me with his axe.’
0x7b82e71e671a21be3a5fbe74aeee9292e7a59daf he is going to have a thanksgiving service--ha, ha!”
0x4b2675acaa97543b06b8ab22ccd5a77ce8556d37 “and no one saw the murderer?”
0xb1e427e6cd99849cf88290dd33343b7a36b7e993 “they might well not see him; the house is a regular noah’s ark,” said the head clerk, who was listening.
0xbce4ccc0a9a21607879d5e12476c3fe17a730f23 “it’s clear, quite clear,” nikodim fomitch repeated warmly.
0x4a8cd18cb16e2acfb675760d1db13b2e31382de1 “no, it is anything but clear,” ilya petrovitch maintained.
0x05162ad5737b7c6af098a9568e0c35ff08623ea2 raskolnikov picked up his hat and walked towards the door, but he did not reach it.... when he recovered consciousness, he found himself sitting in a chair, supported by someone on the right side, while someone else was standing on the left, holding a yellowish glass filled with yellow water, and nikodim fomitch standing before him, looking intently at him.
0xc31e01d54ca64cd8f7027f93fe0cf2d7b198138d he got up from the chair.
0x58722ae76e5100416c0c33e3f8533fe186b989ff “what’s this?
0xec02044410db42c619c6a1b178d12c7be1e1daf2 are you ill?”
0xc397f571a097ad52ddf7e413fc02240c6b4f7973 nikodim fomitch asked, rather sharply.
0x27c666f5448156d60a67de470d1cd2dcf3cd423a “he could hardly hold his pen when he was signing,” said the head clerk, settling back in his place, and taking up his work again.
0x8d99d98d0ff5cac5f53d88ff46031ae2b94fd7a4 “have you been ill long?”
0x7b1210210cda5930a7a59a35ae02c3d00a462717 cried ilya petrovitch from his place, where he, too, was looking through papers.
0x216bbf67d00c8bf79ab685f6afd8a3487d1924e1 he had, of course, come to look at the sick man when he fainted, but retired at once when he recovered.
0x4b95fa080448d288c90b9329388d349a781029af “since yesterday,” muttered raskolnikov in reply.
0x569f279a629ae3bac7d8b9371aafbee7a210336c “did you go out yesterday?”
0xa00f66ccca0a0d5e24a747fa3544a07776ae36a4 “yes.”
0xa5120a4a1dc1a07cc73c018396e0e0fb4e5cd59e “though you were ill?”
0xa00f66ccca0a0d5e24a747fa3544a07776ae36a4 “yes.”
0x87d0a823703b3499808e7e3f1184a82a89a3e0b3 “at what time?”
0x31824d4509c19902b9a76da75a94be8ece5555b0 “about seven.”
0x8df8fea371c6d1094d23ebce2b918def687f1e42 “and where did you go, may i ask?”
0x465d27d65dcc3972de094b74befb2a8aba468834 “along the street.”
0xcf6c972264d79dcd28ce2ecc27c3905b7cbd7524 “short and clear.”
0x47ce1d1d8847d0b6d1e247e2e6ac58d59c070d84 raskolnikov, white as a handkerchief, had answered sharply, jerkily, without dropping his black feverish eyes before ilya petrovitch’s stare.
0x387c791e60aa5c309fdab690d1e74647baf824a7 “he can scarcely stand upright.
0x571f83ef87490ebf66208993e2a1ed7118b76e36 and you...” nikodim fomitch was beginning.
0x44b0131a9ab6a81810c0b7e600c6294f40f41352 “no matter,” ilya petrovitch pronounced rather peculiarly.
0xc4d2378f5066c86d328f0ddd7317b82729f2b941 nikodim fomitch would have made some further protest, but glancing at the head clerk who was looking very hard at him, he did not speak.
0xb98bb245c5f264e25b1848aa257e2ca9247a203d there was a sudden silence.
0x7fd380e903ce29d8cc71357488285a0946126f2c it was strange.
0xb567a982c51fcaf97d04bb3d5b28c142da797059 “very well, then,” concluded ilya petrovitch, “we will not detain you.”
0x98aafabf4388809402b0516e44c0a2027a7ffaee raskolnikov went out.
0xb091e16f5ec49374bbcd185eab102c162211a5e6 he caught the sound of eager conversation on his departure, and above the rest rose the questioning voice of nikodim fomitch.
0xd5a4742474482fba775a97f32ed5c4a361b9ee93 in the street, his faintness passed off completely.
0xad8646fec6b2685b889b71bb23876ba13a2f80ba “a search--there will be a search at once,” he repeated to himself, hurrying home.
0xfa79cb100633a958f3e8772a44cbcfcdc2607d8e “the brutes!
0xc60ac8d8dd1edf5d50a5f1059398e2bab5da477c they suspect.”
0x388644c7bc02c1fa0aa6f4597cf096a0746f5775 his former terror mastered him completely again.
0x6c0c8a1cebddd79fc0fab57d6bab3b117df8f367 chapter ii “and what if there has been a search already?
0x1bfecd732b5d662a1aae1ac1f62118430e9fa843 what if i find them in my room?”
0x86f2adee40ea1a3bb490abfa9d454d1847f9802d but here was his room.
0xf30b54a58a218e03bc055d9e372e7f5f635ddb84 nothing and no one in it.
0x086e02f9d39787a2bd565c82405e339715374b61 no one had peeped in.
0xb3a05cc10b0394234285cc80d647bdc915843373 even nastasya had not touched it.
0x6c557593282cd7efbcf48f2ca009a541e750e368 but heavens!
0x96842a2c0bd593d88fbe9d7bb1b9fa3549fb819c how could he have left all those things in the hole?
0xdbf92cd3bbe788be727e44b0fc83dfa66c8e213b he rushed to the corner, slipped his hand under the paper, pulled the things out and lined his pockets with them.
0x391fe26ea00bc91717f6ce9c6efdda604d7b9361 there were eight articles in all: two little boxes with ear-rings or something of the sort, he hardly looked to see; then four small leather cases.
0x7337d83bfbebbd33bf7c8a7f625b319b381d9fc3 there was a chain, too, merely wrapped in newspaper and something else in newspaper, that looked like a decoration.... he put them all in the different pockets of his overcoat, and the remaining pocket of his trousers, trying to conceal them as much as possible.
0xc2a933872dca0636ee4583accb082ab9a02670c6 he took the purse, too.
0x0e29045f80c01cf747b9583848e0d857a41373f4 then he went out of his room, leaving the door open.
0xea385788af2ddcbdffea3d4de4c6c7ed229fe79e he walked quickly and resolutely, and though he felt shattered, he had his senses about him.
0xa684f1cab650a2f1c7be5f132e59f28849da789a he was afraid of pursuit, he was afraid that in another half-hour, another quarter of an hour perhaps, instructions would be issued for his pursuit, and so at all costs, he must hide all traces before then.
0x7ceb06e410d852e68eb45aba1d55828e7ce3a073 he must clear everything up while he still had some strength, some reasoning power left him.... where was he to go?
0x228c295d8e9534fcdd995e7cf61112099e13ccb0 that had long been settled: “fling them into the canal, and all traces hidden in the water, the thing would be at an end.”
0x86c4322631146c9824b5288896742af0d36dceda so he had decided in the night of his delirium when several times he had had the impulse to get up and go away, to make haste, and get rid of it all.
0x7a2deb53ad0b986f682a78a05a9268df7a2e5b3b but to get rid of it, turned out to be a very difficult task.
0xd25a518d7e116cee75c3c2db0e6578c73cf3371d he wandered along the bank of the ekaterininsky canal for half an hour or more and looked several times at the steps running down to the water, but he could not think of carrying out his plan; either rafts stood at the steps’ edge, and women were washing clothes on them, or boats were moored there, and people were swarming everywhere.
0xd52f1efd5e6882c493546193ddd5658a0a6150c8 moreover he could be seen and noticed from the banks on all sides; it would look suspicious for a man to go down on purpose, stop, and throw something into the water.
0xd34a3247fd4f8e93ce16cb6d67d8c1cfeda3435e and what if the boxes were to float instead of sinking?
0x42ce0ee7b13d53da03f7ca6e9779efd907fe41c9 and of course they would.
0x6a82d1fd6102846ad0d082cd4a67b6862845a201 even as it was, everyone he met seemed to stare and look round, as if they had nothing to do but to watch him.
0x732e61407f0cda4de56a8c2d217d0f33387a147e “why is it, or can it be my fancy?”
0xf5eb9a7700c47f1c638e42f6143a3df6b0941693 he thought.
0xcb09ecd2f6332e835941f742f257bd4ba6940500 at last the thought struck him that it might be better to go to the neva.
0x456010cf9016562a01e865f1802e3f2a05c72656 there were not so many people there, he would be less observed, and it would be more convenient in every way, above all it was further off.
0x5a76acc3c78174bca148aef5d61c1e5d838d6f42 he wondered how he could have been wandering for a good half-hour, worried and anxious in this dangerous past without thinking of it before.
0x7e18691c3c65dd6694c676c10a392d7d139a19b9 and that half-hour he had lost over an irrational plan, simply because he had thought of it in delirium!
0xb0391c37ddbde03e485aedc04057652544759e03 he had become extremely absent and forgetful and he was aware of it.
0xad7d48452e96bdf15b48a693cb7896e1a7a647b1 he certainly must make haste.
0xf144205605b315b0353b5675dcf3cbff8af47fe6 he walked towards the neva along v---- prospect, but on the way another idea struck him.
0xfe10e0deaf0505f71b0ca2150a41aa2491d669cd “why to the neva?
0x66138a674dc74b7e80b9cced3ae596716c67fb05 would it not be better to go somewhere far off, to the islands again, and there hide the things in some solitary place, in a wood or under a bush, and mark the spot perhaps?”
0x299a81de29512e702b40b902d3658ddcd605c4dc and though he felt incapable of clear judgment, the idea seemed to him a sound one.
0x7aa751a0653dd16bfeb1dcca741657317e95049e but he was not destined to go there.
0x92ebc4f896d776318fcaff6a9ffaef73f1cbed5d for coming out of v---- prospect towards the square, he saw on the left a passage leading between two blank walls to a courtyard.
0xdb29d4843dc9ca58f35a4e00f83c5ab39f3ba8cf on the right hand, the blank unwhitewashed wall of a four-storied house stretched far into the court; on the left, a wooden hoarding ran parallel with it for twenty paces into the court, and then turned sharply to the left.
0x47aaa4927beab8ee0815f5bf25f42f3ed8b8cf6f here was a deserted fenced-off place where rubbish of different sorts was lying.
0xd1c186f4c16606dcc716775606bd3d090cded433 at the end of the court, the corner of a low, smutty, stone shed, apparently part of some workshop, peeped from behind the hoarding.
0xc8ee4841fe57af52cfa43de12b32da73f7b9643c it was probably a carriage builder’s or carpenter’s shed; the whole place from the entrance was black with coal dust.
0x2d03a71bc5fec7639b0227995ff03c905e1fab27 here would be the place to throw it, he thought.
0x7ffba20fe1f9bd4248cd978cde9445da35ff87a5 not seeing anyone in the yard, he slipped in, and at once saw near the gate a sink, such as is often put in yards where there are many workmen or cab-drivers; and on the hoarding above had been scribbled in chalk the time-honoured witticism, “standing here strictly forbidden.”
0x76dac4425dc038ddf06fe3134f964b98bf36bf79 this was all the better, for there would be nothing suspicious about his going in.
0xf6ce15e651fd1efc7d21dc2e6f9308c9e6662407 “here i could throw it all in a heap and get away!”
0x8064753ba64dfccbb542560871ea1b280adcf963 looking round once more, with his hand already in his pocket, he noticed against the outer wall, between the entrance and the sink, a big unhewn stone, weighing perhaps sixty pounds.
0xaa23f910d41db255289b1eaf61a87b7216d98197 the other side of the wall was a street.
0x607d6d13022e98a0ad71052ea7654564b8cb3944 he could hear passers-by, always numerous in that part, but he could not be seen from the entrance, unless someone came in from the street, which might well happen indeed, so there was need of haste.
0xb42ed09aff78e4d3bac42c6bdac48a98a29b9bef he bent down over the stone, seized the top of it firmly in both hands, and using all his strength turned it over.
0x797284466bf07f829819126184a818ddcc3e6839 under the stone was a small hollow in the ground, and he immediately emptied his pocket into it.
0x3019d80a28ac717173feca3bf81cb5110e3dfc74 the purse lay at the top, and yet the hollow was not filled up.
0x0806da97e3b56cbc1d49260b223c197610e1c4ae then he seized the stone again and with one twist turned it back, so that it was in the same position again, though it stood a very little higher.
0x9629c64fa547a3106a423fe4c452c1ca11e792ee but he scraped the earth about it and pressed it at the edges with his foot.
0x40320d43f51fac68706ef420541e04a013af7350 nothing could be noticed.
0x7a01168665428e4ec86e01ee209b0ad18655af4c then he went out, and turned into the square.
0x3fe85662ec8f100033f48b39c18338315b914885 again an intense, almost unbearable joy overwhelmed him for an instant, as it had in the police-office.
0xc48c44a5ab5fc543398b82f3ce8418ad11e04c9d “i have buried my tracks!
0xde43ed8d718c8260b198c2fa84d67736a0388757 and who, who can think of looking under that stone?
0x72caa6bd1046c0dbc23f93b2f57620475d24f982 it has been lying there most likely ever since the house was built, and will lie as many years more.
0xc96d359b8e5a38b69f0dd2d10ad2d443b498c1ef and if it were found, who would think of me?
0xd7ab2dc8162815ba22d79bd30b9cf971f3dcf856 it is all over!
0x294907f9f2255e424b22c517ee2f12b2aead5bcc no clue!”
0x44e9f3349cc734569a5afcef0eb071fe3ae9f3de and he laughed.
0xf4cc49d766ebc2d8078da8c648fe5640cd0191d1 yes, he remembered that he began laughing a thin, nervous noiseless laugh, and went on laughing all the time he was crossing the square.
0xc28aa1a2c9952de2bfd0704624f4c2b5fc478d2c but when he reached the k---- boulevard where two days before he had come upon that girl, his laughter suddenly ceased.
0x1f714bf0e238253534f5593a6cd0e73d53da2695 other ideas crept into his mind.
0xa0ac46de4c489ae92393dc8a9b22c2fe4f2af595 he felt all at once that it would be loathsome to pass that seat on which after the girl was gone, he had sat and pondered, and that it would be hateful, too, to meet that whiskered policeman to whom he had given the twenty copecks: “damn him!”
0x328bc16edb0a215fcd9f98fd426bcebc7936e975 he walked, looking about him angrily and distractedly.
0x095a777b62cc20825637b0f222eb913992928eb9 all his ideas now seemed to be circling round some single point, and he felt that there really was such a point, and that now, now, he was left facing that point--and for the first time, indeed, during the last two months.
0xca12a60d41cfc1e481ec23c97ad26201f3808b68 “damn it all!”
0x9459d3303d005f9169d64685334569646534e9b4 he thought suddenly, in a fit of ungovernable fury.
0x6be388147bab2536ab116882d8970a0a1eef3654 “if it has begun, then it has begun.
0x496acd7f782cb15332fa25bc7465281cc2deedd2 hang the new life!
0x0dcc4a1246bf5551bd02d42e9ac569353a2a57f4 good lord, how stupid it is!... and what lies i told to-day!
0x3fc7857f77863fb68e21a62959729969f9f596f0 how despicably i fawned upon that wretched ilya petrovitch!
0x1a15a544763d0f0be0e868dc6377fb21e5fcef5c but that is all folly!
0x03919c14aac3a4783607c754b3f4074c2578f207 what do i care for them all, and my fawning upon them!
0xb3b7d0c87ba388960843836ee436c56762480b7b it is not that at all!
0xcf8cd5eb0e95455035c9189e2e2d6f4f08e760e0 it is not that at all!”
0x0873bc3d1718305546526506574587e81bbbada0 suddenly he stopped; a new utterly unexpected and exceedingly simple question perplexed and bitterly confounded him.
0x4adbd2d9c94d810ecb947c5d6b5ffbfbf81a7a59 “if it all has really been done deliberately and not idiotically, if i really had a certain and definite object, how is it i did not even glance into the purse and don’t know what i had there, for which i have undergone these agonies, and have deliberately undertaken this base, filthy degrading business?
0x7598c7fab12066b4078d44036426b29a6cea9e7d and here i wanted at once to throw into the water the purse together with all the things which i had not seen either... how’s that?”
0x05151d456821e25a291c0ea705608d546391f292 yes, that was so, that was all so.
0x395b88fdbee05e030a9692ebf4383caed85b6e0f yet he had known it all before, and it was not a new question for him, even when it was decided in the night without hesitation and consideration, as though so it must be, as though it could not possibly be otherwise.... yes, he had known it all, and understood it all; it surely had all been settled even yesterday at the moment when he was bending over the box and pulling the jewel-cases out of it.... yes, so it was.
0xa708cb0e03af002b71d58f3a3e09c75fec8140a0 “it is because i am very ill,” he decided grimly at last, “i have been worrying and fretting myself, and i don’t know what i am doing.... yesterday and the day before yesterday and all this time i have been worrying myself.... i shall get well and i shall not worry.... but what if i don’t get well at all?
0xf4ffe20615a7bada7c518ba83e7c4b5e3d1f9ab7 good god, how sick i am of it all!”
0x2dcd3fe372ddab772cf3f441c3323005b9b2b7c1 he walked on without resting.
0x53795d58be7583662df62e24a52d6f538172a236 he had a terrible longing for some distraction, but he did not know what to do, what to attempt.
0x60bf9bd981070dee8f8664bf4dad6ae458c60ac0 a new overwhelming sensation was gaining more and more mastery over him every moment; this was an immeasurable, almost physical, repulsion for everything surrounding him, an obstinate, malignant feeling of hatred.
0xfcb649e0a7d580d0ff1bff1cc22ccaeb46c66623 all who met him were loathsome to him--he loathed their faces, their movements, their gestures.
0x89cc395525a5dba98244e98c8a177d897c3d8dd3 if anyone had addressed him, he felt that he might have spat at him or bitten him.... he stopped suddenly, on coming out on the bank of the little neva, near the bridge to vassilyevsky ostrov.
0x27c000e2a2a3347a8a21b14a8329165c3c144790 “why, he lives here, in that house,” he thought, “why, i have not come to razumihin of my own accord!
0x783a7610d3869970a7e2032ca2dd65c73b9d2356 here it’s the same thing over again.... very interesting to know, though; have i come on purpose or have i simply walked here by chance?
0xa918350f96aeb84aa21507868aa23fcb31e9e703 never mind, i said the day before yesterday that i would go and see him the day _after_; well, and so i will!
0xfcc8705add464787430bafda0320366f2c703c26 besides i really cannot go further now.”
0xe2efda64f99f7900702b9c240d974eb61178b0f1 he went up to razumihin’s room on the fifth floor.
0xcf12d29fcd27b5d328ed8e45aaa29537dbc24525 the latter was at home in his garret, busily writing at the moment, and he opened the door himself.
0x51263c1f5007975b8da3ff49b98e943dc53d51ab it was four months since they had seen each other.
0xc197a83b467a2d78ac5a55d9c6bbae3e4530cc9b razumihin was sitting in a ragged dressing-gown, with slippers on his bare feet, unkempt, unshaven and unwashed.
0xcc5df6cba445a1651bbe01a04ebafc8428633995 his face showed surprise.
0xccfcdf86ce27c644e2759deb325b8af5fed923c7 “is it you?”
0x6be4a61b9ed32ac9464aa8dfb8a9d0a99d485621 he cried.
0xb6aea96c83e9ccf8957697e44987d6174c80fe41 he looked his comrade up and down; then after a brief pause, he whistled.
0x883836b8521d35b102230ff850bfe7217131a9e0 “as hard up as all that!
0x613320d2db5ab9999ab8282192cc9cbd418f4578 why, brother, you’ve cut me out!”
0x4ebe9a4c7c7d01abba78fc41dfbbe9e77f6b940f he added, looking at raskolnikov’s rags.
0xa28a6f2dd2abbf2734bf7f6ad77da35e803635ae “come sit down, you are tired, i’ll be bound.”
0xba7b581009794d5a366183535f6d1dac6f10b721 and when he had sunk down on the american leather sofa, which was in even worse condition than his own, razumihin saw at once that his visitor was ill. “why, you are seriously ill, do you know that?”
0xd274c68dbe963b74fd385ec6303c88fa29736f8f he began feeling his pulse.
0x904a31a0755eb3d57f3a05d1cffc3ac27a21a80c raskolnikov pulled away his hand.
0x4c34ae0a7bcbf7977001168cd5b81a73998570f2 “never mind,” he said, “i have come for this: i have no lessons.... i wanted,... but i don’t really want lessons....” “but i say!
0x01d7b57bb1efaefcabd529b0b0082060b1cd4ddb you are delirious, you know!”
0x33921421dde9ff97097a5da67ff0bfb07691bfed razumihin observed, watching him carefully.
0x670a7292b12dcc6a4c7e6e49efd5dc03d78933b4 “no, i am not.”
0xdc4600e95dffaf242d29fb3835a2df2d36a6adbd raskolnikov got up from the sofa.
0xd3b4f5bfc290aa893d12466eae045c9a38ad9d78 as he had mounted the stairs to razumihin’s, he had not realised that he would be meeting his friend face to face.
0x757702a34be49ca6d74c9a29d445c43d48b6ac4e now, in a flash, he knew, that what he was least of all disposed for at that moment was to be face to face with anyone in the wide world.
0xb7f066a0de5dba8c35ad96238d556d4d4be1e050 his spleen rose within him.
0x66875d788c1d5d28392bd194853cecd1ad614f40 he almost choked with rage at himself as soon as he crossed razumihin’s threshold.
0xa15c1fc32a1e3c6a13204ea82cd4f6ba42788518 “good-bye,” he said abruptly, and walked to the door.
0x05b3a5c716a18181551de8aa61e547cdc4e0612a “stop, stop!
0xc7fd275deefea4c3c54f185b7e0a2de25a7f1d25 you queer fish.”
0x21ffba097a5555195929ed3768a5cec5a8e823ee “i don’t want to,” said the other, again pulling away his hand.
0x107d43d4d0ed4182b346801f0107dfe854df71c1 “then why the devil have you come?
0x2c3d02b9e718b13f646158bbff7ef81900f6c64c are you mad, or what?
0xaf814d33a1800c4c39662dc388db9d7c2d8996d1 why, this is... almost insulting!
0x36d9e57dc1eb2de0ed1c8a6c45023422638c74d8 i won’t let you go like that.”
0x07b29bd41ddaf087e32455f01cbf1fdf5ff78250 “well, then, i came to you because i know no one but you who could help... to begin... because you are kinder than anyone--cleverer, i mean, and can judge... and now i see that i want nothing.
0x892edd27fd5dd89b52d361e72c79e19124efa604 do you hear?
0x146585c52e4f52d450bbd74315015f83d3d224c3 nothing at all... no one’s services... no one’s sympathy.
0xdab57dd1147c20594b4bba965545ab498c5b19a0 i am by myself... alone.
0xf71991ac10b76025bc4aef160eef4e895ab1ffed come, that’s enough.
0xc85a5eaeffa2db54d72ea6a35c6e80ae76cf2f16 leave me alone.”
0x5f561f63628174ef0889671f9709a38542527498 “stay a minute, you sweep!
0x6382e44d4c93dfbc6e7cec653e2b1ccfb6b517ec you are a perfect madman.
0x4ea4723cbc437950be6fa3e738e33b6f717c9518 as you like for all i care.
0xf4ed43722a11efc7b694db9a8c723464dc14bf02 i have no lessons, do you see, and i don’t care about that, but there’s a bookseller, heruvimov--and he takes the place of a lesson.
0xf401ea1ad428a1b6400f66ea1a392e422763e481 i would not exchange him for five lessons.
0x3d24548225af980eecf656cfac12bc473abb2cce he’s doing publishing of a kind, and issuing natural science manuals and what a circulation they have!
0x6da95e6c87f834737d1eafb11f51ae867b51377a the very titles are worth the money!
0x38ff3a7185b47146538f02e6c4dbd7dde92c6087 you always maintained that i was a fool, but by jove, my boy, there are greater fools than i am!
0xd844cba2204d9e724d37eda94cd9b1591574de3b now he is setting up for being advanced, not that he has an inkling of anything, but, of course, i encourage him.
0xa3ecf26ffe46f7635f4bce6d2fac767febab00c0 here are two signatures of the german text--in my opinion, the crudest charlatanism; it discusses the question, ‘is woman a human being?’
0x4e9d295b2874ae8fb9631721d78d7f77f6623a58 and, of course, triumphantly proves that she is.
0xce24d1bda012fd0c673ffb80c4795e4bbcecc56a heruvimov is going to bring out this work as a contribution to the woman question; i am translating it; he will expand these two and a half signatures into six, we shall make up a gorgeous title half a page long and bring it out at half a rouble.
0x69e07268bf84d26b9054ee648ff2a2103c850efb it will do!
0x6545e7da24fb551d4f732f77e3c22aec91780d2b he pays me six roubles the signature, it works out to about fifteen roubles for the job, and i’ve had six already in advance.
0x4f84bb5b6c3813d06e2a7dcb50ed174fac8b68b7 when we have finished this, we are going to begin a translation about whales, and then some of the dullest scandals out of the second part of _les confessions_ we have marked for translation; somebody has told heruvimov, that rousseau was a kind of radishchev.
0x4469fa1fc2e4303cb9fb9acffe1e71a0c19b1b88 you may be sure i don’t contradict him, hang him!
0x58ddfec512a0b5fd9dc2f92bc858370197d8424a well, would you like to do the second signature of ‘_is woman a human being?_’ if you would, take the german and pens and paper--all those are provided, and take three roubles; for as i have had six roubles in advance on the whole thing, three roubles come to you for your share.
0x8ea37371cfb91a245ad5c806ca600649c691c44d and when you have finished the signature there will be another three roubles for you.
0xdd4f4e22be571220315bdf3f314692478850f5ca and please don’t think i am doing you a service; quite the contrary, as soon as you came in, i saw how you could help me; to begin with, i am weak in spelling, and secondly, i am sometimes utterly adrift in german, so that i make it up as i go along for the most part.
0x0d93248b031d6220fe8751bfe657e14b28742136 the only comfort is, that it’s bound to be a change for the better.
0x18efe5aedf38f375cde646feecccea39e1234cb9 though who can tell, maybe it’s sometimes for the worse.
0xb4588a76ee06952b161067db7f17d5c8e092b035 will you take it?”
0x89f79f6e70fdf5c1fe5ab9f884707e9249545fcd raskolnikov took the german sheets in silence, took the three roubles and without a word went out.
0x9fbb66b56d1f212ad2a878c8536d3efbe705e16e razumihin gazed after him in astonishment.
0x0a7eacfc0de80cc0a36752102c315baa9652a556 but when raskolnikov was in the next street, he turned back, mounted the stairs to razumihin’s again and laying on the table the german article and the three roubles, went out again, still without uttering a word.
0x25b873f0029ff51f32e36591732987e89b4d8e3d “are you raving, or what?”
0xf88c47f10e47a30123773aaf0fbfdcc8a10fd873 razumihin shouted, roused to fury at last.
0x436cc2f837f03c2291e72f1ed8f3e7a2461c78f3 “what farce is this?
0x57f4d49973a3e3f5a430f4a71dfe0bc900957eb7 you’ll drive me crazy too... what did you come to see me for, damn you?”
0x91ef70139dec39eb5f7fa063b12a92f97f725cf2 “i don’t want... translation,” muttered raskolnikov from the stairs.
0x53a868ed114d750cc2ee0eff0c59399e283f608a “then what the devil do you want?”
0x9e197694427537628b88e56e7916efebe6165f1d shouted razumihin from above.
0xd5cccb18edc637412a89018b44d8d67098386b15 raskolnikov continued descending the staircase in silence.
0x65d3cdb708654a335297b1cab1ef5d157ee99184 “hey, there!
0x039610b0ba592a2e2cb64193bde1a7747cb708bf where are you living?”
0x564ee9632194e7f7956ad204cc947e3a617fdecb no answer.
0xdde96a3fa557ee600170fec72e14863c94720855 “well, confound you then!”
0x7fcb095b9a710b1e1a18e431407da85f10891278 but raskolnikov was already stepping into the street.
0x8b9dac0969636a7319cfff79ad3eb8570d9e59a6 on the nikolaevsky bridge he was roused to full consciousness again by an unpleasant incident.
0x7e1631302148f6dbdaccef295126ba5e7a5abd80 a coachman, after shouting at him two or three times, gave him a violent lash on the back with his whip, for having almost fallen under his horses’ hoofs.
0x59c39c971e4d88f7f2446c26c1bcbbcc47fa43d6 the lash so infuriated him that he dashed away to the railing (for some unknown reason he had been walking in the very middle of the bridge in the traffic).
0xd4c95d722b658fb2eb6b61f0122bd12f326840b0 he angrily clenched and ground his teeth.
0x262b443824c6d266b571a42aad77e315a1258db1 he heard laughter, of course.
0x8abe1338021935aff337ebf74d8a23323edb9c20 “serves him right!”
0xe3d8439722cfe0ccf60f0c140bf42459ffe29391 “a pickpocket i dare say.”
0xdf332cd222f22b841c0d212d77c69711cc2ff0a9 “pretending to be drunk, for sure, and getting under the wheels on purpose; and you have to answer for him.”
0x5c714dc84010ed5128d3d86411f28c43778e27e0 “it’s a regular profession, that’s what it is.”
0xbaadb5e783881b7f47548f82f2a7775a6d97261c but while he stood at the railing, still looking angry and bewildered after the retreating carriage, and rubbing his back, he suddenly felt someone thrust money into his hand.
0x8890d4fc846350b038429f8924a2b8ac2c3b59f2 he looked.
0x9c8635025718f6841a76bd1567806d7846a328a0 it was an elderly woman in a kerchief and goatskin shoes, with a girl, probably her daughter, wearing a hat, and carrying a green parasol.

0x9248cb1029012423204331ac16d6d88798219f76 he took it and they passed on.
0x525a503756a1f47eb87b640b64cb4da568fe3065 it was a piece of twenty copecks.
0x21e2074855ea69e1587d55036812192deccdf66b from his dress and appearance they might well have taken him for a beggar asking alms in the streets, and the gift of the twenty copecks he doubtless owed to the blow, which made them feel sorry for him.
0x04ad9e8b592ac4da6539938ec396d57336a8762f he closed his hand on the twenty copecks, walked on for ten paces, and turned facing the neva, looking towards the palace.
0xf128e102cadacd4b8c71c1d668d02e030a118663 the sky was without a cloud and the water was almost bright blue, which is so rare in the neva.
0xd4c67681894cc61f4efccb6641e03ef31b8859db the cupola of the cathedral, which is seen at its best from the bridge about twenty paces from the chapel, glittered in the sunlight, and in the pure air every ornament on it could be clearly distinguished.
0x655e19df5a7f0858fda7815b4a8e6f52a7748776 the pain from the lash went off, and raskolnikov forgot about it; one uneasy and not quite definite idea occupied him now completely.
0x54c8bdc35e18ea8a1d13f7e920d234df6f110197 he stood still, and gazed long and intently into the distance; this spot was especially familiar to him.
0x680c02e81878274beebd2c6deb68d3b5766bceee when he was attending the university, he had hundreds of times--generally on his way home--stood still on this spot, gazed at this truly magnificent spectacle and almost always marvelled at a vague and mysterious emotion it roused in him.
0x89f1fa7b73ad8472230b173564ca57136b9bd741 it left him strangely cold; this gorgeous picture was for him blank and lifeless.
0xc0796abf95d519f27ee76a2fb3135c66a9a2971f he wondered every time at his sombre and enigmatic impression and, mistrusting himself, put off finding the explanation of it.
0xcc4d1caceea01218ca9f9ac08aad69071148210c he vividly recalled those old doubts and perplexities, and it seemed to him that it was no mere chance that he recalled them now.
0x566811fc690738c962ad9d422a43ee95a0cd8938 it struck him as strange and grotesque, that he should have stopped at the same spot as before, as though he actually imagined he could think the same thoughts, be interested in the same theories and pictures that had interested him... so short a time ago.
0xefd1d67288130bbccdb164053dd430c531d1970f he felt it almost amusing, and yet it wrung his heart.
0xf5e94af36fb4d982b7c25891dd58d80fc6cfded4 deep down, hidden far away out of sight all that seemed to him now--all his old past, his old thoughts, his old problems and theories, his old impressions and that picture and himself and all, all.... he felt as though he were flying upwards, and everything were vanishing from his sight.
0x2454a0abb8e90eb6d2e258439413a10cb27dffbc making an unconscious movement with his hand, he suddenly became aware of the piece of money in his fist.
0x0e59e2f4cee7a7d98f4453600499760f82f9df7f he opened his hand, stared at the coin, and with a sweep of his arm flung it into the water; then he turned and went home.
0x01109cd2c5b2b421d4b2adccc8d484c03be35499 it seemed to him, he had cut himself off from everyone and from everything at that moment.
0x6d3eb87d5795dec637399d057e53ce3bd19e3119 evening was coming on when he reached home, so that he must have been walking about six hours.
0x8c7da4860b3586c550bbf370b65d4466362f46d8 how and where he came back he did not remember.
0x313da8f4e70580260451d63017c12f94bb010b3d undressing, and quivering like an overdriven horse, he lay down on the sofa, drew his greatcoat over him, and at once sank into oblivion.... it was dusk when he was waked up by a fearful scream.
0xbaa4f67a2793ac620e1f620f156463095841dbf0 good god, what a scream!
0x88b4b29db0af43e9bcae6f133f4da1f505d78701 such unnatural sounds, such howling, wailing, grinding, tears, blows and curses he had never heard.
0xa6276dd059a55dc0785a3996ba73e4c5c217d4d4 he could never have imagined such brutality, such frenzy.
0x6fed7e17f1e6b3856d5677d1f90da5f89eb4f4fc in terror he sat up in bed, almost swooning with agony.
0xbdbbb45d9771a4e03ee3ba0269d64ea24c0f198d but the fighting, wailing and cursing grew louder and louder.
0x41dd335205eb87668832e554c6b463d09a597f65 and then to his intense amazement he caught the voice of his landlady.
0x042d8a839b76c212e5a5011a755dc4051e9e8f35 she was howling, shrieking and wailing, rapidly, hurriedly, incoherently, so that he could not make out what she was talking about; she was beseeching, no doubt, not to be beaten, for she was being mercilessly beaten on the stairs.
0xc5775404d54219fbfb505d7a580835abc3dd19e2 the voice of her assailant was so horrible from spite and rage that it was almost a croak; but he, too, was saying something, and just as quickly and indistinctly, hurrying and spluttering.
0xc72691d33f0c90bedd9318363eb63296778324f6 all at once raskolnikov trembled; he recognised the voice--it was the voice of ilya petrovitch.
0x9a5a2fa23b12b6666d30241a4377c512d9aca8e7 ilya petrovitch here and beating the landlady!
0xfbc24e095f70d9c50957696134bf8e95871157a0 he is kicking her, banging her head against the steps--that’s clear, that can be told from the sounds, from the cries and the thuds.
0x2a4086916e0c8a439605adbc66f26bb96225d0ae how is it, is the world topsy-turvy?
0xddcb21716c736fd705ecd140ed4bdd303e559a44 he could hear people running in crowds from all the storeys and all the staircases; he heard voices, exclamations, knocking, doors banging.
0x32790c80a6adbaae471fe3c8ce00d99e124c4269 “but why, why, and how could it be?”
0x372d4c12e99ba2edfc7adcdc8482162e4a097dd3 he repeated, thinking seriously that he had gone mad.
0xe7a4309dd22de05f38410fe0fa20d8d542b54d5a but no, he heard too distinctly!
0x027c6b275295204678048f6426822966bdb76bf3 and they would come to him then next, “for no doubt... it’s all about that... about yesterday.... good god!”
0xe6fe9f422cef9c07bb7c647d737ac7c610314b64 he would have fastened his door with the latch, but he could not lift his hand... besides, it would be useless.
0x24d445417e4bfef591eb86b73450d1db43107b2b terror gripped his heart like ice, tortured him and numbed him.... but at last all this uproar, after continuing about ten minutes, began gradually to subside.
0x6ab2e635c0e86d74d7c07462f1b80c682accccb3 the landlady was moaning and groaning; ilya petrovitch was still uttering threats and curses.... but at last he, too, seemed to be silent, and now he could not be heard.
0x4aaa093c624cf00cf06ff3edcb93ba3e8248967c “can he have gone away?
0xdd299e57bee825e0b098b9c2822f0b40a2f1917d good lord!”
0x4b5e24a357e5fb7d5a31b1da5f774da7c3b76d4a yes, and now the landlady is going too, still weeping and moaning... and then her door slammed.... now the crowd was going from the stairs to their rooms, exclaiming, disputing, calling to one another, raising their voices to a shout, dropping them to a whisper.
0xdc8bf20fa9947f6b2f0bcab2f98d1bd3433e917e there must have been numbers of them--almost all the inmates of the block.
0x92385bb8fab5eeeeebc87aa4fe32fdeb6477b5ea “but, good god, how could it be!
0x845d046cc6ef7ef30b24eadb08b284b14571b3a1 and why, why had he come here!”
0x1dfd7b8d54e43979b664c87d072486a709e680ed raskolnikov sank worn out on the sofa, but could not close his eyes.
0x4b6c6f17456920f15f11f61e3e8cb6757d05a43f he lay for half an hour in such anguish, such an intolerable sensation of infinite terror as he had never experienced before.
0x98d79db5c3a41b891f47317b8277812f66c45332 suddenly a bright light flashed into his room.
0x0090266a47fbda2333d723892c494d005fd8fce2 nastasya came in with a candle and a plate of soup.
0xd06328e71b1b5b346007ae57424fece29cdf1275 looking at him carefully and ascertaining that he was not asleep, she set the candle on the table and began to lay out what she had brought--bread, salt, a plate, a spoon.
0x48764535a5c5c07a2211f2eaf5b22afc389f2f1f “you’ve eaten nothing since yesterday, i warrant.
0x0165757a6cbe4e38f7cd8a434c9317143816ab83 you’ve been trudging about all day, and you’re shaking with fever.”
0xb38bf0b5b3885a63023248a45c6bcbc56e48c0f4 “nastasya... what were they beating the landlady for?”
0xd501cbdd547441a7924ef2cac8234e140351e354 she looked intently at him.
0xb4da8dac3b1016601c1f7706288d5e0ac679d068 “who beat the landlady?”
0x70a8e215b69cc4e4739a4493a2e4506256cfa033 “just now... half an hour ago, ilya petrovitch, the assistant superintendent, on the stairs.... why was he ill-treating her like that, and... why was he here?”
0xe52b86d5f21e61790ffa90c21f5b441a4bbd7a5b nastasya scrutinised him, silent and frowning, and her scrutiny lasted a long time.
0x9bb65076ec30f0db9362175d85b503f4ac4feea4 he felt uneasy, even frightened at her searching eyes.
0x2453369dfe4d47d5fefe4ad4154a74fda493477a “nastasya, why don’t you speak?”
0xae43bcdbe61fe58c1d70d1daab32feb4b1a963d8 he said timidly at last in a weak voice.
0xea08a1f7ed11aeca253d483131f5068d700c6034 “it’s the blood,” she answered at last softly, as though speaking to herself.
0x4a7713f14b3b931a772b1beea14e60d7963e0b94 “blood?
0xd604d36baef055f376580c279f8a563595aa1bb2 what blood?”
0xfe068b4dcb9c4f4aad3768fdab14b9d3904c7387 he muttered, growing white and turning towards the wall.
0x3806cb4a28857b8ff7aec2a158793fb92459b630 nastasya still looked at him without speaking.
0x53a56947ffb0e9ac02fceb572ab4e64cb0958759 “nobody has been beating the landlady,” she declared at last in a firm, resolute voice.
0xf975f07586914c39c2996e9cfb4fcad150142912 he gazed at her, hardly able to breathe.
0x458958f47d351820b50bc2612d231701f2d79dd7 “i heard it myself.... i was not asleep... i was sitting up,” he said still more timidly.
0xe6aa711e97965dcff2b87111f44caee0626a7d39 “i listened a long while.
0x2d9003e7d3dbd85591e6f2861012e7fc72d28599 the assistant superintendent came.... everyone ran out on to the stairs from all the flats.”
0x58c13670c2d67ec06ed9bc707250abd516ef7263 “no one has been here.
0xafd1265da6321e5d949c0eb80ce166185653ed43 that’s the blood crying in your ears.
0x86648c08c1c1ae517cde63904e430dbd8499e086 when there’s no outlet for it and it gets clotted, you begin fancying things.... will you eat something?”
0xa2bece4918e7a29d3362438377dac3343a13fdb2 he made no answer.
0xce749bd567a94bc663f5e6cbbffd69ea4e125e2b nastasya still stood over him, watching him.
0x62ec93fdfb0fe3e06ec9a4d95cdc5d09a5aa125f “give me something to drink... nastasya.”
0xc5807cf2cb3b0bb06545c9ba2b1fe66ca2e92385 she went downstairs and returned with a white earthenware jug of water.
0x61a939a71f6837cb23f94ec118550cbf55ac0d71 he remembered only swallowing one sip of the cold water and spilling some on his neck.
0xe67d6c7820c76ee77cdcb24f8abb102e22c889bd then followed forgetfulness.
0xd46568b67e76514202a85584d6b657602f390971 chapter iii he was not completely unconscious, however, all the time he was ill; he was in a feverish state, sometimes delirious, sometimes half conscious.
0x86f6df49bb3919dcc25e54790fb8cbd9466ce413 he remembered a great deal afterwards.
0x62934f9b706579ca21839dd01988f2274a7a30c2 sometimes it seemed as though there were a number of people round him; they wanted to take him away somewhere, there was a great deal of squabbling and discussing about him.
0x33d077b6a582d9a1e3fab202c54107eefb959bd4 then he would be alone in the room; they had all gone away afraid of him, and only now and then opened the door a crack to look at him; they threatened him, plotted something together, laughed, and mocked at him.
0x4f2dc7de8cbecfb5294550d3536a913558fa05af he remembered nastasya often at his bedside; he distinguished another person, too, whom he seemed to know very well, though he could not remember who he was, and this fretted him, even made him cry.
0xb0202f73d59e68692c9b18dd61c0c51b48656059 sometimes he fancied he had been lying there a month; at other times it all seemed part of the same day.
0x5096daa76156d2710fc63f989a5aee08741d7a1d but of _that_--of _that_ he had no recollection, and yet every minute he felt that he had forgotten something he ought to remember.
0x5a890f7b0e8d63c5ee257fa2df2607976aef0ffb he worried and tormented himself trying to remember, moaned, flew into a rage, or sank into awful, intolerable terror.
0xbf2d7a66243b48f3cd36c291d1a41f0c81b0eb04 then he struggled to get up, would have run away, but someone always prevented him by force, and he sank back into impotence and forgetfulness.
0x585e7a2606bfb97a249f1325fc71c889cbb1056a at last he returned to complete consciousness.
0x7af183aaca54e19cb9fdb465ca2a02c300dcbbcd it happened at ten o’clock in the morning.
0x9c42a8b8858a805f799f7e12cb3fb166991da46c on fine days the sun shone into the room at that hour, throwing a streak of light on the right wall and the corner near the door.
0x7ed90269355872bbe00028515b69ef67eff56a26 nastasya was standing beside him with another person, a complete stranger, who was looking at him very inquisitively.
0xd950386ed4f71ec941aa5c5cc03ec489566679b7 he was a young man with a beard, wearing a full, short-waisted coat, and looked like a messenger.
0xa18420e79a9e0375134bbc8dd45321b9bd2c802f the landlady was peeping in at the half-opened door.
0xe70aa2bf6062c6e297017ad586c72ab9c38ed350 raskolnikov sat up.
0x01303a03c1a5f28e18e0802576c8f43ea28666a0 “who is this, nastasya?”
0x6a04442f02c5da6760aba5c1a61b4916ffa4ecd7 he asked, pointing to the young man.
0xd4821796091e8d74143b5ab8e7b890e89c0a4613 “i say, he’s himself again!”
0x872d64908de9411a7cda4720f080878bbc75efda she said.
0x5b7f5228f35889a720a614318ed783d914ec09a8 “he is himself,” echoed the man.
0xebc967204492266c39cd51d44d24d107fb829aec concluding that he had returned to his senses, the landlady closed the door and disappeared.
0x25f9634377e30a57c0c848178de727e42a5539ef she was always shy and dreaded conversations or discussions.
0x6e4b4398b5c34ce7b9ccc5ac7431b992ae766cf0 she was a woman of forty, not at all bad-looking, fat and buxom, with black eyes and eyebrows, good-natured from fatness and laziness, and absurdly bashful.
0xc8c5b2550c2c11b89a3a1dd0f085e2149ff5ac90 “who... are you?”
0x1d69b158e406dee01c70954b75ec7ea81aec1a2e he went on, addressing the man.
0x1c4debc669b574b1e3b913da7cc9e6cabd32c1a5 but at that moment the door was flung open, and, stooping a little, as he was so tall, razumihin came in.
0x19fc1a4160b39afe89ced6a872562300c12a3c8e “what a cabin it is!”
0x6be4a61b9ed32ac9464aa8dfb8a9d0a99d485621 he cried.

0x161733cf7f8b9b1f39d6aed7b49c8d6f732442e3 “just come to,” echoed the man again, with a smile.
0x8a50dee4571256b2f43889217b23d872f95683bd “and who are you?”
0x438f6a9d46ea980817896db23569905fba1fe90b razumihin asked, suddenly addressing him.
0x95c8b7dcd2176699388c22a8cce31d9ca92d92e0 “my name is vrazumihin, at your service; not razumihin, as i am always called, but vrazumihin, a student and gentleman; and he is my friend.

0x49faf6905dfebc4756fd98af2d5fb7da12faafba “if you are in an intelligible condition, i’ve thirty-five roubles to remit to you, as semyon semyonovitch has received from afanasy ivanovitch at your mamma’s request instructions to that effect, as on previous occasions.
0x477d9e3350013bd2aa2c9cc23847880be8be07b8 do you know him, sir?”
0x34a80d5bd709f6b5a58a9c140069bac4823065e4 “yes, i remember... vahrushin,” raskolnikov said dreamily.
0x23b48a6a876944aa43808fdd3615006b44e0a34b “you hear, he knows vahrushin,” cried razumihin.
0x5ab264a7693308b6cc2e5c52dbfb967fe410adbe “he is in ‘an intelligible condition’!

0x7b00a720f25939262a9b93ee72cac72923854e6d well, it’s always pleasant to hear words of wisdom.”
0x4943932e711d37e275d24f384d304bf9f89627f3 “that’s the gentleman, vahrushin, afanasy ivanovitch.
0x2871feb9bce7bc392e042f5f81eef15176d00034 and at the request of your mamma, who has sent you a remittance once before in the same manner through him, he did not refuse this time also, and sent instructions to semyon semyonovitch some days since to hand you thirty-five roubles in the hope of better to come.”
0x4c1c86d5fccfc8083b7ea1ea8a3931ce71363cdb “that ‘hoping for better to come’ is the best thing you’ve said, though ‘your mamma’ is not bad either.

0x511503d35ce888930a2c73c82c2ff35f1c7785b5 is he fully conscious, eh?”

0xd8ef9b9ee375320eb222bb4f18d301deffbdf0ea “i don’t want it,” said raskolnikov, pushing away the pen.
0x7a689a2b0e5acf20744465fdd34d278574fb9bda “not want it?”
0x941913f46cf8680ebbe05f9b1a8fdf8d7507fc12 “i won’t sign it.”

0xa3eddf814f6a05a9912971f2843de7c0dd60df00 you are a man of judgment.... now, rodya, don’t keep your visitor, you see he is waiting,” and he made ready to hold raskolnikov’s hand in earnest.
0x02968a864081ad7ae545cfe7b5988187e33ddd21 “stop, i’ll do it alone,” said the latter, taking the pen and signing his name.
0x113fc8b3f554c07e1b1f2fc732a341f677d360e6 the messenger took out the money and went away.
0x0c284c3e236b9771eb61d5a15904080b97fac07f “bravo!
0x424404dbcf6e907129fe3ed6cc387896fe85711e and now, brother, are you hungry?”
0x660e92aab5b7533939dfe4c1eba44c4b818f5efd “yes,” answered raskolnikov.
0xff6933d0b29942a91d9c741e9546c50b09b9a1cc “is there any soup?”
0x7730200a7800371d5896628d584f41ff203abc68 “some of yesterday’s,” answered nastasya, who was still standing there.
0xd7c6bff65b289fcb01a5c02046e6e7095bde25cb “with potatoes and rice in it?”
0xa00f66ccca0a0d5e24a747fa3544a07776ae36a4 “yes.”
0xa58d9ed3778fc85c3274b833a5ab5990a2616023 “i know it by heart.
0xee776864f4f042cd9832b8523724ac615b259199 bring soup and give us some tea.”
0xada5dba1697f2858d336c30f7bcf2f79806cbfc9 “very well.”
0xe528512352ce64e032f42c3a8ec865ecedb23a4b raskolnikov looked at all this with profound astonishment and a dull, unreasoning terror.
0xa16122179efbcbebdb63118152016b838582dd0a he made up his mind to keep quiet and see what would happen.
0xb0c96bf62a411f218bad60808e79e829a846bcff “i believe i am not wandering.
0xb8f8ae0b3b5da7b55c995c6ca2cca0d5e02cdb55 i believe it’s reality,” he thought.
0x7c8f41d71678424410ffd999286349d924e460b5 in a couple of minutes nastasya returned with the soup, and announced that the tea would be ready directly.
0xd1b0b52fb395aaedf3531f332217de6cffd8b713 with the soup she brought two spoons, two plates, salt, pepper, mustard for the beef, and so on.
0xe932be6be0aeaf080bb7dbb5a33c6974781ec854 the table was set as it had not been for a long time.
0x4e4738242c7a7fbafd80cfc8d8d77eec330f7f45 the cloth was clean.
0x67a4bbe88a0002d39191af39e9cf13e5d9ee01cd “it would not be amiss, nastasya, if praskovya pavlovna were to send us up a couple of bottles of beer.
0x40a286972a0044fbc73bff4149b140131be3ad24 we could empty them.”
0xf08e3d83f4cd132841b4abed34b7e7e40b23e298 “well, you are a cool hand,” muttered nastasya, and she departed to carry out his orders.
0xf494b5abae138efb129a1f9e1ab4207b3872ee18 raskolnikov still gazed wildly with strained attention.
0xdb4fd4d66d4dd75a45fc75bb65071297bac58e78 meanwhile razumihin sat down on the sofa beside him, as clumsily as a bear put his left arm round raskolnikov’s head, although he was able to sit up, and with his right hand gave him a spoonful of soup, blowing on it that it might not burn him.
0x7b1b4f95473cd2b7c3613f797f34933dd3bdb015 but the soup was only just warm.
0xc3ca1b3dbc8e7ba86b0442384dc1f44f74ffe95c raskolnikov swallowed one spoonful greedily, then a second, then a third.
0xc599259f294bb75d8331e49a2214c98513cfa25f but after giving him a few more spoonfuls of soup, razumihin suddenly stopped, and said that he must ask zossimov whether he ought to have more.
0x51dc12d58a34ca5dfa27323b86706bdd1eb60654 nastasya came in with two bottles of beer.
0x028f9fbf66db47eb36c80367517fe14bd4454406 “and will you have tea?”
0xa00f66ccca0a0d5e24a747fa3544a07776ae36a4 “yes.”
0x312374abe51c8ce5b85ef3d2a63c06f4a15ad5a4 “cut along, nastasya, and bring some tea, for tea we may venture on without the faculty.
0x3c0ee011f00e4ab20c60ed303e1cef8ba5a262c8 but here is the beer!”
0xd062a32e14f19d185196701d498390ac726d4304 he moved back to his chair, pulled the soup and meat in front of him, and began eating as though he had not touched food for three days.
0xbf928f08dee74bd7c5e4e0897e20ffa8b6552eb7 “i must tell you, rodya, i dine like this here every day now,” he mumbled with his mouth full of beef, “and it’s all pashenka, your dear little landlady, who sees to that; she loves to do anything for me.
0x6b49782c3e8ef4b3c35ec8528873d79ea42998f6 i don’t ask for it, but, of course, i don’t object.
0x961d5907c1738342690db2f8eacc77aa228e41d1 and here’s nastasya with the tea.
0x15686df8607e4c224e0d55d696181ecd96373e36 she is a quick girl.
0xaea5e734117799222fd5593bdf00688c5a57639c nastasya, my dear, won’t you have some beer?”
0x1aa98fcbc60e7a827017fdf492bf09e5eb33ce70 “get along with your nonsense!”
0x96a486a3b17832ea14f5babaa1a390d604ceccfb “a cup of tea, then?”
0xaa9b43bab3b3eb0497cd0353da7a06e6a54eaa14 “a cup of tea, maybe.”
0xcb45476114208f9cdcc19d628dc44f4f73f0ddc0 “pour it out.
0x3eb6b53834b732394d5d587d7364f9524a534ee1 stay, i’ll pour it out myself.
0xa2cb854c83f7a2e980b44ae92f189ffd2d195f00 sit down.”
0x2508b001d6d82672bedc9e7a9f26672727a4f64e he poured out two cups, left his dinner, and sat on the sofa again.
0x27616c706556d3a8ac0069cf40cafca8d4c1d624 as before, he put his left arm round the sick man’s head, raised him up and gave him tea in spoonfuls, again blowing each spoonful steadily and earnestly, as though this process was the principal and most effective means towards his friend’s recovery.
0x3c8eee6603b4a6240e76d01bbf2e970452e12a24 raskolnikov said nothing and made no resistance, though he felt quite strong enough to sit up on the sofa without support and could not merely have held a cup or a spoon, but even perhaps could have walked about.
0x9732d1403315148ffa5e99a42ce7cdd0c780e96f but from some queer, almost animal, cunning he conceived the idea of hiding his strength and lying low for a time, pretending if necessary not to be yet in full possession of his faculties, and meanwhile listening to find out what was going on.
0x6f1102c033b4f618774904d37af4a66249d06bb3 yet he could not overcome his sense of repugnance.
0xa2367b33dbc8cbf8a46de71f2f78a5e1c61bc964 after sipping a dozen spoonfuls of tea, he suddenly released his head, pushed the spoon away capriciously, and sank back on the pillow.
0xd886bd55d3755e5692d62d44c06cf75390f142e3 there were actually real pillows under his head now, down pillows in clean cases, he observed that, too, and took note of it.
0xce82e14a243c5145646133a218cd0f792a89c8c8 “pashenka must give us some raspberry jam to-day to make him some raspberry tea,” said razumihin, going back to his chair and attacking his soup and beer again.
0x22daceb04275be5603738509b744e8512485107e “and where is she to get raspberries for you?”
0x22ae718ea8b923c53c9cccb959e6119c3670f890 asked nastasya, balancing a saucer on her five outspread fingers and sipping tea through a lump of sugar.
0x74d82b363f0802b93f11808d5dae4a461c94b99c “she’ll get it at the shop, my dear.
0x151ad84164f14b165886a39829dfb403b79d3983 you see, rodya, all sorts of things have been happening while you have been laid up.
0x9dc86c228473a857ced0de5b20255a39bf224f43 when you decamped in that rascally way without leaving your address, i felt so angry that i resolved to find you out and punish you.
0xd9133595869e02e16376eb6b9dec77278a713fab i set to work that very day.
0x78f22f6e1b0b0dda3ce52c46e67720fc55a03c4e how i ran about making inquiries for you!
0xf6b2a4e379ddcfa4b58505888db9ba967de75855 this lodging of yours i had forgotten, though i never remembered it, indeed, because i did not know it; and as for your old lodgings, i could only remember it was at the five corners, harlamov’s house.
0x9cf6201198667d8897e150bc69a2ea7787c8dea6 i kept trying to find that harlamov’s house, and afterwards it turned out that it was not harlamov’s, but buch’s.
0x13a83144a081e7e2653f80ba8f79c1fe656ea358 how one muddles up sound sometimes!
0xd8607ab5e03bc02f90af1e0cfa0fc97a26b211b0 so i lost my temper, and i went on the chance to the address bureau next day, and only fancy, in two minutes they looked you up!
0x3eaacebaf356e421911f577e4f278f63e2328a8f your name is down there.”
0xd24ccf62acc8953cb380d21cd6e4e691292fcda9 “my name!”
0x3c262bc18f60b0add3b0adc2ec8403d6349ab753 “i should think so; and yet a general kobelev they could not find while i was there.
0x57418763948d1cce4b5921b38193e9949f677b25 well, it’s a long story.
0xb8b4a056f23e544895a02dde30c6fca3f8aa0f69 but as soon as i did land on this place, i soon got to know all your affairs--all, all, brother, i know everything; nastasya here will tell you.
0x4e51532962beee73e14bd322c4355b22dbf7ac54 i made the acquaintance of nikodim fomitch and ilya petrovitch, and the house-porter and mr. zametov, alexandr grigorievitch, the head clerk in the police office, and, last, but not least, of pashenka; nastasya here knows....” “he’s got round her,” nastasya murmured, smiling slyly.
0x58236a9f052b484c288057a3cfd21cacc5decae5 “why don’t you put the sugar in your tea, nastasya nikiforovna?”
0xb132dae61e8dca3a32ffb863e2e8ac120bc13c61 “you are a one!”
0x04024a65b251f6c84001cdc2b606c99f23adab62 nastasya cried suddenly, going off into a giggle.
0x5a753b7e1b5a9f625c0e260ca9e3ea3f718e8fdd “i am not nikiforovna, but petrovna,” she added suddenly, recovering from her mirth.
0xb11108d8452be629ae863a012d5be19af9cccd8d “i’ll make a note of it.
0xf9e6b1107e430320c6d77c256393e06916a43aff well, brother, to make a long story short, i was going in for a regular explosion here to uproot all malignant influences in the locality, but pashenka won the day.
0xae7cdd8622df456eb4ee9991a2844247b36d9788 i had not expected, brother, to find her so... prepossessing.
0x85d4eec16153621c4a0d6527aa10d065140b67e6 eh, what do you think?”
0xe4daeff2a945c42ba50cdeecb8a01ae5b6b170f4 raskolnikov did not speak, but he still kept his eyes fixed upon him, full of alarm.
0x690521ec6c9931a15c799fb90c58218382c00607 “and all that could be wished, indeed, in every respect,” razumihin went on, not at all embarrassed by his silence.
0xd35ea64837ff72c08f03a60566b333dd839c68aa “ah, the sly dog!”
0x820b7df0ab203cdbe78952e2e9e7eff468cc9243 nastasya shrieked again.
0xf74b85c01d28b3bfb78b588d23b25695cdf93dfe this conversation afforded her unspeakable delight.
0xddf151bcd0a107ea654d2177863b4a6ce6538e5c “it’s a pity, brother, that you did not set to work in the right way at first.
0x8773bf27d3fe770f0fb44610cd53716ad722a873 you ought to have approached her differently.
0xe68792100f7dabe677a741bc66e10e90fc0067bc she is, so to speak, a most unaccountable character.
0xb6ce7de35b4617af6b1ed55c6ca119af742f62ef but we will talk about her character later.... how could you let things come to such a pass that she gave up sending you your dinner?
0x172ccc0c46dbf09bfc6426ed9ac0d7cc948ce638 and that i o u?
0x7b1d5d2e7495ceeca19423b5bd50e169bde4f2e2 you must have been mad to sign an i o u. and that promise of marriage when her daughter, natalya yegorovna, was alive?... i know all about it!
0xae5347ac16c032c709201172b230298770a0c96d but i see that’s a delicate matter and i am an ass; forgive me.
0x6c5f8795669741902e8e7399be159cd186d66616 but, talking of foolishness, do you know praskovya pavlovna is not nearly so foolish as you would think at first sight?”
0xc100fb231c00dc461e04d4769f4b624b5384b6c3 “no,” mumbled raskolnikov, looking away, but feeling that it was better to keep up the conversation.
0x02cf50220b383fd07ef5d599c6731f329a0260b6 “she isn’t, is she?”
0xafdf4f3c052a46ce635dbec7f0f102b24fea10dd cried razumihin, delighted to get an answer out of him.
0x2e66abfcf2549b4007b0519a4e6b5403a3f3eecc “but she is not very clever either, eh?
0x9c4e4823d798dda79077b3475a568fe93331ec28 she is essentially, essentially an unaccountable character!
0xd95f101282803d4f333407e702df211a9604c874 i am sometimes quite at a loss, i assure you.... she must be forty; she says she is thirty-six, and of course she has every right to say so.
0xa098523250bfbb23f916da201e8d64fd7baab3f7 but i swear i judge her intellectually, simply from the metaphysical point of view; there is a sort of symbolism sprung up between us, a sort of algebra or what not!
0xec9d5185c796984abe6d26128ede4d2c7e01883b i don’t understand it!
0x24180705851a972c0f79278d40b34f97522e54a6 well, that’s all nonsense.
0x03e310e4dff04755835a9cc065801ce7c57fd666 only, seeing that you are not a student now and have lost your lessons and your clothes, and that through the young lady’s death she has no need to treat you as a relation, she suddenly took fright; and as you hid in your den and dropped all your old relations with her, she planned to get rid of you.
0x54debe0b5fa79b6cc0d53402d6bb69599bdf0a80 and she’s been cherishing that design a long time, but was sorry to lose the i o u, for you assured her yourself that your mother would pay.”
0x0ae6595c301470f6313294ddd9e524d113cabf9d “it was base of me to say that.... my mother herself is almost a beggar... and i told a lie to keep my lodging... and be fed,” raskolnikov said loudly and distinctly.
0x0fa75d17b356f38c69a13db8e0909a270b5e7cf5 “yes, you did very sensibly.
0x96a10f6ca2b281c69b1dabc656a0caf434eb9724 but the worst of it is that at that point mr. tchebarov turns up, a business man.
0x9823888de8c4263cfe8fae22f2fce8dde3c3dddb pashenka would never have thought of doing anything on her own account, she is too retiring; but the business man is by no means retiring, and first thing he puts the question, ‘is there any hope of realising the i o u?’
0x8ab9bf42438847d4840c2fd258a486e27cdf4ce6 answer: there is, because he has a mother who would save her rodya with her hundred and twenty-five roubles pension, if she has to starve herself; and a sister, too, who would go into bondage for his sake.
0xfce6873f31f7601914d1569b1802924d120aaf56 that’s what he was building upon.... why do you start?
0x9663cbba54277a0f37f499e23159153a62242311 i know all the ins and outs of your affairs now, my dear boy--it’s not for nothing that you were so open with pashenka when you were her prospective son-in-law, and i say all this as a friend.... but i tell you what it is; an honest and sensitive man is open; and a business man ‘listens and goes on eating’ you up.
0xd3b9a02e20c12060f1bee2ba2129be2c73b93235 well, then she gave the i o u by way of payment to this tchebarov, and without hesitation he made a formal demand for payment.
0x3540e1173e09b7959dfc9d7ab2008bfff9309d9b when i heard of all this i wanted to blow him up, too, to clear my conscience, but by that time harmony reigned between me and pashenka, and i insisted on stopping the whole affair, engaging that you would pay.
0x1b8936a5a8ba0cddf24c0d472579ee86f1243be4 i went security for you, brother.
0x358ecff058614831827cca0c207c360691d81ab6 do you understand?
0xf6320a322302814c7633ea59044e4151be20d1b2 we called tchebarov, flung him ten roubles and got the i o u back from him, and here i have the honour of presenting it to you.
0x90ee43e748b222aa4edd9e378d3d4995a8c2db8f she trusts your word now.
0xc5b99dfa1ac33ed7c7e297a8f744a2d0196f0e55 here, take it, you see i have torn it.”
0xa2ca2decc73c23bb6275653a112a931cbff37384 razumihin put the note on the table.
0xa8da488a55de8db692c9c0466d67c8b664deaa3f raskolnikov looked at him and turned to the wall without uttering a word.
0xa623d6ecd2d603d2f205962de2937f910f7cd029 even razumihin felt a twinge.
0x85ce759ae62cd6a7f1da68c144f6996c4f17471c “i see, brother,” he said a moment later, “that i have been playing the fool again.
0xc06954acfcb017c1e2fff4e8e554ed210756ccaf i thought i should amuse you with my chatter, and i believe i have only made you cross.”
0x0c0e3fe513c4d36570f635d4bcf28f217414fb53 “was it you i did not recognise when i was delirious?”
0x1d586db96c7520cb305e4b3c1e2064add8f1f111 raskolnikov asked, after a moment’s pause without turning his head.
0x96090a6adf8ad52fed5d4075fb8de2e1ab6287e2 “yes, and you flew into a rage about it, especially when i brought zametov one day.”
0x4580c8d032da8df6b2a0f56fed6ba1878272b0fe “zametov?
0x8915491f5f9224ab98cf71f030e45ece5ef6accf the head clerk?
0x551dbe9d7356f7fd8c85d9654f4bdb49f8a4b340 what for?”
0xd8a96381b6c3f8645805e35d0d21011d0fc64883 raskolnikov turned round quickly and fixed his eyes on razumihin.
0x697593fe7eb277dbca47d2c1858a7b2455d1cfdd “what’s the matter with you?... what are you upset about?
0xc5d168f87c9dacc2ed0e5ab420ca9d2c54adf5d5 he wanted to make your acquaintance because i talked to him a lot about you.... how could i have found out so much except from him?
0x5aff523ec881ee4f75bae7e7ad9756cd65cae47c he is a capital fellow, brother, first-rate... in his own way, of course.
0xb31b69fe3f4fff1c43508a03be1fb48a4619e364 now we are friends--see each other almost every day.
0x774304e93c7b55a6d76006816b1b823bf36fee43 i have moved into this part, you know.
0x1c395f6a4b4f4d68beb595c900f59820bd74d1a8 i have only just moved.
0xe4bcad060d44355eeec85cc4ac19ad4ff71bb063 i’ve been with him to luise ivanovna once or twice.... do you remember luise, luise ivanovna?
0x533d13c08032e5bcd61350ee168cb002e486a8a8 “did i say anything in delirium?”
0x6f9d465f50bb6ab6f0d8e3053e17a4631c73b317 “i should think so!
0xd1f7d25435dea9b606301b28b75bda61347dcf94 you were beside yourself.”
0x3cda528a11c2b8fdfa5d37a28c76dab964992f57 “what did i rave about?”
0xcdd2ef9dd62b087803ce7572809e68f30cf98d8c “what next?
0x3b635ff57b5eca38ed4824f842cbecc05e5a86e3 what did you rave about?
0x3b54b464e1a0c70736756c128fa5f0122ba797ab what people do rave about.... well, brother, now i must not lose time.
0x7348f3aedaf338bf639b13030a0682689c6d665f to work.”
0x3f1734893c01daa06c3d78df6b44ed1ce352a766 he got up from the table and took up his cap.
0x3cda528a11c2b8fdfa5d37a28c76dab964992f57 “what did i rave about?”
0x33225d8fdd83aa708952a1c85dd4051da54a4c3e “how he keeps on!
0xb7dee6d6a0044cc356d175a2aeec44378685c575 are you afraid of having let out some secret?
0x8516c91bacf894b4323972d9a7f59ed19992728e don’t worry yourself; you said nothing about a countess.
0x07881e02f79637abe701cc83150880f5fecf303a but you said a lot about a bulldog, and about ear-rings and chains, and about krestovsky island, and some porter, and nikodim fomitch and ilya petrovitch, the assistant superintendent.
0x3453cd4a24972d260418227e8b394fe97e545b2a and another thing that was of special interest to you was your own sock.
0x567d600247b0150fbfb1b98300d56d08a263004f you whined, ‘give me my sock.’
0x868285715de48536fff69b0e73e12bccec0e719f zametov hunted all about your room for your socks, and with his own scented, ring-bedecked fingers he gave you the rag.
0xb8b4f02f93b2448682901231cd6c6e2c829f85df and only then were you comforted, and for the next twenty-four hours you held the wretched thing in your hand; we could not get it from you.
0xaef27ac345465acfc329b73e8243f65472f60bb4 it is most likely somewhere under your quilt at this moment.
0xb4ff119eba20049791cd63da5428d5b3b6d2dd7f and then you asked so piteously for fringe for your trousers.
0x8cb6b8a6a1a677f5ba9465e46873fb00cb91d410 we tried to find out what sort of fringe, but we could not make it out.
0x26b23285457144b67b1c56773fcf9bccbdb3ede3 now to business!
0xd80d2dbc83b3744d7176966af2ee5b97ef80a605 here are thirty-five roubles; i take ten of them, and shall give you an account of them in an hour or two.
0xd15977a576939c0e7c6421f1d36b1e3ea1bef765 i will let zossimov know at the same time, though he ought to have been here long ago, for it is nearly twelve.
0x881d7fcc2ea9e0851bd33850cbb203184fc92870 and you, nastasya, look in pretty often while i am away, to see whether he wants a drink or anything else.
0x24939c338e5e8972f48eabfacff7321a0ff1f3ec and i will tell pashenka what is wanted myself.
0x7cd42f9696b71b22476e4f6adb5fcb8aa68153a8 good-bye!”
0x061f768bcb54be94edecacaa21763f6e06e6d662 “he calls her pashenka!
0x2466ed3bfc617a6539a6fbfce6da5aafb74ceabc ah, he’s a deep one!”
0x1256cb1c44a5e84463b9db731c13cccecd4b6b16 said nastasya as he went out; then she opened the door and stood listening, but could not resist running downstairs after him.
0xc16a98907e6cbf7fbcbf25838c2da88b7f826b42 she was very eager to hear what he would say to the landlady.
0x7e434021607314abf55cd87f664e34e10343d8db she was evidently quite fascinated by razumihin.
0x7f5b621cad6f97eb3202fdb811baf86dc567edb1 no sooner had she left the room than the sick man flung off the bedclothes and leapt out of bed like a madman.
0x1960c510fd19fc2aa13eb53e715fd71720728077 with burning, twitching impatience he had waited for them to be gone so that he might set to work.
0x80a6402d1eea064bda122ffa3a4c88237a83a7f1 but to what work?
0x92826ac5d79c27ddbf2321554e9ba7f5ed272dca now, as though to spite him, it eluded him.
0xc5e503a90b04b61310237936c6d8abc77dda5d71 “good god, only tell me one thing: do they know of it yet or not?
0x71c99592eaf93e48e2adff4806fe5ccae84e12b1 what if they know it and are only pretending, mocking me while i am laid up, and then they will come in and tell me that it’s been discovered long ago and that they have only... what am i to do now?
0xe2fa66a4d215a9613c0ff61759beb6953958d44d that’s what i’ve forgotten, as though on purpose; forgotten it all at once, i remembered a minute ago.”
0x32f8a77a60437c2fd5625d03e5d78d7261d51f54 he stood in the middle of the room and gazed in miserable bewilderment about him; he walked to the door, opened it, listened; but that was not what he wanted.
0xbea0be1bee6827790d16a46bdf770c775fd5fcec suddenly, as though recalling something, he rushed to the corner where there was a hole under the paper, began examining it, put his hand into the hole, fumbled--but that was not it.
0x66c9def73b87947581abc94ea65557af4958aac6 he went to the stove, opened it and began rummaging in the ashes; the frayed edges of his trousers and the rags cut off his pocket were lying there just as he had thrown them.
0x646386a73c9c9156fdb82f54f5ffe82868e89ffc no one had looked, then!
0xbc429d409fb799a48bc236dc3d16dc999d7c9f6f then he remembered the sock about which razumihin had just been telling him.
0x6b081020dc160b2fc43732624e0efbca8377344c yes, there it lay on the sofa under the quilt, but it was so covered with dust and grime that zametov could not have seen anything on it.
0x47e21d2b3bd05210eb22540b0d563f60b91c37c1 “bah, zametov!
0xce39ca1499dbc6e0807750736b356fc9b34144b5 the police office!
0xf7f4e791750872435c8c1d111b0e9a1185b7277c and why am i sent for to the police office?
0x7d22d6eee90cbe336bd4aade3bdaa05fff193f05 where’s the notice?
0x0cf87980b6ccbfa97a80c6661b8e769f1de660ef bah!
0xa2d27faaeff87fa7b0008f364b752ba7da59b0fc i am mixing it up; that was then.
0x679690fb60a2dfebd99c7ee8ac172570416052fe i looked at my sock then, too, but now... now i have been ill. but what did zametov come for?
0xe19fe930c678bc670a4f162102cd69776b449c7d why did razumihin bring him?”
0x9452024d25d42e0ced9be0c3fc77c107563f410d he muttered, helplessly sitting on the sofa again.
0x2a7c8cdce16d1b326f054c5a1ca7994b450e18a7 “what does it mean?
0x5874f466d4968a0138fdde416273b2e7ec3a43f7 am i still in delirium, or is it real?
0xc3149cd7e3282420ca93504847604a84efee434c i believe it is real.... ah, i remember; i must escape!
0x9f5943c20582c76511de01546ba3f33b41e8b9e0 make haste to escape.

0x2810e957e43e65f3443528c431374165c0d6833c yes... but where?
0x29b9e1bdb345e6b6cfb79e8829cf5554b35bcdf9 and where are my clothes?
0x9563ee4e85255ef9d2a23af691a8ad6f933a9fe6 i’ve no boots.
0x4456ff04e662caa4d450119dfa91ed86210ace93 they’ve taken them away!
0x0bc89d3197e3aef5625cdaf3f6071f98ffbc6cc5 they’ve hidden them!

0x1c526bfc3dfb879859245f8ace0890b32b93de3a ah, here is my coat--they passed that over!
0x4d2587e17b3b1eb4ae9fd75d16f3d614782ba003 and here is money on the table, thank god!
0x87dabca27257592123b3bba4723bb11f5c15d84b and here’s the i o u... i’ll take the money and go and take another lodging.
0x442371a15e41c9946b15ebfea72d3473bc6f3ca0 they won’t find me!... yes, but the address bureau?
0x813e4830c96104da664172a40e8ebd0168a45522 they’ll find me, razumihin will find me.
0x41db5c1f665e4c33696f449e05bf0be5b4849717 better escape altogether... far away... to america, and let them do their worst!
0xfdc949fbe242a4bcf16839478a31110a482c0ff0 and take the i o u... it would be of use there.... what else shall i take?
0x80b8e9821eacddadc4114b4003dc148b15caf9fb they think i am ill!
0x42489a0dcffe852c5da564a52cfeb9b05c91bc2f they don’t know that i can walk, ha-ha-ha!
0x47109dc7e32368119a676dce58e07640cb204224 i could see by their eyes that they know all about it!
0x40a839b4e4e4fcd7cfde34e46ca072bd1f89a4ed if only i could get downstairs!
0x6d107e0f20407868ebfc7225fc4c82ae3ec58fb2 and what if they have set a watch there--policemen!
0x2c73b6354ee51ace89feb9cf225c0fa6e55b56eb what’s this tea?
0xe12b53ff26738538b201ed107301ea535344dda7 ah, and here is beer left, half a bottle, cold!”
0x6bc23e29db1359a60f025463f1e8bcc1c3008fb2 he snatched up the bottle, which still contained a glassful of beer, and gulped it down with relish, as though quenching a flame in his breast.
0xe65250549b65cbdd87df17f98787fd84fd35326d but in another minute the beer had gone to his head, and a faint and even pleasant shiver ran down his spine.
0x4b1ece44861df947cd6c335bc331ee58a744de7e he lay down and pulled the quilt over him.
0xa11796911692e2bddc0bc03ffbb111e0565060da his sick and incoherent thoughts grew more and more disconnected, and soon a light, pleasant drowsiness came upon him.
0x59499b8ae6c39e5fe33f977fb6e3634c28615fd7 with a sense of comfort he nestled his head into the pillow, wrapped more closely about him the soft, wadded quilt which had replaced the old, ragged greatcoat, sighed softly and sank into a deep, sound, refreshing sleep.
0x1936c0300ba9e8ea1005f18b68e1b3eee3c9d2ef he woke up, hearing someone come in.
0x8177782919f571a31120d4441f44c47b8f3ce930 he opened his eyes and saw razumihin standing in the doorway, uncertain whether to come in or not.
0xa7855aeb581c7305660b27be56c2e8ed870c9961 raskolnikov sat up quickly on the sofa and gazed at him, as though trying to recall something.
0x8378fc9991eb3da1c11486bc1f7ef1e77519efb4 “ah, you are not asleep!
0x6e701ac64a3e4addd940e0a697ed941a0d7d6450 here i am!
0x94f9070694f61b3bdaaa12f2c1eee73eb5784d92 nastasya, bring in the parcel!”
0x099d63a2943c5995514ff20bf8c817003eaed0ed razumihin shouted down the stairs.
0x29e770a43c9901fc3ce55f7e30506ba9f93c07a6 “you shall have the account directly.”
0x1b9fabfbe6e5c9625bccea4a6913c4691ab3e9e7 “what time is it?”
0xacf6099bbfc0c4dff824a703c3be4483377f7a9f asked raskolnikov, looking round uneasily.
0x63a2dbce0d0395e4dac3f896b3f8f045f4d35cc2 “yes, you had a fine sleep, brother, it’s almost evening, it will be six o’clock directly.

0x30b4b680a4068d82e915c51a0631bf04e40c8078 “good heavens!

0xc46ccae45cab2762c5c549c1488bd4fa95191585 “and why not?
0x146695457b037c687d20da565c62db7fa3c4c451 it will do you good.
0xd844af7491a1cedee4c7e773296e62ef6ba326b1 what’s the hurry?

0x06dc9154c4ed20aae0518e3a5905a2e9ca848af6 “no, before.”

0x43d601ae6fdf07250f45d744fd4ce7e6a58453fe raskolnikov pondered.
0xf5c3acffae2e9d1585603e52cb1963fbb1ee2c15 the morning seemed like a dream to him.
0xc6c3a6615a20f060416cba795f9e62fc5bac66df he could not remember alone, and looked inquiringly at razumihin.
0xa16ad62dc1ad7c268e5634a34e55e23bb1d62e2c “hm!”
0xec2d1037710bae2fed0dc9af53b6ff44504f2742 said the latter, “he has forgotten.

0x70a467f35d21b237fe36ac988cfee32ede58136c look here, my dear boy.”
0x7a20baf3b0adcd7721baa72468dd70efd22fc5a1 he began untying the bundle, which evidently interested him.
0x48ce891dfa4d001becfa5f90429db6f254b96e2a “believe me, brother, this is something specially near my heart.
0xafcae0256ef9b004da2d4258c256c95593cd808e for we must make a man of you.
0xcd70f12758ff82bf66e8ee23f0aa32d047c6d2a9 let’s begin from the top.
0x6b1a54ee87314a7aa6eb2ba330d4daff9681e118 do you see this cap?”
0x555c5614beed1569f3566df860c9293bccd822dc he said, taking out of the bundle a fairly good though cheap and ordinary cap.
0x16f9653fedc1d3a4a290f7373436f357b49cf112 “let me try it on.”
0x58e73af89f60068d3a32cbe88fdc599ab61c74dc “presently, afterwards,” said raskolnikov, waving it off pettishly.
0xbeac5da87fee2834eff8d2fb3c7556523fdde0e2 “come, rodya, my boy, don’t oppose it, afterwards will be too late; and i shan’t sleep all night, for i bought it by guess, without measure.
0x0804c7431d8213aa014fe733853fb0f37a7ecac6 just right!”
0xe75b83a1454ed70b9853def74da058da5e40d2df he cried triumphantly, fitting it on, “just your size!
0x963946f41fbbbf831830cf00afba02eba6ccee52 a proper head-covering is the first thing in dress and a recommendation in its own way.
0x536ab3fe5f6791c3d59a2d115e863ca862985102 tolstyakov, a friend of mine, is always obliged to take off his pudding basin when he goes into any public place where other people wear their hats or caps.
0x4a88a3945573b686b03aebf4a99382df5dbfa194 people think he does it from slavish politeness, but it’s simply because he is ashamed of his bird’s nest; he is such a boastful fellow!
0xb7751fd5b4e3b8cd89ef33ed67bbb100ac105252 look, nastasya, here are two specimens of headgear: this palmerston”--he took from the corner raskolnikov’s old, battered hat, which for some unknown reason, he called a palmerston--“or this jewel!
0x38b0ede0f9718fd85194a066ff59ceb63275345c guess the price, rodya, what do you suppose i paid for it, nastasya!”
0xf09e8fbc6a211ceffdc2899146634a719a18d764 he said, turning to her, seeing that raskolnikov did not speak.
0x6bbccce6b58883fd0c43ef3a214f667ef7f53f2a “twenty copecks, no more, i dare say,” answered nastasya.
0xb74530ab3d910ac3a24eacfbd2cd10a1e1e2a9d5 “twenty copecks, silly!”
0xef7aef5f31863a905ffc604983d4f20450c15ab4 he cried, offended.
0x12a6658ce6888d195203b800edc20ac6a0299978 “why, nowadays you would cost more than that--eighty copecks!
0xeb58012a6626e07f09f0e8ddaafc3ca7a427cc32 and that only because it has been worn.
0x779587b8e783550f833382736a1ce5dc6df6f4e0 and it’s bought on condition that when’s it’s worn out, they will give you another next year.

0x1f02ba435b791d90110c37afbb7edc01024ddc21 well, now let us pass to the united states of america, as they called them at school.
0x2d75cbff99f511f50555beffd7984111e8613933 i assure you i am proud of these breeches,” and he exhibited to raskolnikov a pair of light, summer trousers of grey woollen material.
0xceff7c1f9511683b4bf9ac2049d7d14d7ed1f54d “no holes, no spots, and quite respectable, although a little worn; and a waistcoat to match, quite in the fashion.
0xa029090c8b7a0f5960b44aabdc824af1735cd0dc and its being worn really is an improvement, it’s softer, smoother.... you see, rodya, to my thinking, the great thing for getting on in the world is always to keep to the seasons; if you don’t insist on having asparagus in january, you keep your money in your purse; and it’s the same with this purchase.
0x7cad34f6b618d44cf98a9dc449a999008aea0124 it’s summer now, so i’ve been buying summer things--warmer materials will be wanted for autumn, so you will have to throw these away in any case... especially as they will be done for by then from their own lack of coherence if not your higher standard of luxury.
0xfd962fcc202b6033607e6db4b227b4f7fb5af465 come, price them!
0x73319c406b09ddd43cef4336649d563a33e11bd5 what do you say?

0x0a6efc45eb80b085cbf9bebae7be4ddddcd7ac45 and remember the condition: if you wear these out, you will have another suit for nothing!
0x453c6ffc60af1978ed0a11c57e49e523396acff0 they only do business on that system at fedyaev’s; if you’ve bought a thing once, you are satisfied for life, for you will never go there again of your own free will.
0x2b4b39fb857e7e84040bc00c4c9b5bfcde2add31 now for the boots.
0x73319c406b09ddd43cef4336649d563a33e11bd5 what do you say?
0xed7c76afcbd2a6aa52524854fcf10ec601438747 you see that they are a bit worn, but they’ll last a couple of months, for it’s foreign work and foreign leather; the secretary of the english embassy sold them last week--he had only worn them six days, but he was very short of cash.

0x83ce85ea0d07739e5d81065cf2ba1a6e1ab05ea7 a bargain?”
0x44825949a069d48a2ed56aa547a2bd628b7d91df “but perhaps they won’t fit,” observed nastasya.
0x4cd2b6350f46c6387ac3b601ab579f0624e60689 “not fit?
0x479dd3652a5300692e8756f4d7240a29effdb114 just look!”
0xa4114cc1c8cec7c71d403767bb16f3beae21aec7 and he pulled out of his pocket raskolnikov’s old, broken boot, stiffly coated with dry mud.
0x10f494a5dd7ce38b6e3ccab3cbc7ab02993641b8 “i did not go empty-handed--they took the size from this monster.
0xaec5d352e3abd516b331b1a762fa4ec7e0f312ec we all did our best.
0x43b19d03eebdf71ed4e98f17d14a13393c0f8421 and as to your linen, your landlady has seen to that.
0x825ed1c9271579ae0c34d0fa950393213ff226f0 here, to begin with are three shirts, hempen but with a fashionable front.... well now then, eighty copecks the cap, two roubles twenty-five copecks the suit--together three roubles five copecks--a rouble and a half for the boots--for, you see, they are very good--and that makes four roubles fifty-five copecks; five roubles for the underclothes--they were bought in the lot--which makes exactly nine roubles fifty-five copecks.
0x6906719bba385dffc76c8bfd520c7bfd3bd792a6 forty-five copecks change in coppers.
0x074b8694ccff3a629c534e00968bf337582df8bf will you take it?
0x070f6b3b7495d5968cb7457e02085433c41096f4 and so, rodya, you are set up with a complete new rig-out, for your overcoat will serve, and even has a style of its own.
0xebbf611910abbae534ea301959068dfa2f02ac0b that comes from getting one’s clothes from sharmer’s!
0xf50b308260807c5abb00a681d138c5f4bec4c78b as for your socks and other things, i leave them to you; we’ve twenty-five roubles left.
0x9ff8f7f72113a62df30567be4fb32a865ec5dbd1 and as for pashenka and paying for your lodging, don’t you worry.

0x7db57da49bb4c85a15e063b6b7190da37ec892d8 and now, brother, let me change your linen, for i daresay you will throw off your illness with your shirt.”
0x34ca7f930c5df32372178babcf6c62cf7de912a7 “let me be!
0x93efa88a8a5abe732073ec37a944b2fe611207cb i don’t want to!”
0x9d3a3c272e6cb397de94942b546184e636fe553a raskolnikov waved him off.
0xfa002bf88be6dd2322c358a881130ded3d1e0e33 he had listened with disgust to razumihin’s efforts to be playful about his purchases.
0xd797769ac86f7e7a5730d0a033c583ff64dfd4cb “come, brother, don’t tell me i’ve been trudging around for nothing,” razumihin insisted.
0x259b52fec9f4d206e9c417d9b998896d8a7f852a “nastasya, don’t be bashful, but help me--that’s it,” and in spite of raskolnikov’s resistance he changed his linen.
0xed176d706a5f92c888de6c2b76a2355c2b602041 the latter sank back on the pillows and for a minute or two said nothing.
0x9e6c595fad41f924722823cfe8ffb1cb5e9d7e0b “it will be long before i get rid of them,” he thought.
0x14f2d9edfa0fbb98185fd89c18872628a73f215c “what money was all that bought with?”
0x8c8b2db3132ce6e81fb83bf958a08806cd83048f he asked at last, gazing at the wall.
0x633e5da5f4241fc65fec765f7f4af4fb05c81279 “money?
0x5b89edbcb3854f1eb9616e1718e3f2c555c64014 why, your own, what the messenger brought from vahrushin, your mother sent it.
0xce1f63e6937a203ae25380bb486c1e72f5e845d3 have you forgotten that, too?”
0x5fd7c2fd3c78539339f475a0e5848ec0dfa7eb57 “i remember now,” said raskolnikov after a long, sullen silence.
0xf7047b16ecb894251df4295ebbaef01523377c04 razumihin looked at him, frowning and uneasy.
0x30fd9a7ca1e00c936c7c0e9ae0446135d69d7056 the door opened and a tall, stout man whose appearance seemed familiar to raskolnikov came in.
0xf6248f533a90a0ab60b1165abb83982af938fd5b chapter iv zossimov was a tall, fat man with a puffy, colourless, clean-shaven face and straight flaxen hair.
0xc7d990540f06c3f23eccc9b2499f6662e9e41aa1 he wore spectacles, and a big gold ring on his fat finger.
0xf5a1f8885c82e3d23865176b16e1193e700e8d96 he was twenty-seven.
0x11daee251fec6711086480d46601ab9abfdb5563 he had on a light grey fashionable loose coat, light summer trousers, and everything about him loose, fashionable and spick and span; his linen was irreproachable, his watch-chain was massive.
0x518f5c0721ebb7caa8e69b552bb71cbc2697a8d2 in manner he was slow and, as it were, nonchalant, and at the same time studiously free and easy; he made efforts to conceal his self-importance, but it was apparent at every instant.
0x507a177c3f1e544849f983546c3e037cf9e05825 all his acquaintances found him tedious, but said he was clever at his work.
0x889ff78fa1df7780f1e639c12da18ff91fd34b5d “i’ve been to you twice to-day, brother.
0x2920fdf9a380141e0b18240e56709dbfabd180df you see, he’s come to himself,” cried razumihin.
0x1cc0c58cb563f5a139eaa665ffb6e01808ee4b7d “i see, i see; and how do we feel now, eh?”
0x95ffc27e07d2c37d45983fcdcaca5a52b2a8ce49 said zossimov to raskolnikov, watching him carefully and, sitting down at the foot of the sofa, he settled himself as comfortably as he could.
0x714a6262ae7903b1117c8e4648f7c0f735be51ad “he is still depressed,” razumihin went on.
0xcbaa0c64de08e08404825f5c2ea2dda38f78e425 “we’ve just changed his linen and he almost cried.”
0x31d4d270f9542d2052c3357527d0e65c7fb94d7f “that’s very natural; you might have put it off if he did not wish it.... his pulse is first-rate.

0x08612dfa14b41c37f00e68def7f3351d0ac7d1e0 “i am well, i am perfectly well!”
0x2178f513619a4ced12d1d9d76370d77c1f1fa06d raskolnikov declared positively and irritably.
0xe70ca286a0543b656cedffacf38fdb8d5fa93891 he raised himself on the sofa and looked at them with glittering eyes, but sank back on to the pillow at once and turned to the wall.
0x040c78e5d1c403d96cb825f2c2496b50f49e19f9 zossimov watched him intently.

0x408565d0c0d5568d9cb60da9aee41c4437ff429b “has he eaten anything?”
0x5e376d5ee0cf6ca8f35e76efa8677d835e848a65 they told him, and asked what he might have.
0x38b381a9047f23035f8c11ccae27655c3a38df8d “he may have anything... soup, tea... mushrooms and cucumbers, of course, you must not give him; he’d better not have meat either, and... but no need to tell you that!”
0x640368955dc3980b5545c9354c8dfcc3bf0a51f3 razumihin and he looked at each other.

0x2bc6316e78edb29140558d2397a104bae409e911 you are worked by principles, as it were by springs; you won’t venture to turn round on your own account.

0x8dfc7b2850e0db0f4dc352840924e5f5c86797c5 zametov is a delightful person.”
0x77dbe467cefac5a2e49a643fe585032f94565e92 “though he does take bribes.”

0xe63e5f4738824a6896fc99881504d6691c2865b2 and what of it?
0xea0f3b18164171d89177e5eee7f8b80f90be290f i don’t care if he does take bribes,” razumihin cried with unnatural irritability.
0x924b51c64d579dac88a7800095ea36fcb21a04de “i don’t praise him for taking bribes.

0x397877d50951320f8bf7cd3173d35bb680a9312b but if one looks at men in all ways--are there many good ones left?
0xabf02ae70609421f48893156333c7cb8bdb9cb3e why, i am sure i shouldn’t be worth a baked onion myself... perhaps with you thrown in.”
0x3e3c95cc7c90dc15f0c178d169aca1fbed750728 “that’s too little; i’d give two for you.”
0xb67f539fe0013f1ad4858ada7f89d88f9522ebc7 “and i wouldn’t give more than one for you.

0x88c2f3d6fe39069e667490f791a17e09d733c8c3 zametov is no more than a boy.

0x32c811181caabd155a48be6d1f95dfbda9720882 you’ll never improve a man by repelling him, especially a boy.
0xd828937c9da290fbbed9a11da345cae788984bfb one has to be twice as careful with a boy.

0x8ceda9c73066a3966e183f72151846c2ccbe94c3 you don’t understand.
0x06730a3a61aecb6e44776767701f78501f79e3d9 you harm yourselves running another man down.... but if you want to know, we really have something in common.”
0x14550e0df1698880fc9e2d6587e9f406b0768289 “i should like to know what.”
0x9c50e5c93a1fb0bed3f433d3002cfa0a9fa7365b “why, it’s all about a house-painter.... we are getting him out of a mess!
0x5160a0cc797855e8ba2a524258fac67130d4ef46 though indeed there’s nothing to fear now.
0x6e551e016cff0574d3d3e344af470e34929f8b77 the matter is absolutely self-evident.
0xd9ea08df47a5634b130c87f211d02ca78c403573 we only put on steam.”
0xa485d407b6d76ac0171f0f7f4ba6ba769608a0d8 “a painter?”
0x7f30ffe12cfc0bcca69116c48d3b9efcbaf6bdb9 “why, haven’t i told you about it?
0xf306940d8ca34d98fe61c7f879d1dd5b6eaa2902 i only told you the beginning then about the murder of the old pawnbroker-woman.
0xee941a8efe0251fa6c848304ef7b3b263b59ff2b well, the painter is mixed up in it...” “oh, i heard about that murder before and was rather interested in it... partly... for one reason.... i read about it in the papers, too....” “lizaveta was murdered, too,” nastasya blurted out, suddenly addressing raskolnikov.
0x34152c740db2825431872f226676e42e1d4f8023 she remained in the room all the time, standing by the door listening.
0xa3f855bf0b9440c62be28ace42ca022a2124d0b0 “lizaveta,” murmured raskolnikov hardly audibly.
0x3b39af08514c3748d4f2f24c9a598fcf77ebf98d “lizaveta, who sold old clothes.
0x07caa46da4d06a257e807cf34e17d18f6bc0433f didn’t you know her?
0x627375a9247c0c92a4992797e176c4b36bca5aca she used to come here.
0xe211dfd2edfe40dfdd6b853c3b5bbe4d0ebe91a2 she mended a shirt for you, too.”
0xe4818ec8bb1e69e18bd98828468707b6eaae9c1f raskolnikov turned to the wall where in the dirty, yellow paper he picked out one clumsy, white flower with brown lines on it and began examining how many petals there were in it, how many scallops in the petals and how many lines on them.
0x34801016fbcc5a7fb9d623b04acb10e8a6c739be he felt his arms and legs as lifeless as though they had been cut off.
0x62adb28b24270d3ce301c6fc95fcd77468a5fd7a he did not attempt to move, but stared obstinately at the flower.
0xa3a421824fa19444dcb7a2289c34945b711ed951 “but what about the painter?”
0x1c18be48bf906b48c1712ca809733c9a91740967 zossimov interrupted nastasya’s chatter with marked displeasure.
0x0478f939b8975f921b73a9a4e55e3b03807b9aad she sighed and was silent.
0x5b903dade2c5ae87ddff676d3c450f2334b58c33 “why, he was accused of the murder,” razumihin went on hotly.
0x3ae65b69ae745509f19bda0ebc18be234831598e “was there evidence against him then?”
0xca65c514c1217181ac66dc6430135445e1f44f06 “evidence, indeed!
0x166a110b3e109026f0a4eb9786b8bab52b1e4a76 evidence that was no evidence, and that’s what we have to prove.
0x089eb52b06a715aad018b5f60efd2fa99e83bd2d it was just as they pitched on those fellows, koch and pestryakov, at first.
0x4bf3e335199107182c6f7638efaad377acc7f452 foo!
0x93856551d6c340381967ee7ce3788a81b6b93cc3 how stupidly it’s all done, it makes one sick, though it’s not one’s business!
0x97a1f0870b245fbf688ef6004df536bc8c8c3148 pestryakov may be coming to-night.... by the way, rodya, you’ve heard about the business already; it happened before you were ill, the day before you fainted at the police office while they were talking about it.”
0x6c3cc4aa3fecb22d78f025828a09d9ec4ce2453a zossimov looked curiously at raskolnikov.
0xe28993060bba0aee16488fb18eaeeb9b853a386c he did not stir.
0xcc88d2f54c426502659c81fe315522ec83717a78 “but i say, razumihin, i wonder at you.
0xac8d724299cd82fdb088edae042bb8a1a4fb8539 what a busybody you are!”
0x2c8e7674ce29d64a770fea02dc1598052b73b4f8 zossimov observed.
0x6af7100aac8f13eea0c445ae38aef14b6f674ec1 “maybe i am, but we will get him off anyway,” shouted razumihin, bringing his fist down on the table.
0xdbed0edb5a75ed050017edf3c43b7c6597b203dd “what’s the most offensive is not their lying--one can always forgive lying--lying is a delightful thing, for it leads to truth--what is offensive is that they lie and worship their own lying.... i respect porfiry, but... what threw them out at first?
0xf863c1f10a1640bf3464f276ed7d435ec858d1ed the door was locked, and when they came back with the porter it was open.
0x721bc57da40d5637f9f847ff10985536af1b6f94 so it followed that koch and pestryakov were the murderers--that was their logic!”
0xa9e5c77e2907fb00649aff0d83ed542b16098db6 “but don’t excite yourself; they simply detained them, they could not help that.... and, by the way, i’ve met that man koch.
0xc213f4427bc9ad9817abcaf7d8280d593c5ab428 he used to buy unredeemed pledges from the old woman?
0x4298cf3558a3cc31a033e3e9131e8f0cf20f3e6a eh?”
0x220e4fe3855492160bd28cd8b1906cf200e336f4 “yes, he is a swindler.
0xba61650e2355bdc367855f3c3119a9076506a10a he buys up bad debts, too.
0x7f6fdf3e8ea5c118dbfe2cbf4ac2de3062eeedda he makes a profession of it.
0x62aa6bce2df08ea41364db31f1814704925ec1b1 but enough of him!
0x7ebc30efbb1b21211951c42e1b7287953899fbe3 do you know what makes me angry?
0xf1cbb85a64f62572af9aedd920570d4a71be0950 it’s their sickening rotten, petrified routine.... and this case might be the means of introducing a new method.
0x241a79452ba4ca34263406ee827f056a40b16cd0 one can show from the psychological data alone how to get on the track of the real man.
0xbbb686c36de4efb17e63bb68467e2f8385173cf5 ‘we have facts,’ they say.
0x8284b480ffe2c2359f6a633d6ce18ea9cbd273af but facts are not everything--at least half the business lies in how you interpret them!”
0xdda85baf99df41695be835b977ca96bf66ea5c9f “can you interpret them, then?”
0x39e90a8d1d52ac324f1e84b549d3a9fa9adeb244 “anyway, one can’t hold one’s tongue when one has a feeling, a tangible feeling, that one might be a help if only.... eh!

0x0b792cbcf64ea1e5cd357c5a38a0d96aca63d62d “i am waiting to hear about the painter.”
0x4ff1d630a5dfd54766646d787799dea0fd5c9485 “oh, yes!
0xf845ec6422411841acddd05985f622f0acea5350 well, here’s the story.
0xd676c8f1f8e1c465ac8073411c4c3ba4502e05c8 early on the third day after the murder, when they were still dandling koch and pestryakov--though they accounted for every step they took and it was as plain as a pikestaff--an unexpected fact turned up.
0x8c6996f16fae84d8cc5489d446739de73461ec74 a peasant called dushkin, who keeps a dram-shop facing the house, brought to the police office a jeweller’s case containing some gold ear-rings, and told a long rigamarole.
0xdad8be2cd9f4ec982b789d3c43fe06932d6a6a9d ‘the day before yesterday, just after eight o’clock’--mark the day and the hour!--‘a journeyman house-painter, nikolay, who had been in to see me already that day, brought me this box of gold ear-rings and stones, and asked me to give him two roubles for them.
0xa84ab0914ca3bebd43e0d3261b358a095b3b0770 when i asked him where he got them, he said that he picked them up in the street.
0xa458f00c7b9bb6e3e2f2f1ae0436291ce3753680 i did not ask him anything more.’
0x60bca6afddc0813536f010f14af3d51336ca0fe1 i am telling you dushkin’s story.
0x9f6552a3657ad8b6e9c7ad1d4563a04360855481 ‘i gave him a note’--a rouble that is--‘for i thought if he did not pawn it with me he would with another.
0x161b9c49ee212b5c3fc67575a725263c0ae4ff11 it would all come to the same thing--he’d spend it on drink, so the thing had better be with me.
0xb7938dfae9e497f885e16fbe0333258c82dd6b91 the further you hide it the quicker you will find it, and if anything turns up, if i hear any rumours, i’ll take it to the police.’
0xe8a6ab00bdfd8ce27b3e43df267a816b0b0a68f7 of course, that’s all taradiddle; he lies like a horse, for i know this dushkin, he is a pawnbroker and a receiver of stolen goods, and he did not cheat nikolay out of a thirty-rouble trinket in order to give it to the police.
0xed39e2dec8b291d6fa33c070f1ec4a6f71dc780d he was simply afraid.
0x8d7b51d9bdda405e9962829269e20dee02f0be4d but no matter, to return to dushkin’s story.
0x4f291a90d21659b758fd6ccc8d7f5de6bf45c0b8 ‘i’ve known this peasant, nikolay dementyev, from a child; he comes from the same province and district of zaraïsk, we are both ryazan men.
0x863b450f9b64fe42d6a8856f275559d00311e06d and though nikolay is not a drunkard, he drinks, and i knew he had a job in that house, painting work with dmitri, who comes from the same village, too.
0x0f3d86da4084ac0faf761a043c294acd98d18026 as soon as he got the rouble he changed it, had a couple of glasses, took his change and went out.
0x6ca6566a684ae19f6f31c54c900f2be086ca697c but i did not see dmitri with him then.
0xd7f246fdb4aa26ba28c5ae173dd06dc101e836a7 and the next day i heard that someone had murdered alyona ivanovna and her sister, lizaveta ivanovna, with an axe.
0xa8a27afe195170605c136e0f616b90bda38de0aa i knew them, and i felt suspicious about the ear-rings at once, for i knew the murdered woman lent money on pledges.
0xd14898eac2474971a032cbbcd1e339873a8d44d0 i went to the house, and began to make careful inquiries without saying a word to anyone.
0x8e1d4e88c670c5dcb02c8cbc8cb78fbe21c79c29 first of all i asked, “is nikolay here?”
0xea6094018096017b515a7fb11252ed1e08bfa7c0 dmitri told me that nikolay had gone off on the spree; he had come home at daybreak drunk, stayed in the house about ten minutes, and went out again.
0x14b6edfb402b5fc791ca845ee6012b5bd35b37b7 dmitri didn’t see him again and is finishing the job alone.
0x99c9d4864b876912add2f02283adb6bd0817de05 and their job is on the same staircase as the murder, on the second floor.
0x3c7de8f9bb6f68d543df3b8ff87732c7f774bcd8 when i heard all that i did not say a word to anyone’--that’s dushkin’s tale--‘but i found out what i could about the murder, and went home feeling as suspicious as ever.
0x59a0680bfda4686ecaef033828b086283e2d3b56 and at eight o’clock this morning’--that was the third day, you understand--‘i saw nikolay coming in, not sober, though not to say very drunk--he could understand what was said to him.
0x58f27ed3bf165e27af350a9c3afa3d2f50ac0d86 he sat down on the bench and did not speak.
0x4ef3c0fb8d42891a52b2a99f0e3bcac305b32844 there was only one stranger in the bar and a man i knew asleep on a bench and our two boys.
0x8e72d811f336dd605f34ed003e1573c3da8741ad “have you seen dmitri?”
0x9b63583ffd2abddbf0bf2911a5c251d0a6bfa228 said i.
0x547de6d455d6851e2bf0ed5c3ca50f51fab1150d “no, i haven’t,” said he.
0xfc009d74696f2f8f14202cea0d3c6c7cb2958dce “and you’ve not been here either?”
0xcf3e65e30956930a7e99ceb57d514a046c9912eb “not since the day before yesterday,” said he.
0x6d63c315d074dccc5cf402d0bd97a11008f08e4a “and where did you sleep last night?”
0xe6d8cf8732dfc3b75ce7346bb43dfd9f2fa281e3 “in peski, with the kolomensky men.”
0xf1337b478aabf4c00fa66291bf816ef2c967bc7a “and where did you get those ear-rings?”
0x74fba75b701a9a376d9f1a640dd1fdd9851ddde4 i asked.
0x6da9f22593df4fc81ebe5e9871ac8741bd019d39 “i found them in the street,” and the way he said it was a bit queer; he did not look at me.
0x804ae221f024b847eb83eab03c5154df5cd36528 “did you hear what happened that very evening, at that very hour, on that same staircase?”
0x9b63583ffd2abddbf0bf2911a5c251d0a6bfa228 said i.
0x194c96ce85d3beebfa833053d500a9a972ae3c21 “no,” said he, “i had not heard,” and all the while he was listening, his eyes were staring out of his head and he turned as white as chalk.
0x1eba3456e5fe115d17e91c920d28edd825f12069 i told him all about it and he took his hat and began getting up.
0xe47a00a906b868e2ca0b66aedb73de5d36afaefd i wanted to keep him.
0xddb2838287c0303e0f228c9164a5cef768d25c39 “wait a bit, nikolay,” said i, “won’t you have a drink?”
0x1d360937d535ef401312019b9600cd775b5a29b5 and i signed to the boy to hold the door, and i came out from behind the bar; but he darted out and down the street to the turning at a run.
0x3c0b26e377a7dc673f5798850eb75d70ea62e9d7 i have not seen him since.
0x40692f815c7141250c93ae420d2057c8ffff6e30 then my doubts were at an end--it was his doing, as clear as could be....’” “i should think so,” said zossimov.
0x218b49d5fa8ad3c60aff120a8baf6803131bfeb6 “wait!
0x0d62605dd8b1e321728f7f128b64f14f2eb71d14 hear the end.
0x169f584cfdaa15317a74e2832cb239964b180a3d of course they sought high and low for nikolay; they detained dushkin and searched his house; dmitri, too, was arrested; the kolomensky men also were turned inside out.
0xeea9306d6feb1709fdca8496fd46d311a122b2b8 and the day before yesterday they arrested nikolay in a tavern at the end of the town.
0x7b577812e352c68bde04125e77906c0406701444 he had gone there, taken the silver cross off his neck and asked for a dram for it.
0xc26c1cdef558dddcf27e15f830f99379f70b08a1 they gave it to him.
0x59589b990bdd2a563a018d340920c1e838662f19 a few minutes afterwards the woman went to the cowshed, and through a crack in the wall she saw in the stable adjoining he had made a noose of his sash from the beam, stood on a block of wood, and was trying to put his neck in the noose.
0x7cb666ad1e034e3ccff4834f4cabd24f3cc875c0 the woman screeched her hardest; people ran in.
0x07b87a2e2ca3df74a6cbfdade2a58c4b1bbfac61 ‘so that’s what you are up to!’
0x26c40018600bf030a0d1ceab56014b85b572a680 ‘take me,’ he says, ‘to such-and-such a police officer; i’ll confess everything.’
0x4d4e6f4048d934381195f2894428e7ebc93cc958 well, they took him to that police station--that is here--with a suitable escort.
0x8a1e1738f249a00b5ad1458f841d5a72bbb80aa2 so they asked him this and that, how old he is, ‘twenty-two,’ and so on.
0x3a646dd0c31e4b9c765239d736f5f26523fea81d at the question, ‘when you were working with dmitri, didn’t you see anyone on the staircase at such-and-such a time?’--answer: ‘to be sure folks may have gone up and down, but i did not notice them.’

0x163c1c96ae1dd8f492b0c607a94cbc58abb6a02c they’d just killed them, not five or ten minutes before, for the bodies were still warm, and at once, leaving the flat open, knowing that people would go there at once, flinging away their booty, they rolled about like children, laughing and attracting general attention.

0xc02587eee4fc14bce32bb087d8f3da7f85f3ab00 and if the ear-rings being found in nikolay’s hands at the very day and hour of the murder constitutes an important piece of circumstantial evidence against him--although the explanation given by him accounts for it, and therefore it does not tell seriously against him--one must take into consideration the facts which prove him innocent, especially as they are facts that _cannot be denied_.
0xa438c3cc095c3195c138d35515a2fb4eaebc8d4e and do you suppose, from the character of our legal system, that they will accept, or that they are in a position to accept, this fact--resting simply on a psychological impossibility--as irrefutable and conclusively breaking down the circumstantial evidence for the prosecution?
0x3dc86b37ac7f5501b85342e7f517c02dcd664299 no, they won’t accept it, they certainly won’t, because they found the jewel-case and the man tried to hang himself, ‘which he could not have done if he hadn’t felt guilty.’

0x97f86e3a0e90baa43a7e14979fde0acdd99c028c koch, like an ass, did not stay at the door; so the murderer popped out and ran down, too; for he had no other way of escape.
0x7b07374bbc7b3d375bea555f52e711d8592e3aff he hid from koch, pestryakov and the porter in the flat when nikolay and dmitri had just run out of it.

0xf9a9926b5fe322591412f3acdb482d9edb3f67d7 razumihin was exclaiming, but at that moment the door opened and a personage came in who was a stranger to all present.
0xa0081deda1ac6b7684bb27a91e949ca19e4255d4 chapter v this was a gentleman no longer young, of a stiff and portly appearance, and a cautious and sour countenance.
0x47d6f7e99ac8faab1336ab3e4f3b0eeada94485a he began by stopping short in the doorway, staring about him with offensive and undisguised astonishment, as though asking himself what sort of place he had come to.
0x01eb870ca36ce2ac97aa90422ba90e1a5c9785c8 mistrustfully and with an affectation of being alarmed and almost affronted, he scanned raskolnikov’s low and narrow “cabin.”
0x6b847f8b4530185c3e27572c00198229f2124fc8 with the same amazement he stared at raskolnikov, who lay undressed, dishevelled, unwashed, on his miserable dirty sofa, looking fixedly at him.
0xd7dd041cf59e67b757c4e6e70fe7efb5cebc9865 then with the same deliberation he scrutinised the uncouth, unkempt figure and unshaven face of razumihin, who looked him boldly and inquiringly in the face without rising from his seat.
0xb3c9315ff421196ec4688d3fb54578541ad980e3 a constrained silence lasted for a couple of minutes, and then, as might be expected, some scene-shifting took place.
0x6d23bb1e37b9df5fc60d1f082674745e1dbf303e reflecting, probably from certain fairly unmistakable signs, that he would get nothing in this “cabin” by attempting to overawe them, the gentleman softened somewhat, and civilly, though with some severity, emphasising every syllable of his question, addressed zossimov: “rodion romanovitch raskolnikov, a student, or formerly a student?”
0xeb390afa9adedbc31d7910a49bcd4ab7a30d46a0 zossimov made a slight movement, and would have answered, had not razumihin anticipated him.
0x1460dcc489c390cf636ce08d42b6fbcbd41a5c20 “here he is lying on the sofa!
0x52aaff5156f81a630137cf1f6ec5b7861978feb3 what do you want?”
0x020cd2c9ed3e0acecb41e638a48c51b573153c6c this familiar “what do you want” seemed to cut the ground from the feet of the pompous gentleman.
0x2ec86d94afcc1c588b84010e73374c34557a9781 he was turning to razumihin, but checked himself in time and turned to zossimov again.
0xf4469aca17a3f3b1d83717aa7d0a2c66e4074230 “this is raskolnikov,” mumbled zossimov, nodding towards him.
0x24f548f7d76eafd11506ff2b6a1223894dc5cca5 then he gave a prolonged yawn, opening his mouth as wide as possible.
0x2eea21ebd903dff37764fdab72f61179756331b1 then he lazily put his hand into his waistcoat-pocket, pulled out a huge gold watch in a round hunter’s case, opened it, looked at it and as slowly and lazily proceeded to put it back.
0xf0acff2a23d320a538e0025232b9ba489f276b0c raskolnikov himself lay without speaking, on his back, gazing persistently, though without understanding, at the stranger.
0xe9190aada382cf2d387235896add5162dd88c96d now that his face was turned away from the strange flower on the paper, it was extremely pale and wore a look of anguish, as though he had just undergone an agonising operation or just been taken from the rack.
0x0e140f04a57fcda540cd86fe2835674900953f1c but the new-comer gradually began to arouse his attention, then his wonder, then suspicion and even alarm.
0x958f1f214a50de4c23e42d1811f2a941378b2736 when zossimov said “this is raskolnikov” he jumped up quickly, sat on the sofa and with an almost defiant, but weak and breaking, voice articulated: “yes, i am raskolnikov!
0x52aaff5156f81a630137cf1f6ec5b7861978feb3 what do you want?”
0xc027e073ff678c162be922d345b42dd2fdd78fc1 the visitor scrutinised him and pronounced impressively: “pyotr petrovitch luzhin.
0x1fc78eb86a3024258e4373570c4a95e080d7dff6 i believe i have reason to hope that my name is not wholly unknown to you?”
0xc52742b9859637c516eb4c31d5ba5d7007125464 but raskolnikov, who had expected something quite different, gazed blankly and dreamily at him, making no reply, as though he heard the name of pyotr petrovitch for the first time.
0xc793fa5c715012730b49b8fbc5d4996873812aa2 “is it possible that you can up to the present have received no information?”
0x5a6284f1f95ce7029ad2720d398c18e3265a24c2 asked pyotr petrovitch, somewhat disconcerted.
0xb7572a9357e4ac0307a00de8371cb4da42a9a4ef in reply raskolnikov sank languidly back on the pillow, put his hands behind his head and gazed at the ceiling.
0x28e83c6668efb966c77d1dd076ec5cb83d48f9a0 a look of dismay came into luzhin’s face.
0xcf5bc5115ce40ff106b0aff83913a2e708d925be zossimov and razumihin stared at him more inquisitively than ever, and at last he showed unmistakable signs of embarrassment.
0xe8d7b9d448128925f78103fcef5300f1f78fc939 “i had presumed and calculated,” he faltered, “that a letter posted more than ten days, if not a fortnight ago...” “i say, why are you standing in the doorway?”
0xa45dc0903239179d91ec3bc573504c315d34bedb razumihin interrupted suddenly.
0x4b2c6c125a2e2c9cea740845272bc79ed815fe6a “if you’ve something to say, sit down.
0x6c25adcb3c0558940e6f44eb7ba1c2bcaa72fd99 nastasya and you are so crowded.
0x8234217cad485f67be14284845a500bd4c1c1b72 nastasya, make room.
0x20e0cba7e829fd82d1600eed91f2a138ed34522e here’s a chair, thread your way in!”
0xcdd3e434cbf30bd8495c671d0d5890aab3500bf0 he moved his chair back from the table, made a little space between the table and his knees, and waited in a rather cramped position for the visitor to “thread his way in.”
0xc2335ecac8c13fa7e5a3b9db6fcbd08574366f5e the minute was so chosen that it was impossible to refuse, and the visitor squeezed his way through, hurrying and stumbling.
0x151e7c0eb31e2fc26f69c6b3d4fe0d33f6173eb5 reaching the chair, he sat down, looking suspiciously at razumihin.
0x6f3e7ab2b92eb39738df8d7d8faba7a6c9d1be96 “no need to be nervous,” the latter blurted out.
0xe51772c1968f2e650742238aa23ade7f74274848 “rodya has been ill for the last five days and delirious for three, but now he is recovering and has got an appetite.
0x934c4ccbe9499ca6948374630c7e1fc8f31d0aed this is his doctor, who has just had a look at him.
0x610d0fe1fc71d13c9c48ea39db491ec09a750127 i am a comrade of rodya’s, like him, formerly a student, and now i am nursing him; so don’t you take any notice of us, but go on with your business.”
0x32265bcc8e85751cc4694308e6a450846f6bb0e2 “thank you.
0xf8c22b65f79c8037088397ce8d79e7296bbf5d72 but shall i not disturb the invalid by my presence and conversation?”
0xcd660e6b94d26e77dcfd1d6a1b3f832caad3906c pyotr petrovitch asked of zossimov.
0xac9f0c52a174b572f3991280a5a55cf5a4f8497b “n-no,” mumbled zossimov; “you may amuse him.”
0x85ec3eb8a88ddfdd0eb5ce424923b3a5cac676ee he yawned again.
0xa5dfc9f9669f00d71c1b09785c00df795af8b84b “he has been conscious a long time, since the morning,” went on razumihin, whose familiarity seemed so much like unaffected good-nature that pyotr petrovitch began to be more cheerful, partly, perhaps, because this shabby and impudent person had introduced himself as a student.
0xab59b7a22338a12c843e17da778185c9864d84ff “your mamma,” began luzhin.
0xa16ad62dc1ad7c268e5634a34e55e23bb1d62e2c “hm!”
0x556127192aa8e36abc55f79f833cacf5985910a8 razumihin cleared his throat loudly.
0xab126a971db1309980edd506f0b02dcb93c7f7dc luzhin looked at him inquiringly.
0x86295ae6f9c2dd4f3cdf5911e969262dc3f9172c “that’s all right, go on.”
0x02f63eda32d1867f1225ffe4741106eab8cd3f2a luzhin shrugged his shoulders.
0xe1011ce11a09ed436b231bfde5a041e71fd08506 “your mamma had commenced a letter to you while i was sojourning in her neighbourhood.
0x415cc782d1cb568794211bdf67406a6c4e5dd5c4 on my arrival here i purposely allowed a few days to elapse before coming to see you, in order that i might be fully assured that you were in full possession of the tidings; but now, to my astonishment...” “i know, i know!”
0xebaf5ec0bf62c6678e4495f0d637c525e87b2539 raskolnikov cried suddenly with impatient vexation.
0x82d94e82e25c376078a311b52493a2345c2d2b57 “so you are the _fiancé_?
0x0ed1d5600cf891797be18f72bc03c56715612405 i know, and that’s enough!”
0xe4b65bcd6b40540a477a0d8091bccbb4911324bb there was no doubt about pyotr petrovitch’s being offended this time, but he said nothing.
0x840a090156170dcdabbf3db469c169b02d128620 he made a violent effort to understand what it all meant.
0x0e535da1fa13d2e5ed9aec87ce19748aad6212a9 there was a moment’s silence.
0xcf7aa01ef21a70f5de61261774c868f118ad1cc2 meanwhile raskolnikov, who had turned a little towards him when he answered, began suddenly staring at him again with marked curiosity, as though he had not had a good look at him yet, or as though something new had struck him; he rose from his pillow on purpose to stare at him.
0x0562186065e2d29bc9d414f052f590ada6d61dc3 there certainly was something peculiar in pyotr petrovitch’s whole appearance, something which seemed to justify the title of “fiancé” so unceremoniously applied to him.
0xc36d27a4273e1191ecc36aee7483c4ef5678d253 in the first place, it was evident, far too much so indeed, that pyotr petrovitch had made eager use of his few days in the capital to get himself up and rig himself out in expectation of his betrothed--a perfectly innocent and permissible proceeding, indeed.
0xbc3d84165b85362f346b5ff5acba1dbc55adb3a5 even his own, perhaps too complacent, consciousness of the agreeable improvement in his appearance might have been forgiven in such circumstances, seeing that pyotr petrovitch had taken up the rôle of fiancé.
0x801c1c998a17f64e4da806b55674f57a3bd94e37 all his clothes were fresh from the tailor’s and were all right, except for being too new and too distinctly appropriate.
0xf71226454ee3eb87fd8acd26122e65b8253466da even the stylish new round hat had the same significance.
0xb454fd56bab91401c87c78851e987d67f2ff3d28 pyotr petrovitch treated it too respectfully and held it too carefully in his hands.
0xb7632f2a98cd928bc18c1d8e1db1ba4adc8fed0b the exquisite pair of lavender gloves, real louvain, told the same tale, if only from the fact of his not wearing them, but carrying them in his hand for show.
0xfa753f8450862fae95f49ab1ca4eca1c07ba7b00 light and youthful colours predominated in pyotr petrovitch’s attire.
0xa795525418b42c7f0980b9dd0212d727b291dc1e he wore a charming summer jacket of a fawn shade, light thin trousers, a waistcoat of the same, new and fine linen, a cravat of the lightest cambric with pink stripes on it, and the best of it was, this all suited pyotr petrovitch.
0x9bd236ec7b70efeb1c31ac7c0719dcbec7f5c6c0 his very fresh and even handsome face looked younger than his forty-five years at all times.
0x08d45f54a671adafb1cdc011f3e4ce7dfff7014c his dark, mutton-chop whiskers made an agreeable setting on both sides, growing thickly upon his shining, clean-shaven chin.
0x8724cdf3cafa7bbb718401a2a6e83ccb1fb713e7 even his hair, touched here and there with grey, though it had been combed and curled at a hairdresser’s, did not give him a stupid appearance, as curled hair usually does, by inevitably suggesting a german on his wedding-day.
0x172dfc12cda497f544dbd58a4683716dd7845a38 if there really was something unpleasing and repulsive in his rather good-looking and imposing countenance, it was due to quite other causes.
0xdb051c52fc5c223098b7f9e2091dabbeb262fe50 after scanning mr. luzhin unceremoniously, raskolnikov smiled malignantly, sank back on the pillow and stared at the ceiling as before.
0x3cb6445f5b0ea096989052405ef1728cb70bb2be but mr. luzhin hardened his heart and seemed to determine to take no notice of their oddities.
0x04fcb3176524e6f701f45125a3e08c6c2aded6e8 “i feel the greatest regret at finding you in this situation,” he began, again breaking the silence with an effort.
0x7061a720693f15886bbd1a8f07935f05ddbaf9c9 “if i had been aware of your illness i should have come earlier.
0xd97b65b682640239e1a6b62e7ead7e850f261414 but you know what business is.
0x17aad3119639c98d8fc424e996b7d5eef65e1fd5 i have, too, a very important legal affair in the senate, not to mention other preoccupations which you may well conjecture.
0xc937ebb988157ea19acee5de7503be038b856897 i am expecting your mamma and sister any minute.”
0x3a5f6a5f0dcb9699d9c0f6ec8ad0a0a1dc36f38d raskolnikov made a movement and seemed about to speak; his face showed some excitement.
0x5c814f7a62917b81c41c9940a4b8ee3d8531764e pyotr petrovitch paused, waited, but as nothing followed, he went on: “... any minute.
0x76c17fb53246b684744effd3ae6635055bff7baa i have found a lodging for them on their arrival.”
0x3a11b08fb92a144483ba681709f48666ca38be34 “where?”
0x27a1991da8d7462cff2a6ead5bda099e74f42462 asked raskolnikov weakly.
0x05b30471cb7da5d4f0dd26feb79b1d925d706677 “very near here, in bakaleyev’s house.”
0x37de668d717c9c1f3d6542fc52a696dcf08ed943 “that’s in voskresensky,” put in razumihin.
0x721e28bead0e6027f1ae0a988245eee3550d0955 “there are two storeys of rooms, let by a merchant called yushin; i’ve been there.”
0x9bd29f281e3816907293bdaf620d2ad4b4c729a7 “yes, rooms...” “a disgusting place--filthy, stinking and, what’s more, of doubtful character.
0x9a0813e9885300866ef72e8994027efc7635fcd9 things have happened there, and there are all sorts of queer people living there.
0x3bafc9e682746bf5a9a1e0dc0adb08cc6c463386 and i went there about a scandalous business.
0x71f9b6b038bcd1352e688762a17e3d9f8e3a4ef5 it’s cheap, though...” “i could not, of course, find out so much about it, for i am a stranger in petersburg myself,” pyotr petrovitch replied huffily.
0x75209f44eb3206b6526fa2087fd072713b65f7a7 “however, the two rooms are exceedingly clean, and as it is for so short a time... i have already taken a permanent, that is, our future flat,” he said, addressing raskolnikov, “and i am having it done up.
0xf22f345e294e427c6352ecb8feffec38eac68d1b and meanwhile i am myself cramped for room in a lodging with my friend andrey semyonovitch lebeziatnikov, in the flat of madame lippevechsel; it was he who told me of bakaleyev’s house, too...” “lebeziatnikov?”
0x5962403f78e0bcceddd3480919d0ec7fb718d738 said raskolnikov slowly, as if recalling something.
0x317319d22abe984561ec538104c861c66af38b05 “yes, andrey semyonovitch lebeziatnikov, a clerk in the ministry.
0x0d3993073a08d63e180210e14d411b2bdc8a5e67 do you know him?”
0x1e44491ccd9e06d555e5903245d36db5f06e2f59 “yes... no,” raskolnikov answered.
0x90dbddfc02c8b8537fedbbd3fe390d831b89e3a3 “excuse me, i fancied so from your inquiry.
0xd6aa5b0bc813121f0c14ab5b717ee435e07d26b9 i was once his guardian.... a very nice young man and advanced.
0xb060bd52a8284ca58eb3dc8eb938628a951dbdd4 i like to meet young people: one learns new things from them.”
0xe88c8c4ce02df1f4fbf092b17633a57032ad41ce luzhin looked round hopefully at them all.
0xe5b38abacb56430c639fa6a6515764aa17510103 “how do you mean?”
0x56bf2c318a4e6e1df7644ee22168ca698a4de30c asked razumihin.
0xd3b179308f647d064360644e90d0d130f56f7341 “in the most serious and essential matters,” pyotr petrovitch replied, as though delighted at the question.
0xbcf9bf30958eb3252cebce57e49c1f4df9fce596 “you see, it’s ten years since i visited petersburg.
0x39423ca70cdab191e6b80a8afcf7728194d06904 all the novelties, reforms, ideas have reached us in the provinces, but to see it all more clearly one must be in petersburg.
0x2d7dce280ec70e61cdbb1a100b2792e5dde8bda8 and it’s my notion that you observe and learn most by watching the younger generation.
0x9ecda815ea7980cdafde63936b9a2f4e89959ff2 and i confess i am delighted...” “at what?”
0x404468f64285e75e5ab4a37a49cae26018a290f0 “your question is a wide one.
0x6d5fcd40ec79159a62753f6370cf29d748abb349 i may be mistaken, but i fancy i find clearer views, more, so to say, criticism, more practicality...” “that’s true,” zossimov let drop.
0xbe1e96968635af07c9f3a2224580c7e37866e8f4 “nonsense!
0xda93e6b9007de5a9cca1f368d46313700ebceb7b there’s no practicality.”
0x12d895795a92b2d2701fb5f07b5e939f237f93ba razumihin flew at him.
0xfecd85449ac5f999b572accfac2ce1da3a5e894d “practicality is a difficult thing to find; it does not drop down from heaven.
0x01a6bc0eeaf196b935f7d462bf863835073398b5 and for the last two hundred years we have been divorced from all practical life.
0xfcb058eeb35ab4e88f68418a3d8234516d0545e2 ideas, if you like, are fermenting,” he said to pyotr petrovitch, “and desire for good exists, though it’s in a childish form, and honesty you may find, although there are crowds of brigands.
0xcfe52fe63e1d97ecfbcfc51d93739fea6cd5def5 anyway, there’s no practicality.
0xfb72850f0740491e05d16719c6c52dab3a3b5a24 practicality goes well shod.”
0xae94e167eee555a28927360fed7f187f118e88ec “i don’t agree with you,” pyotr petrovitch replied, with evident enjoyment.
0x5742027951804adf2df78a29f970c84f2fca2d32 “of course, people do get carried away and make mistakes, but one must have indulgence; those mistakes are merely evidence of enthusiasm for the cause and of abnormal external environment.
0xc4cd1d792e94a15783b3aad6644914fb92f04dcb if little has been done, the time has been but short; of means i will not speak.
0xa89369e0476117900cff2dcb447c6e2cb1b54ac1 it’s my personal view, if you care to know, that something has been accomplished already.

0x995adaa0b64f2faa2f58bd97a650c61fdbd127b8 raskolnikov pronounced suddenly.
0xe289aec3e0f10cf03bf5f5877dd53b83ef42d86f “what?”
0x3592128f640f8293a46b929f89b79e51400d63c0 asked pyotr petrovitch, not catching his words; but he received no reply.
0x51bcdf56896489122533b8ce5e498dad387b6a69 “that’s all true,” zossimov hastened to interpose.
0x0e8cc1bc05dd82899a0c799cf85833fbb724073e “isn’t it so?”
0x4777e5422138c13f75e526e51a780601743f9b0d pyotr petrovitch went on, glancing affably at zossimov.
0xa4c4a1d221b8f3c3fd2084b9ffdc1e3baaf29a9f “you must admit,” he went on, addressing razumihin with a shade of triumph and superciliousness--he almost added “young man”--“that there is an advance, or, as they say now, progress in the name of science and economic truth...” “a commonplace.”
0x9eb351b1a321eef8ee18247c82abc25f62c80d4c “no, not a commonplace!
0x9da42e3f99fb5cc1cbc99a921e0f6fb1abf9db68 hitherto, for instance, if i were told, ‘love thy neighbour,’ what came of it?”
0x1faace2a548f46e80e9702c68d24c7fc1ed43ab5 pyotr petrovitch went on, perhaps with excessive haste.
0x144586bc547dbc9980490a5bb46bb29fcab60e9a “it came to my tearing my coat in half to share with my neighbour and we both were left half naked.
0x6338eeefa48e33234d9299d579cf2f32f2ce4593 as a russian proverb has it, ‘catch several hares and you won’t catch one.’
0xaa54d0761aa37087618f38863c1909fe8cbf88ad science now tells us, love yourself before all men, for everything in the world rests on self-interest.
0x2157bbff2526c68320358e856a6421df1dc88cb1 you love yourself and manage your own affairs properly and your coat remains whole.
0x410ae5a2e77cc51a0f0e98292bea34991b944326 economic truth adds that the better private affairs are organised in society--the more whole coats, so to say--the firmer are its foundations and the better is the common welfare organised too.
0xfc2cb62298d713be5f6dcaa9e1949a014ab20f3b therefore, in acquiring wealth solely and exclusively for myself, i am acquiring, so to speak, for all, and helping to bring to pass my neighbour’s getting a little more than a torn coat; and that not from private, personal liberality, but as a consequence of the general advance.
0x84091195b02e8f016eeda2ed8f51007219ad9e9a the idea is simple, but unhappily it has been a long time reaching us, being hindered by idealism and sentimentality.

0x6eac7fe5feeb6c0eb5fa6bd4ad1f0120dfc4724b i began this discussion with an object, but i’ve grown so sick during the last three years of this chattering to amuse oneself, of this incessant flow of commonplaces, always the same, that, by jove, i blush even when other people talk like that.
0x1eff9ae6d50813dc35cb9af4e095bc79c0206009 you are in a hurry, no doubt, to exhibit your acquirements; and i don’t blame you, that’s quite pardonable.
0xb46c701b7692d2015b6425daed714dae21ff2a8f i only wanted to find out what sort of man you are, for so many unscrupulous people have got hold of the progressive cause of late and have so distorted in their own interests everything they touched, that the whole cause has been dragged in the mire.
0x685b84138b86efc575b55c72af2c1c78a89f2ca1 that’s enough!”
0x8473d014bc2bf4c2be84920a77f1949d459a3007 “excuse me, sir,” said luzhin, affronted, and speaking with excessive dignity.
0x676f561f6f231fbdc54f6a2717e66369eb33abea “do you mean to suggest so unceremoniously that i too...” “oh, my dear sir... how could i?... come, that’s enough,” razumihin concluded, and he turned abruptly to zossimov to continue their previous conversation.
0x07acd8fbdcc8b49e8669bbef51e5c22cfd0d2125 pyotr petrovitch had the good sense to accept the disavowal.
0x557b52d3aa95972b6e6d724d45b46bae530165e6 he made up his mind to take leave in another minute or two.
0x3d9c67b0637882aac2eba9fa0aff5ea50cb8f96a “i trust our acquaintance,” he said, addressing raskolnikov, “may, upon your recovery and in view of the circumstances of which you are aware, become closer... above all, i hope for your return to health...” raskolnikov did not even turn his head.
0xeeee4cbaf62647513035632d31a115010e3c7c92 pyotr petrovitch began getting up from his chair.
0xabc57d225382938b37d19201787abab7863d69eb “one of her customers must have killed her,” zossimov declared positively.
0x2a7682ebc2fd4f3c214cb7d345a109c2b92ea554 “not a doubt of it,” replied razumihin.
0x853c06f43b5f284d9335aa11a9736a43e9bd1022 “porfiry doesn’t give his opinion, but is examining all who have left pledges with her there.”
0xf3bb7d680630ad70fb4dd5341fd3e693b8cb39d1 “examining them?”
0x57c551d5e91a36b0bd7dfff85ca24d4274faf195 raskolnikov asked aloud.
0x3e66b09a2263bd850e03257d7386a9307a6e9674 “yes.
0xb1f74b54e695460ba634bc7b2f0fcc1f8ec5b764 what then?”
0xe475ef4e939a0376da5bab8c4631c65fb08fdcbd “nothing.”
0x25a37b7c6ef70187b68532f46a1ae9f081f601d0 “how does he get hold of them?”
0x251fcfbde14597e0f815ac406fdcf5c5ab2b2288 asked zossimov.
0xa5d087bd79f084d98edf50382e44e38953faa576 “koch has given the names of some of them, other names are on the wrappers of the pledges and some have come forward of themselves.”
0x108aef207a90e817ce2a2baf15fc0f408c56ab30 “it must have been a cunning and practised ruffian!

0x2f096910b96259df5030a5e4a0b424d97d167e92 “that’s just what it wasn’t!”
0x1e22746fae3b9d5c6fa2331f1b6f5b56c60a0a46 interposed razumihin.
0xbd6357ae99badb6c2e00e10bbba69dbc1a49d3cb “that’s what throws you all off the scent.
0x09a963c1157c8ec1f9af8e2b06abe7278b467caf but i maintain that he is not cunning, not practised, and probably this was his first crime!
0x81ad052f3950b4838071f5d88a85fb470d4a079e the supposition that it was a calculated crime and a cunning criminal doesn’t work.
0x0ce96bc76d9de9022ec83647062a65095e5e75c4 suppose him to have been inexperienced, and it’s clear that it was only a chance that saved him--and chance may do anything.
0x4981411fad2f8da5e1188ef713650f2697568533 why, he did not foresee obstacles, perhaps!
0x8c941f860840516af0555c6e9b5940029dc29b97 and how did he set to work?
0x94e27f7d87085e160fd3d71396d0f2c751fb5686 he took jewels worth ten or twenty roubles, stuffing his pockets with them, ransacked the old woman’s trunks, her rags--and they found fifteen hundred roubles, besides notes, in a box in the top drawer of the chest!
0xc5d968570183e8752de14eace0dcd070b9b09c3f he did not know how to rob; he could only murder.
0x742491a3b01d9efd7cd1b84bf9030f222b001911 it was his first crime, i assure you, his first crime; he lost his head.
0x9989944e742fedd7893363c6a5523a52b9c59602 and he got off more by luck than good counsel!”
0x98d9ae3d2fd5a0f7e976fab65206f0626202b23d “you are talking of the murder of the old pawnbroker, i believe?”
0xff1cd846630c0c9ab39d361b712838885c4e73cc pyotr petrovitch put in, addressing zossimov.
0x5b741a5bdce82595035645c34f8c2b160b702a2f he was standing, hat and gloves in hand, but before departing he felt disposed to throw off a few more intellectual phrases.
0x37923c9b39c7295cb8054c0bd6b34ab6c5bfd773 he was evidently anxious to make a favourable impression and his vanity overcame his prudence.
0x3e66b09a2263bd850e03257d7386a9307a6e9674 “yes.
0x726e1375682404ea13955f39c21b89a60b278976 you’ve heard of it?”
0x199dda44dab4fd040304156723d50aae137d6774 “oh, yes, being in the neighbourhood.”
0x3441097fb46a605b82a86041942e1aacf930184e “do you know the details?”
0x4d801caf9e9117fccd4c65b4ce76f6388ce69b51 “i can’t say that; but another circumstance interests me in the case--the whole question, so to say.
0x70efbc70b9c825aaf917895da305fb8fc1c4d769 not to speak of the fact that crime has been greatly on the increase among the lower classes during the last five years, not to speak of the cases of robbery and arson everywhere, what strikes me as the strangest thing is that in the higher classes, too, crime is increasing proportionately.
0x475ebe94a0b627a3d724e9d45b9c17d1ac3b589c in one place one hears of a student’s robbing the mail on the high road; in another place people of good social position forge false banknotes; in moscow of late a whole gang has been captured who used to forge lottery tickets, and one of the ringleaders was a lecturer in universal history; then our secretary abroad was murdered from some obscure motive of gain.... and if this old woman, the pawnbroker, has been murdered by someone of a higher class in society--for peasants don’t pawn gold trinkets--how are we to explain this demoralisation of the civilised part of our society?”
0xa3853e0b2835b436b1de5213c7ac9a372b397c1a “there are many economic changes,” put in zossimov.
0xb71919ba567abc01f013a6357102f18782e82270 “how are we to explain it?”
0xf2819ef49f1998f4b9ff4de4760fc38554c5aff6 razumihin caught him up.
0xe781e74db0b1e52894f9fb3a14f7296409c11ea5 “it might be explained by our inveterate impracticality.”
0xe5b38abacb56430c639fa6a6515764aa17510103 “how do you mean?”
0x1105572d981b597d29eaeeba016e5363e006c3a4 “what answer had your lecturer in moscow to make to the question why he was forging notes?

0x1a0e44fac1657c8d1568e9a73e0ebcddc9c7f63f raskolnikov interposed suddenly.

0x2170641b20659fa73256d92863f463db3f4a65ab “there’s a measure in all things,” luzhin went on superciliously.
0xe623e62a504bb4694723db699b844946daf93c1c “economic ideas are not an incitement to murder, and one has but to suppose...” “and is it true,” raskolnikov interposed once more suddenly, again in a voice quivering with fury and delight in insulting him, “is it true that you told your _fiancée_... within an hour of her acceptance, that what pleased you most... was that she was a beggar... because it was better to raise a wife from poverty, so that you may have complete control over her, and reproach her with your being her benefactor?”
0xfcae99a1aff377abb124cbbc344aa88ee31eb274 “upon my word,” luzhin cried wrathfully and irritably, crimson with confusion, “to distort my words in this way!

0xe289aec3e0f10cf03bf5f5877dd53b83ef42d86f “what?”
0xe569992f63d726a50bb380d9e8690752586a6705 luzhin stood still, waiting with a defiant and offended face.

0x22de6f3a9b91b1643a8faa0fdd6f70803937a49c “so that’s how it is?”
0xf4c105fdccdac2fc5eb0705f174c420e62e7ceef luzhin turned pale and bit his lip.
0x2bfc8645850280fccf9f70723c141a3c11921db0 “let me tell you, sir,” he began deliberately, doing his utmost to restrain himself but breathing hard, “at the first moment i saw you you were ill-disposed to me, but i remained here on purpose to find out more.

0x341735b8fc6dc19d1c4882fdca57b4c572c4b9f4 but luzhin was already leaving without finishing his speech, squeezing between the table and the chair; razumihin got up this time to let him pass.
0x2d0665ddd2d8039100493c9da811a20ed50677ec without glancing at anyone, and not even nodding to zossimov, who had for some time been making signs to him to let the sick man alone, he went out, lifting his hat to the level of his shoulders to avoid crushing it as he stooped to go out of the door.
0x074c865898382da64ec3beafe576b8ced0100245 and even the curve of his spine was expressive of the horrible insult he had received.

0x95e67dde37715b22873e71c7a45a5179f113ee3a razumihin said, shaking his head in perplexity.
0xe535537b40d6b839afaed6f6e423fa63f0fcf537 “let me alone--let me alone all of you!”

0xdc97e68402c6a1baade47fe21e1f06e0d7520d75 “but we can’t leave him like this!”
0xab7bc578c82a89555508285529a9f9136160dc2e “come along,” zossimov repeated insistently, and he went out.
0x117a2061c55a164ce6be44a8b08bdd04853410ad razumihin thought a minute and ran to overtake him.
0xaf158f8e03c5d8074bfa57fa24259b2ef13c12a8 “it might be worse not to obey him,” said zossimov on the stairs.

0x6627496a7a6131b2b8768d587aff57c78378ae16 “what’s the matter with him?”

0x4fe4d4d0f9bcb3386b3b53378632eb0f76aee8b1 strange to say, he seemed immediately to have become perfectly calm; not a trace of his recent delirium nor of the panic fear that had haunted him of late.

0x0b6d2f34abec57ef105c310887769478701fa7c3 “to-day, to-day,” he muttered to himself.
0x490f7ab0a381e5b6741db336488bff00fdcaf929 he understood that he was still weak, but his intense spiritual concentration gave him strength and self-confidence.
0x4fbc5fea9d231052986a3e9d929a69c90adfbb03 he hoped, moreover, that he would not fall down in the street.
0xcdc17de1a9e0f3b1ed7ead9f252713baa1af953f when he had dressed in entirely new clothes, he looked at the money lying on the table, and after a moment’s thought put it in his pocket.
0x495078174ebc1f56cbc9c8df29537b6b2884e779 it was twenty-five roubles.
0xcb119f86698d2f150ec02ac8fa126c4804a1d02b he took also all the copper change from the ten roubles spent by razumihin on the clothes.
0x93639327d7b7704195276c43edf5b89014f11470 then he softly unlatched the door, went out, slipped downstairs and glanced in at the open kitchen door.

0x1327c6b4c008dadc641c423e0a7aebebde73ad3a it was nearly eight o’clock, the sun was setting.
0x6324cfff6f09b29f89e10e2a21d951d6d05ad2a8 it was as stifling as before, but he eagerly drank in the stinking, dusty town air.
0x58031a69dfdd88782dc1ca14f76a60b6167296c7 his head felt rather dizzy; a sort of savage energy gleamed suddenly in his feverish eyes and his wasted, pale and yellow face.
0xfdfd226c2d67443ce0a5de8cb1beb9d04942b6a4 he did not know and did not think where he was going, he had one thought only: “that all _this_ must be ended to-day, once for all, immediately; that he would not return home without it, because he _would not go on living like that_.”
0xe221e0a33e56c9a0417e2c6b28caf41b166c10f4 how, with what to make an end?
0x66dbf9b9c317bc039e2e9ac60dee17b0b91cee25 he had not an idea about it, he did not even want to think of it.
0x258be83d6aaa895114bda6782ad0f720e6a1b0a8 he drove away thought; thought tortured him.
0xc4b5f300c89fc89e2756333e70906c8b5331e48b all he knew, all he felt was that everything must be changed “one way or another,” he repeated with desperate and immovable self-confidence and determination.
0x8b466ee4d3a2642b7933baee39718f0888239660 from old habit he took his usual walk in the direction of the hay market.
0xc43604942d2c927b619f83981bff682bf694a06c a dark-haired young man with a barrel organ was standing in the road in front of a little general shop and was grinding out a very sentimental song.
0x86a7943f96be63453bd5955bab55cb7471a025ba he was accompanying a girl of fifteen, who stood on the pavement in front of him.
0x966df2b74c416d9d62ea0ef94f97aefd518cb5d6 she was dressed up in a crinoline, a mantle and a straw hat with a flame-coloured feather in it, all very old and shabby.
0x2e2adf854d4e7e1e4293e812522ca0aedd0ee215 in a strong and rather agreeable voice, cracked and coarsened by street singing, she sang in hope of getting a copper from the shop.
0xb5a32389e9e8d3f3018ee22cec613b7ee24aeecb raskolnikov joined two or three listeners, took out a five copeck piece and put it in the girl’s hand.
0x2e2f74387b54a5d220fbaf9fe75dae1fd2d2a00f she broke off abruptly on a sentimental high note, shouted sharply to the organ grinder “come on,” and both moved on to the next shop.
0xc4f595e7f6782c2d0f0f26f93ef0b5d42cfb9421 “do you like street music?”
0x9695043c32672faab8948326b159d769ef6e166e said raskolnikov, addressing a middle-aged man standing idly by him.
0x925ddc4d7a9c0e635bc667cc7e0c9c6cfa94bfde the man looked at him, startled and wondering.
0x4c4637a7bd54737ac98af42b2204616ca5cad2d4 “i love to hear singing to a street organ,” said raskolnikov, and his manner seemed strangely out of keeping with the subject--“i like it on cold, dark, damp autumn evenings--they must be damp--when all the passers-by have pale green, sickly faces, or better still when wet snow is falling straight down, when there’s no wind--you know what i mean?--and the street lamps shine through it...” “i don’t know.... excuse me...” muttered the stranger, frightened by the question and raskolnikov’s strange manner, and he crossed over to the other side of the street.
0xd81059d40fddc5092d0cf93e8d130b7e1a8151e5 raskolnikov walked straight on and came out at the corner of the hay market, where the huckster and his wife had talked with lizaveta; but they were not there now.
0x21abc54bf3fd238ad6a114709773820275febd51 recognising the place, he stopped, looked round and addressed a young fellow in a red shirt who stood gaping before a corn chandler’s shop.
0x1fb4b014fe05b1ef58e58f94a08cee4ef7f78d1b “isn’t there a man who keeps a booth with his wife at this corner?”
0x9de0c8d9bfd5b604414a14898f96380aa4626f8e “all sorts of people keep booths here,” answered the young man, glancing superciliously at raskolnikov.
0x6f8d56d63a45a72d6b0cb98be40d3593c5203761 “what’s his name?”
0x3a4862374b08061e604bd4f5fbbf2ef27d257033 “what he was christened.”
0xf6637be17892745e14d6555eec12a66b3bfabb59 “aren’t you a zaraïsky man, too?
0xcae769713ba408424414dca1e5588a66731643c8 which province?”
0xf3820441986d3b57c257f5e5a403cb58962b33c2 the young man looked at raskolnikov again.
0xf65f0292275e2a75adb6e245fd6313594236a41f “it’s not a province, your excellency, but a district.
0xe0f5a4c1a9958096d7ca28f30d025ed2ad28ff19 graciously forgive me, your excellency!”
0x7d21c1a3afd62a7711fec5a757a855897a8d4fcd “is that a tavern at the top there?”
0x1f7b093993a41ca1a44b9185681cd3b2e0403d4d “yes, it’s an eating-house and there’s a billiard-room and you’ll find princesses there too.... la-la!”
0x5684182c93f84903f9692f055a83e825dff23bfb raskolnikov crossed the square.
0x13b1b27bfe60147a74ee3da212030a7aea6df7ae in that corner there was a dense crowd of peasants.
0x6bb9ecd6876fbe2e90fe2782170932893f3e4013 he pushed his way into the thickest part of it, looking at the faces.
0x7a7ff8a2d4e4b98830e8a10d48abc60b025884cc he felt an unaccountable inclination to enter into conversation with people.
0x4eca7fd8213b62f27859abcb1ca0b2c8f0a1978c but the peasants took no notice of him; they were all shouting in groups together.
0xe3eead0beb031ed861d1b6992cdff9fb9598e00d he stood and thought a little and took a turning to the right in the direction of v. he had often crossed that little street which turns at an angle, leading from the market-place to sadovy street.
0x06261ef3aeb91ead9e57019428e6822b54ac70e5 of late he had often felt drawn to wander about this district, when he felt depressed, that he might feel more so.
0xc7c87e38cdb0ac6c83a53e95b9a9ab287af43816 now he walked along, thinking of nothing.
0x81e350f55caf9d92ead2e2b07732020aacd1fc18 at that point there is a great block of buildings, entirely let out in dram shops and eating-houses; women were continually running in and out, bare-headed and in their indoor clothes.
0xea9fd1122b97f6694335ec381f374e6d0e7d4698 here and there they gathered in groups, on the pavement, especially about the entrances to various festive establishments in the lower storeys.
0xf6c25303e80c7f0ebeaea37706e1d31a22a6f6f3 from one of these a loud din, sounds of singing, the tinkling of a guitar and shouts of merriment, floated into the street.
0x91f467e0b7b6d935284e648564deaa6f69fada75 a crowd of women were thronging round the door; some were sitting on the steps, others on the pavement, others were standing talking.
0x23028fb1c9ea0da21d25729a92c8ea6b3592252a a drunken soldier, smoking a cigarette, was walking near them in the road, swearing; he seemed to be trying to find his way somewhere, but had forgotten where.
0x746ad6e8375dc5957eeb27a542b432b0f28d1cdb one beggar was quarrelling with another, and a man dead drunk was lying right across the road.
0x5fcacf58d1ae1b77f4626d86b9de78efd9057abc raskolnikov joined the throng of women, who were talking in husky voices.
0xa897e9728ea1e2c6d7fd6a3b9e99618287293f7d they were bare-headed and wore cotton dresses and goatskin shoes.
0xc5bf202e9d2ba792d73689001a378ef1feba8c2a there were women of forty and some not more than seventeen; almost all had blackened eyes.
0x1fd6b22cc59978974d2d1b74b92b89ec95c2d95f he felt strangely attracted by the singing and all the noise and uproar in the saloon below.... someone could be heard within dancing frantically, marking time with his heels to the sounds of the guitar and of a thin falsetto voice singing a jaunty air.
0x85177a2b862c34b03d3c04fda975e9081c3aa750 he listened intently, gloomily and dreamily, bending down at the entrance and peeping inquisitively in from the pavement.
0x19faaf521cc2ba08701ccacaba41470d6f30ec42 “oh, my handsome soldier don’t beat me for nothing,” trilled the thin voice of the singer.
0x6e77032eff79a9dd8673b37861cbdfffd7a81c1d raskolnikov felt a great desire to make out what he was singing, as though everything depended on that.
0x049863adfef7b16fe8abe6cd581035b89230eb1f “shall i go in?”
0xf5eb9a7700c47f1c638e42f6143a3df6b0941693 he thought.
0xd930d92de52c3095bf2ede9cf44b50a8a8269cb9 “they are laughing.
0xe2881bcc2c4c19c43dc0667824887f6e98a807ff from drink.
0xc5ef117bcdcdb019d7d96aef46d11d61bd516612 shall i get drunk?”
0xc2ee32812d670722e58e515e459fa1a97ccbdb16 “won’t you come in?”
0xa0e6d0b145c1ce87f1ae7b4749526fb52ac729e7 one of the women asked him.
0xca27dbcf0d9f22e9901512fcf26ab6a684ea72d6 her voice was still musical and less thick than the others, she was young and not repulsive--the only one of the group.
0x2722d743e7f6d3602ee8fa372df894db46e2cd0b “why, she’s pretty,” he said, drawing himself up and looking at her.
0x9c052f9910d25016ef76553628a40108bd2747dd she smiled, much pleased at the compliment.
0x82004d80c9ddc454e9c987296b5b6ec4e1f4a66e “you’re very nice looking yourself,” she said.
0xb72859d4af2f76602acf5d81be5f1c33908f8404 “isn’t he thin though!”
0xf1b9cd4beb35becc91742d216364556291e0fd76 observed another woman in a deep bass.
0x6e11dfed6df9fb464962f3c0dff0b66f8dcb1663 “have you just come out of a hospital?”
0x861e8f138f8877170e3cb162ac3bac246abdf591 “they’re all generals’ daughters, it seems, but they have all snub noses,” interposed a tipsy peasant with a sly smile on his face, wearing a loose coat.
0xc20fe01807bf2583a9af7963c035d122a6ab82ac “see how jolly they are.”
0xef7e80270068e0caf95a2c1a45ef35f0b8361c84 “go along with you!”
0x34f6147bb12bcd1e1f2dbf81ea4ea76c8d5f1a13 “i’ll go, sweetie!”
0x06d89ee4ddeed9cead788eed3b28a0bd7ceb4603 and he darted down into the saloon below.
0xa86a69de4f179e2b4ccc56e79e1e92968816aafc raskolnikov moved on.
0xdc9f546c7d1853cb09050978c3ace93ebfcebce0 “i say, sir,” the girl shouted after him.
0xf7421ecf93fec117c5974f6568bf915fd84f7750 “what is it?”
0x9e32e01ac87b18e15c01d6548427d4ac71d8d0a7 she hesitated.
0x781a8496be40599ab227f24fdd43089b7540e649 “i’ll always be pleased to spend an hour with you, kind gentleman, but now i feel shy.
0xa515b4e7a662bffe04c2c48a471581020312a930 give me six copecks for a drink, there’s a nice young man!”
0x5340982e3fbc53a97f43a8e78da189c0236f8ef8 raskolnikov gave her what came first--fifteen copecks.
0xe1ceb11d2f638ad17807ef46f4e00a1163e32247 “ah, what a good-natured gentleman!”
0x866c2acf87f3883684edf42e5ccb46d35dc1d690 “what’s your name?”
0x744ff0155fcbb7667e349a560781032fe4f038d6 “ask for duclida.”
0xb34f27db2292f23251fe0325eb6486f6c21c1026 “well, that’s too much,” one of the women observed, shaking her head at duclida.
0x6db3f0d83dff92d6c7734935490aa8798d9fe973 “i don’t know how you can ask like that.
0xc6567f0482b9e9d48719a2041b97c5ab88caf260 i believe i should drop with shame....” raskolnikov looked curiously at the speaker.
0xb0d3229bfe2828a6a8300f8b9c1d86c4c817b0fc she was a pock-marked wench of thirty, covered with bruises, with her upper lip swollen.
0x3f256eaa487c3b9974b62bd3ee0f1c5b25aac017 she made her criticism quietly and earnestly.
0x887d3e4e3e45a6175204581bafcf321bedcae7b8 “where is it,” thought raskolnikov.
0x410544df42b17368c7751625b030b6597120f92b “where is it i’ve read that someone condemned to death says or thinks, an hour before his death, that if he had to live on some high rock, on such a narrow ledge that he’d only room to stand, and the ocean, everlasting darkness, everlasting solitude, everlasting tempest around him, if he had to remain standing on a square yard of space all his life, a thousand years, eternity, it were better to live so than to die at once!
0x10c6b8b3931687cad18d9aacebeb5c8362075977 only to live, to live and live!
0x6894635550821c03a80219bf925bad4e4019e873 life, whatever it may be!... how true it is!
0xbc7a0c9be690cb7e7a65473707e8c723b7347e26 good god, how true!
0x5f9211c21646d2e2e473873bda256fd1bfaaa366 man is a vile creature!... and vile is he who calls him vile for that,” he added a moment later.
0x15bdaba1bcd98523a0c994edea6f5e84037ef755 he went into another street.
0x59394c5c66f8b1e0a689f686007c288f8900d40e “bah, the palais de cristal!
0x6793332e043060ef3ae58e2408153d6d6d8be55a razumihin was just talking of the palais de cristal.
0xab56e6eeda1524c7e937efaa21628b1caadfdbb7 but what on earth was it i wanted?
0x153bf9861c481c27da98f54065f403c0c9fcfe02 yes, the newspapers.... zossimov said he’d read it in the papers.
0xf2f957954f9716ec688c5bc60e8db94718277b42 have you the papers?”
0x5e507e3a021ebbf28a6c54bfeceb0f006baefc9e he asked, going into a very spacious and positively clean restaurant, consisting of several rooms, which were, however, rather empty.
0xba6e98e3536c8df2ffc1fa0b21c8b8dd3645965c two or three people were drinking tea, and in a room further away were sitting four men drinking champagne.
0xe8d6e5515a11dfee3babbf122cd69437e8dd8c07 raskolnikov fancied that zametov was one of them, but he could not be sure at that distance.
0x115cb73c19a0ac7ce5ce27fa1b7b01c39a156447 “what if it is?”
0xf5eb9a7700c47f1c638e42f6143a3df6b0941693 he thought.
0x4b601f686fe4b2fd51d1866ddab59a1f4f376ca5 “will you have vodka?”
0xbe98b4d7c196e06eec90b99d4a126c9b9e64d125 asked the waiter.
0x7eb7fd7662045d4886592f016d061c7cbb3404db “give me some tea and bring me the papers, the old ones for the last five days, and i’ll give you something.”
0x96a3164ae298b22bf164274f2b6d2de8c96e8cab “yes, sir, here’s to-day’s.
0xc0726a25109ca5dd63dc22e57c0440a8ec2fc505 no vodka?”
0x6cf727db8fa7f806b679a8a43f52e0cee75cb935 the old newspapers and the tea were brought.
0xb5782b7873e8a27b0ad5d7f2f11b8965a9e47d1b raskolnikov sat down and began to look through them.
0xc0a0e3dcbc518f731ca9a29c8e6d89a1e3671d46 “oh, damn... these are the items of intelligence.
0xc170204182400b7c6ad68c91ca52644466f1ee15 an accident on a staircase, spontaneous combustion of a shopkeeper from alcohol, a fire in peski... a fire in the petersburg quarter... another fire in the petersburg quarter... and another fire in the petersburg quarter.... ah, here it is!”
0x2977eed1fc06961e0a0d2ee79c58843e2ebf833f he found at last what he was seeking and began to read it.
0x2ba9001fbe2e79bf37d6c7c61dce3e417b917d26 the lines danced before his eyes, but he read it all and began eagerly seeking later additions in the following numbers.
0xb5f8e635aa3b9843a6d9c7c0ab6a20d7982ee260 his hands shook with nervous impatience as he turned the sheets.
0x436d80215edbf9c474b56057dc71404f0f1dc1ac suddenly someone sat down beside him at his table.
0x73a250101ed0dbfad2efa2236c689f269a326ab8 he looked up, it was the head clerk zametov, looking just the same, with the rings on his fingers and the watch-chain, with the curly, black hair, parted and pomaded, with the smart waistcoat, rather shabby coat and doubtful linen.
0x34d1cdf90103a407eeb4be74cbd1574c9442d79b he was in a good humour, at least he was smiling very gaily and good-humouredly.
0x82e61e966291e66b1d107de47a4c6ffeed1c9afa his dark face was rather flushed from the champagne he had drunk.
0x580add731031c5cfc25e186322aef36d49f4de90 “what, you here?”
0xa77c55a576dd267a653959885d26ecb8d67dfcfe he began in surprise, speaking as though he’d known him all his life.
0xa2fc2115ad509619416f9fb1fdef4d51bd0bef6e “why, razumihin told me only yesterday you were unconscious.
0x84620738577f2ff4e16113a14ecf2abb0d424d26 how strange!
0x0a949dc32877cc90946c2a5ac43bdfdb23e1becb and do you know i’ve been to see you?”
0x15af8d5c88a45f334d0fcfab4310b21cded75243 raskolnikov knew he would come up to him.
0x943d04fac26d041011f55f89e2ef93d1d9d278e4 he laid aside the papers and turned to zametov.
0x702c7c08ce33b161554f5952f15ccfbee9691840 there was a smile on his lips, and a new shade of irritable impatience was apparent in that smile.
0x1c095be1347826c6b98b24458133534c43ccb97e “i know you have,” he answered.
0xe733018a4813be08666a14f08f5e97daac1bf857 “i’ve heard it.
0xddba80e7d6c8e171dd68af89b66b1d278595c3e4 you looked for my sock.... and you know razumihin has lost his heart to you?
0x70cba62800db56fa8ee984a2c25cd498e0b7349c he says you’ve been with him to luise ivanovna’s--you know, the woman you tried to befriend, for whom you winked to the explosive lieutenant and he would not understand.
0x5832f7eeaf8d0f760b48aaae552bbefe9d9e3c03 do you remember?
0xa37ffceac0e0b67acdff27482bf0f04369be817d how could he fail to understand--it was quite clear, wasn’t it?”
0xc4c14310209fa00ef1fa2aa9207c7bd7ecfe0c6e “what a hot head he is!”
0xac853ab177ee5fc6b51779e99e03e69002dff99c “the explosive one?”
0xaad3b6205cd8e51c455333e557862ff8d13aef31 “no, your friend razumihin.”
0x1ea6c1c138839f12583750e568a5bffa887113b1 “you must have a jolly life, mr. zametov; entrance free to the most agreeable places.

0x8b645095af051e6634447ff9f04d55010e055108 “we’ve just been... having a drink together.... you talk about pouring it into me!”
0x8ec8f3ceb362d6425c3ed5eb9976d3c6bd1407ec “by way of a fee!
0x87b1b5736114568a723ceaae9ca6a587fe4ba9f3 you profit by everything!”
0x9c0f2cafc1b2951114dd8a22c0ede8c8c501c25d raskolnikov laughed, “it’s all right, my dear boy,” he added, slapping zametov on the shoulder.
0xc400c9b5b0f2d88b598ee774f04a7a4c8b0cdeeb “i am not speaking from temper, but in a friendly way, for sport, as that workman of yours said when he was scuffling with dmitri, in the case of the old woman....” “how do you know about it?”
0x1e744157035464a4a7ba39f61a1f0094f739c0e0 “perhaps i know more about it than you do.”
0x6faa46db041ca84dd866e32b96c235d12644d33d “how strange you are.... i am sure you are still very unwell.
0x9d4db27dec05d08929fc709c64310a14d8b0bacc you oughtn’t to have come out.”
0x1055387ec7dc66b616a29c69b09a65a92b1eafa7 “oh, do i seem strange to you?”
0x3e66b09a2263bd850e03257d7386a9307a6e9674 “yes.
0xc4148e0b61a64d064fc4be88c9ae7c734fd6e43b what are you doing, reading the papers?”
0xa00f66ccca0a0d5e24a747fa3544a07776ae36a4 “yes.”
0xb437ea4a01481c9c3fe260839a9e35ce1bd85450 “there’s a lot about the fires.”
0x8ab799fcdfe2a24f5f2cd2867a068cfcd85e4c04 “no, i am not reading about the fires.”
0x7e91e2d8e73bd15a64061288b6b22bb12d96a77d here he looked mysteriously at zametov; his lips were twisted again in a mocking smile.
0x44bb83213dd715ee8bd381310ddb899fd0e8050e “no, i am not reading about the fires,” he went on, winking at zametov.
0x6f2b73baf7b1f10a1e20af8a8e4e2a7a5109379a “but confess now, my dear fellow, you’re awfully anxious to know what i am reading about?”
0xe57cfeba45adcda9540c74145f6a4d29940259b2 “i am not in the least.
0x759656b089ebc75df7d39fa09d94882d6d43fa47 mayn’t i ask a question?
0xf12c0d2e0b300dc55132767714ef93145bf70876 why do you keep on...?” “listen, you are a man of culture and education?”
0x060ffd85791c29146239f66590409c37b4e45979 “i was in the sixth class at the gymnasium,” said zametov with some dignity.
0xf3226c5de26a9d06c228ffd840360df928024860 “sixth class!
0x6abf8446b2588eb292a2de6d9a8fb97285ff0f43 ah, my cock-sparrow!
0xa2a60596e225215e7387231b9dd827e51e061e1d with your parting and your rings--you are a gentleman of fortune.
0x4bf3e335199107182c6f7638efaad377acc7f452 foo!
0xb064585bad567224982485c5e05fa7688f4493cd what a charming boy!”
0x185d9bccf63e03246147b2dfb7531df0318129fe here raskolnikov broke into a nervous laugh right in zametov’s face.
0xfe5828f0340fa22a9961319f7cdbf69fe8f54966 the latter drew back, more amazed than offended.
0xf1c20dfa1779e7ddf69904d77a544b6e47effa51 “foo!
0x16d529c0de7a4aa2595d84ddb891b6f8db5a53fa how strange you are!”
0x412f0bc13b32af910b866e47259164f2b0cd38c6 zametov repeated very seriously.
0x7b48e86f31730b3f74fe107402700ecd2bb4714a “i can’t help thinking you are still delirious.”
0xecdfdde9174951903b7b56c9275da5fd9b1ba0d2 “i am delirious?
0x72c0abb1f9a51b82156a35309786dbe54168f3c6 you are fibbing, my cock-sparrow!
0xdb55d9bcc15b776134c93d16d06215fdbad3828a so i am strange?
0x75c79503f966d8ca2a36473b6bcfd6ba89378284 you find me curious, do you?”
0xa2e391fb908925948f44d5b97e9fd4ecd15cd1d5 “yes, curious.”
0x3ac922d839dda8766b71e5590e576e4196dd71b2 “shall i tell you what i was reading about, what i was looking for?
0x76f750483bd9dbdbc9d0ea597573f3708dae58d2 see what a lot of papers i’ve made them bring me.
0x82e468f59736cbb0ce54459c845c25fc5fffb8c6 suspicious, eh?”
0x4a264bc0b81ef2ac2300dc44b4186616977c2251 “well, what is it?”
0xb08ad27f3d96f82ab72ea8fd5beaaf3e32c67a01 “you prick up your ears?”
0x71a202662425bad716c42eaba3fe7c5e8eef9ce3 “how do you mean--‘prick up my ears’?”
0x49ead312fdd389d1f831603b1d2567b7a7a2bc87 “i’ll explain that afterwards, but now, my boy, i declare to you... no, better ‘i confess’... no, that’s not right either; ‘i make a deposition and you take it.’
0xe88ca599ac411218337502d07ee528edb287b8dc i depose that i was reading, that i was looking and searching....” he screwed up his eyes and paused.
0x546baa9088534957314440cbe68fda80017448b8 “i was searching--and came here on purpose to do it--for news of the murder of the old pawnbroker woman,” he articulated at last, almost in a whisper, bringing his face exceedingly close to the face of zametov.
0xff2d6137a82687e3ef3c709b382a5d06d07adac7 zametov looked at him steadily, without moving or drawing his face away.
0xf071eacfd3de3a61328d9baff8a28b93d54bd9a3 what struck zametov afterwards as the strangest part of it all was that silence followed for exactly a minute, and that they gazed at one another all the while.
0x9aead779ede50241bdd09881ecc36468c8586ef7 “what if you have been reading about it?”
0x96b55569b35e03e32bddf23d4f2f0bacc0500dd5 he cried at last, perplexed and impatient.
0x57ebaecefe9e133d8446153586c17e2ff8a6742b “that’s no business of mine!
0xc0b4d36b58c3506c71428c9aa8e98613c88e18d0 what of it?”
0x205cf96d2c83f4c695e8a9aa0c6ce31a7c1674d9 “the same old woman,” raskolnikov went on in the same whisper, not heeding zametov’s explanation, “about whom you were talking in the police-office, you remember, when i fainted.
0x455a9685e2ac895a7f8aa00553e6476948a722c8 well, do you understand now?”
0x9dd1008505177c60e598e9d07c1b2026ab81333c “what do you mean?
0xb58ecadf998919470ac3aea50f9bdb8514f7e1b3 understand... what?”
0xdbfc3ef63c7b5a02eb71ea6a23563d524a9259ed zametov brought out, almost alarmed.
0x66bf12a7c2f6b41c3b04608a574c262d696f29f6 raskolnikov’s set and earnest face was suddenly transformed, and he suddenly went off into the same nervous laugh as before, as though utterly unable to restrain himself.
0x1a68a3938d3d96e362eac9a6f9d81b2ac37ecf5e and in one flash he recalled with extraordinary vividness of sensation a moment in the recent past, that moment when he stood with the axe behind the door, while the latch trembled and the men outside swore and shook it, and he had a sudden desire to shout at them, to swear at them, to put out his tongue at them, to mock them, to laugh, and laugh, and laugh!
0xfec19979c827f41e15a254262baa306f630ddfab “you are either mad, or...” began zametov, and he broke off, as though stunned by the idea that had suddenly flashed into his mind.
0x17f6b4b4fdcad1cab0375f13d478f9333a2f650b “or?
0xec020c6c2eb177c66dae70363d1c5b3bb8b555dd or what?
0x8b0be37871a605d16f7fb35e6898e847d93f03f1 what?
0xf89105e5aa4e7dba32db9d349daaaa733c0a39e1 come, tell me!”
0x3725b82b84d9db0c4e25a65899bc851d5e233dca “nothing,” said zametov, getting angry, “it’s all nonsense!”
0xf2ab078b16bf46b96a9978cdc6896b892c15e091 both were silent.
0x02fa8445cfd1bd755d02f1ba28c64978dfc6c790 after his sudden fit of laughter raskolnikov became suddenly thoughtful and melancholy.
0x30e270115473e3696c7c8a152b4d9c60c1646dda he put his elbow on the table and leaned his head on his hand.
0x82d5d87e4034e9aa995540bc32bf093679174341 he seemed to have completely forgotten zametov.
0x3f49e52ebcf37521a9edbf9bf6e20bc7133c77a8 the silence lasted for some time.
0x0d3c04145c66522f1535758032edda52ee98cb2a “why don’t you drink your tea?
0x92acf1ea8e5f103299b18550b445749c9ec3054f it’s getting cold,” said zametov.
0xe5223fdb02d9ee9ecf8a04f7116dd98e3afde8a1 “what!
0x0561a9191d2e2d8bf21b59b319607c227e6cb8b8 tea?
0x8e3d5c3add22384456afd989528f54fecd7f1794 oh, yes....” raskolnikov sipped the glass, put a morsel of bread in his mouth and, suddenly looking at zametov, seemed to remember everything and pulled himself together.
0xfb1b6a6a4e998ae2b3effcbf3d9a920975934ae0 at the same moment his face resumed its original mocking expression.
0x4b9e7520228c73e007c5d2ec7c1ae40530f3758a he went on drinking tea.
0xe6d937ded40af5b41c8dfc7fcb1a71aeb5b378f0 “there have been a great many of these crimes lately,” said zametov.
0xf22d595f83750cc672fe18b6492a1f03bc556009 “only the other day i read in the _moscow news_ that a whole gang of false coiners had been caught in moscow.
0xb6ee6ceb0b4555386f279c2f83d575868f020772 it was a regular society.
0x461676d932df3781f3f61af043c4e4d37d2d67ea they used to forge tickets!”
0x256d27c9f2ed5e8580842b994f350f1a96ba5e83 “oh, but it was a long time ago!
0x636df0dea956759892ec8abc21662ebb4df45f4e i read about it a month ago,” raskolnikov answered calmly.
0x77d22b3d548bbc8b5193368d426ae7d846d5f9da “so you consider them criminals?”
0xace6261ea5ed6642189ea059d71ece807edc244d he added, smiling.
0xb5cdbed5f44d66d1fdd7a09f362ba44aaef6347d “of course they are criminals.”
0xbbb8eee4305ceff743209b7927f97161504e5d0d “they?
0xe9f7c552fce02c7160d4baa04abb5547b498106f they are children, simpletons, not criminals!
0xc58b633577c8ec343dc2f23f330b24eb12b133bd why, half a hundred people meeting for such an object--what an idea!
0x571d84b3ee32c60f4b8903e245b25e4c2a2fbd01 three would be too many, and then they want to have more faith in one another than in themselves!
0x1177df95aa912d3155d7671082738fadd388f46c one has only to blab in his cups and it all collapses.
0x05bfe83e88d16c0b16e10a273120c12671db236d simpletons!
0xa2a25e3bc8b97dc4481fd2ba318589976da76779 they engaged untrustworthy people to change the notes--what a thing to trust to a casual stranger!
0x47c55d2c7cd11d0e729367477e21fce45436e50f well, let us suppose that these simpletons succeed and each makes a million, and what follows for the rest of their lives?
0x51ddeeccef8144fbe42718ed0094c5da9369f76f each is dependent on the others for the rest of his life!
0x787285adc36775568e66dd7643a366dcc1ea7d94 better hang oneself at once!
0x4be8c97b1ada9d37b2998b167c6aa8b723b03569 and they did not know how to change the notes either; the man who changed the notes took five thousand roubles, and his hands trembled.
0x3aa5ea1c794d8da1771a5d83b3bf4f809965c1b1 he counted the first four thousand, but did not count the fifth thousand--he was in such a hurry to get the money into his pocket and run away.
0x15247801a0d418274266f40012bc50f1a15aeae2 of course he roused suspicion.
0xbd64b08b00f9d8a06cc4fa0f9045a812969cc1f6 and the whole thing came to a crash through one fool!
0x64184f18687d584f2a40b0038d8a4a56e943c17f is it possible?”
0xa9a5627d75a459ab5b11f28aa9b657e7f0b5cb79 “that his hands trembled?”
0x1d5d012b733901a93847502fffb0c85a7e1327aa observed zametov, “yes, that’s quite possible.
0xc5c1658e57aef9be18dad31abb238b9d4fa73a63 that, i feel quite sure, is possible.
0xdbd6101a199a157b2614e681023662df3566bf23 sometimes one can’t stand things.”
0xb2e821d8de34fe6ab49e4715267812a6b406b621 “can’t stand that?”
0xbfed54c107b5294e3e92b22ddf911ca2e1fdf8e3 “why, could you stand it then?
0xc04a32c668b82fd916744d9ff23440e79764d660 no, i couldn’t.
0x0af06294eb16c3b097b5c2fe192c9e106f3a4d97 for the sake of a hundred roubles to face such a terrible experience?
0xb23dc61223a6f2f9681e4e9ceecc82e925c6d2b6 to go with false notes into a bank where it’s their business to spot that sort of thing!
0x599cae1a6393c8eedfdf258cdd9d208ce01e8913 no, i should not have the face to do it.
0x33aca82e58ab82c29a1f75abfe1e1a8ac4620cd4 would you?”
0x00b8c51544232d6d8b501784f48cb549bc8e30ea raskolnikov had an intense desire again “to put his tongue out.”
0x8121164da76e45e1ec36a4055ec11f35dcb89401 shivers kept running down his spine.
0x9698b7a87c9a62838bee91c825a7c883b0a2ead5 “i should do it quite differently,” raskolnikov began.
0xdfa1f3d92bab4fba532ea3af8c0b99ff89d194f1 “this is how i would change the notes: i’d count the first thousand three or four times backwards and forwards, looking at every note and then i’d set to the second thousand; i’d count that half-way through and then hold some fifty-rouble note to the light, then turn it, then hold it to the light again--to see whether it was a good one.
0x697dcc16f446dbbef8ca6e296dcd60d3da55e8b3 ‘i am afraid,’ i would say, ‘a relation of mine lost twenty-five roubles the other day through a false note,’ and then i’d tell them the whole story.
0x74b22928e9ba7d700f99f59a86257ed9c38d9144 and after i began counting the third, ‘no, excuse me,’ i would say, ‘i fancy i made a mistake in the seventh hundred in that second thousand, i am not sure.’
0xa68fdde024285fb1b8ced956fd57d705784df06c and so i would give up the third thousand and go back to the second and so on to the end.
0xd0639c72eeea0ca827aa8a4b08d9a94e6b0011f5 and when i had finished, i’d pick out one from the fifth and one from the second thousand and take them again to the light and ask again, ‘change them, please,’ and put the clerk into such a stew that he would not know how to get rid of me.
0x7e48517ba6542f3692d3b2ce49de7aae28e66b99 when i’d finished and had gone out, i’d come back, ‘no, excuse me,’ and ask for some explanation.
0x9756c00c2a27e617d23b494b3f8b294ffd594a7b that’s how i’d do it.”
0xf1c20dfa1779e7ddf69904d77a544b6e47effa51 “foo!
0xdad47f06cd5eefddb558dd183c213ffee505f932 what terrible things you say!”
0xfb1ed51051c9ef875b93c7541f09358c850ab7a9 said zametov, laughing.
0x0d06cd11df722c2a8d931e1927f1f4884244c9f9 “but all that is only talk.
0x7d40cf5f9bd1c503642f44d2fc73dcf728a4fdad i dare say when it came to deeds you’d make a slip.

0xb054d07489a9f2b4884ff02f685cbbadcdffadb8 the murderer seems to have been a desperate fellow, he risked everything in open daylight, was saved by a miracle--but his hands shook, too.
0x4025efe94dc23b4a81cd337303d3891a9f4b4842 he did not succeed in robbing the place, he couldn’t stand it.
0x9fde3ff68c6cb354856da1eee2c78f6c99c0231a that was clear from the...” raskolnikov seemed offended.
0x43f0f20dd503fef69c7d5b7f31e26eaa27fbb04b “clear?
0xf8ecd50d9549174106755f2c1a7d491104e8a684 why don’t you catch him then?”
0x97b8f35c1c9dd7a64f26d28c18294b462ed92dca he cried, maliciously gibing at zametov.
0x379538ddddee0c539ff836a8675996fff85d5c90 “well, they will catch him.”
0xc3902b6493b47b4cbb33d03d3da0adea6fa653ad “who?
0xa8ed45c81c3a71642c10d6cec1983f086206a5e6 you?
0x3495242f159cf0aa3c112fde24ffee2eef208490 do you suppose you could catch him?
0x37c482b8070dc93f5a135d91fd59239ba649b93c you’ve a tough job!
0x2087ddb8d1d8f1a91e464c4b0e335ea0f65973b0 a great point for you is whether a man is spending money or not.
0x8a9af545b259e389edc0a5b9af394e7bf7adc00e if he had no money and suddenly begins spending, he must be the man.
0x94affa4f47757e64ffaabed83a019ff069fb52de so that any child can mislead you.”
0xfd2625df683894521ecf1bf2f2ad18d0f0bdf9b7 “the fact is they always do that, though,” answered zametov.
0xfb20faea5c56d96f5664a7b745e55f3cdccff184 “a man will commit a clever murder at the risk of his life and then at once he goes drinking in a tavern.
0x56729bc163d247c3723d44fbf5dc7c968b43539f they are caught spending money, they are not all as cunning as you are.
0xad6275fddf4ff007a42bedcf6f2b8edab25b706a you wouldn’t go to a tavern, of course?”
0x97fe8821142be23267fba543ad11632d6f07b820 raskolnikov frowned and looked steadily at zametov.
0x8f2fa482f2b85af482b293c34c7433b8e500c6a7 “you seem to enjoy the subject and would like to know how i should behave in that case, too?”
0xbbccdd1cd589eed00995c429255403bddc64928d he asked with displeasure.
0x32ce1117c536338ed7d965ef9b762ee1df3738d5 “i should like to,” zametov answered firmly and seriously.
0x3e590fcbc2bd4ea1b8e6af1cf06477ae16366111 somewhat too much earnestness began to appear in his words and looks.
0x7b10bd01f322226e213ef35dc8e20508a8cefc33 “very much?”
0x5c886a985cc0003eb27917689df0b1e2f747b7ef “very much!”
0x0cd06a4b9717fe94ba7c6892129334af278872ba “all right then.
0xd86b3d35013c94ec88e87d0b7ec4ef87f6536276 this is how i should behave,” raskolnikov began, again bringing his face close to zametov’s, again staring at him and speaking in a whisper, so that the latter positively shuddered.
0x285f0d9dbd60695561967319215a6f0bfb203a42 “this is what i should have done.
0xff6f4180c3a21dcec29fac5114029af6991c95e0 i should have taken the money and jewels, i should have walked out of there and have gone straight to some deserted place with fences round it and scarcely anyone to be seen, some kitchen garden or place of that sort.
0xb8f2db0feadb158171188b5df026b4d9e0367d7a i should have looked out beforehand some stone weighing a hundredweight or more which had been lying in the corner from the time the house was built.
0xd8269708eb9e635901980a21f0434ee91a58bc50 i would lift that stone--there would sure to be a hollow under it, and i would put the jewels and money in that hole.
0xeedeeff811a1eafe5a02262365172eb86a3b94ee then i’d roll the stone back so that it would look as before, would press it down with my foot and walk away.
0x970559e068fa1b98266ba25ae4a0bfeffecbd6e9 and for a year or two, three maybe, i would not touch it.
0xec34b159d36866e47d50766f1a83ac97ebefb964 and, well, they could search!
0x5c9816dcce319dad0deb7e5f3e36f336fdaaf88c there’d be no trace.”
0xb01bc923212c10f5652233dd10c2578a0e8d9f1a “you are a madman,” said zametov, and for some reason he too spoke in a whisper, and moved away from raskolnikov, whose eyes were glittering.
0x5374972c855911186a5a4dcd74eca629947d9613 he had turned fearfully pale and his upper lip was twitching and quivering.
0xd3b2edc7e61d45e7ccf66ef0fae43154ef21319b he bent down as close as possible to zametov, and his lips began to move without uttering a word.
0x24a9e09ba3f669384d2d94d1e4c4f8ab6ce44f81 this lasted for half a minute; he knew what he was doing, but could not restrain himself.
0xec86664ee75b8f236a94700bda1e34a42d66f47c the terrible word trembled on his lips, like the latch on that door; in another moment it will break out, in another moment he will let it go, he will speak out.
0xb57550aea3f440158cacb2cea3347f11278efe8b “and what if it was i who murdered the old woman and lizaveta?”
0x2733b26fe1817fa9a427ea1902912f5a8aa4dcd1 he said suddenly and--realised what he had done.
0x514f5a9137de91d3f03800adc8513b115686e4ca zametov looked wildly at him and turned white as the tablecloth.
0x5844e43ee1b030b38c69b82854165151a4a15588 his face wore a contorted smile.
0xc8647ab364b5af06e173cb92e768c97fcd26b706 “but is it possible?”
0xd1d1beb4283ac1b93812e486202cb9ad12daa7fa he brought out faintly.
0x2d7a6fb171ebf389bd7fe94549edc3edbf04faec raskolnikov looked wrathfully at him.
0x532fc409959e8e87accec2290301de4ce2936927 “own up that you believed it, yes, you did?”
0xb493e2946fee956111ec0b8535a0eed269e0377d “not a bit of it, i believe it less than ever now,” zametov cried hastily.
0xb9dba44e1df0264085437832eda3b97624fcaf0a “i’ve caught my cock-sparrow!
0xbce5b6464fdf2c711bd3075b188fc5145714e4d2 so you did believe it before, if now you believe less than ever?”
0xdec3a6771ae68a343a0c7e92b46b7114c4f16b7d “not at all,” cried zametov, obviously embarrassed.
0xcd43e168939214ce1123f8c45b27bf954bc643a8 “have you been frightening me so as to lead up to this?”
0xa46092e90753d78872fda603284a947722d81632 “you don’t believe it then?
0x535aa7daac4858c5a5ebf52c45be10ef47a31227 what were you talking about behind my back when i went out of the police-office?
0xd0a1e51835e25f5aa78c3e30143af92ea880af1e and why did the explosive lieutenant question me after i fainted?
0x9fd61bf65f5094017f6eeae6e70587629d542593 hey, there,” he shouted to the waiter, getting up and taking his cap, “how much?”
0x5ec7fb6300cfa2eea8dad77caf2c2a1e7a32d098 “thirty copecks,” the latter replied, running up.
0xdf468c65b23d37ceeef058d6fbf078387792ca3c “and there is twenty copecks for vodka.
0x2ab8887b67344664eafc17850fed6533aaa2fad5 see what a lot of money!”
0xcd1d9c889a5b63c8bc97a497b377e816db591326 he held out his shaking hand to zametov with notes in it.
0x51d3b7f755df8b4b2199598f459b314390a536d2 “red notes and blue, twenty-five roubles.
0xc1328293a5c6bf2c13f186d36fe849e7a49efeeb where did i get them?
0xfbe5343463d91509c4792cc96276fe181cff0a1f and where did my new clothes come from?
0xf2a07674cdd7ac4ca13d13fbc59f56b357df88a8 you know i had not a copeck.
0x4b8043b531ab8405713df228a028883b6c688c75 you’ve cross-examined my landlady, i’ll be bound.... well, that’s enough!
0xce8c157df19f7b15dc458606edc99b2c632cc184 _assez causé!_ till we meet again!”
0xddf33a5ccc5eeb094998132817de1cca0c1ef3f2 he went out, trembling all over from a sort of wild hysterical sensation, in which there was an element of insufferable rapture.
0xd768c9d331f5aeab537e538ee6e1fde26ade3067 yet he was gloomy and terribly tired.
0xdcb2c933f06721866a4163ffa2b57fabb0a84140 his face was twisted as after a fit.
0xa692c7b7543f9dbbd3da8a205e67ed2ef9935efb his fatigue increased rapidly.
0xc082a403fe428448c4f58819269565f8e9cd692a any shock, any irritating sensation stimulated and revived his energies at once, but his strength failed as quickly when the stimulus was removed.
0xf91704e8f51da2bf8365accbfdbdefbff944ea7b zametov, left alone, sat for a long time in the same place, plunged in thought.
0xb9ae795ac41cef358b3f01a27210cd9a7bb1bb59 raskolnikov had unwittingly worked a revolution in his brain on a certain point and had made up his mind for him conclusively.
0x7c5058bf47aa6a6419b8d69432610a9a0d274415 “ilya petrovitch is a blockhead,” he decided.
0x2f79c8b029216e908aaa9d09bd17a86d09498310 raskolnikov had hardly opened the door of the restaurant when he stumbled against razumihin on the steps.
0xfb2e8409183bfe56e4dbc38fca27e8c9c9b303cc they did not see each other till they almost knocked against each other.
0xae8431e598fad8def90feaff8e77757565f3eba2 for a moment they stood looking each other up and down.
0x00429a1a1a69cd8df88bb9555d7ec3869bf958d2 razumihin was greatly astounded, then anger, real anger gleamed fiercely in his eyes.
0x0d1c2aa2b10edbe075cd073e889af7e63017ce37 “so here you are!”
0x5f456c3ca92f9b9d051d36673f37e0e0ec44a27e he shouted at the top of his voice--“you ran away from your bed!
0x77fc1f9f89e6b41b0c21998f9a56a5149f50b4ca and here i’ve been looking for you under the sofa!
0x689430e50a826fd588f35b9b74adc0cd2fb9fd2f we went up to the garret.
0x2705edb87162c2e9e5908d0fafcfdf2d0d53f03e i almost beat nastasya on your account.
0x030e2261f0788cb49f6e62d70370cebcfc2fa01b and here he is after all.
0xd03274eaf2cdd0f85884e81854a40f6f667148b0 rodya!
0x5c5bfbb5a698a25bd45528749788e0386b82cc1b what is the meaning of it?
0x93f7f959b23676f14f23071c14addd0e6ddb4036 tell me the whole truth!
0x353bb002f2ce07bc97fb4009cfbada0e77d7ca7a confess!
0xf32b511ebea017eca9455604ba63026d60ed9d5e do you hear?”
0x77fc9240491cd803e201ff4df3993c398299819a “it means that i’m sick to death of you all and i want to be alone,” raskolnikov answered calmly.
0x0d73b2d7d49ae5ed80a2ed3a895d1c90c4ebdb42 “alone?
0x150f24f3198792bd854f3259114866d4092ddcc4 when you are not able to walk, when your face is as white as a sheet and you are gasping for breath!

0x4138e470efd84d38df9174170c2a7f216260fd75 own up at once!”
0x9d61bd87acf785ec6cc6b5555691b529adff76b7 “let me go!”
0x97b99faa8d5f142e8e450c87e3fa3c0ec6f01908 said raskolnikov and tried to pass him.
0x37b4e5645b62c4aec2ef138345f0197751e6b9de this was too much for razumihin; he gripped him firmly by the shoulder.
0x2dec81692004bec64246ffee8b3a2196eca67c2d “let you go?
0xe6f3009c02d774c550dec3a57afc4623d49f18f8 you dare tell me to let you go?
0x88dfc9858c3012067114444211619c6615a6bf08 do you know what i’ll do with you directly?
0x1c2ce8e6b96d04346301e627e969346eac965a12 i’ll pick you up, tie you up in a bundle, carry you home under my arm and lock you up!”
0xc50e055a62fe37157ba3b19bdb5b9e66546ac448 “listen, razumihin,” raskolnikov began quietly, apparently calm--“can’t you see that i don’t want your benevolence?
0xc0a53fbeb5405c6e8d7af9cb839caa82bc760b53 a strange desire you have to shower benefits on a man who... curses them, who feels them a burden in fact!
0x748b6cb9ca0aa73d69d5f928a6818b42e4cf1b0f why did you seek me out at the beginning of my illness?
0xf7cbc7c16023dc6e7c29f0f81a27720898339840 maybe i was very glad to die.
0xbe63f2b870be956f03099428da76c4cc8904a336 didn’t i tell you plainly enough to-day that you were torturing me, that i was... sick of you!
0xf2b091291d82889937ecb67d163417f94d0b660d you seem to want to torture people!
0xb58b9106653c81e5fd0ce2ea8b117412d8767359 i assure you that all that is seriously hindering my recovery, because it’s continually irritating me.
0x836174c5e60da97b69ef6991458f22bcd0abed7c you saw zossimov went away just now to avoid irritating me.
0x4ba121f0fa733c1d89612407459e873253193428 you leave me alone too, for goodness’ sake!
0x95fcb906007660d082acc168549cb7dbf7bb7c14 what right have you, indeed, to keep me by force?
0x95b657e643ee4bf63dd940e54f453fb815698052 don’t you see that i am in possession of all my faculties now?
0xaefe4c1471483ef065ad904e3faae8c1571b5b6d how, how can i persuade you not to persecute me with your kindness?
0x4adda12654d8bee29cadfbe6c17d87b269c6437f i may be ungrateful, i may be mean, only let me be, for god’s sake, let me be!
0xcb1098721b9c21491447eb49600165aefa017086 let me be, let me be!”
0x0023a347fa02981732a0fbde5f59eb554f988902 he began calmly, gloating beforehand over the venomous phrases he was about to utter, but finished, panting for breath, in a frenzy, as he had been with luzhin.
0x87d7c58f0e65dad7969db363d37c41b30d144d94 razumihin stood a moment, thought and let his hand drop.
0x3fc949a388e38a173c92d3076f50166598d8aed1 “well, go to hell then,” he said gently and thoughtfully.
0x70ff673ecf66d5fcd29074367a148003754de326 “stay,” he roared, as raskolnikov was about to move.
0x6492b97bdfacf973c7ad296a1d125c8ff72ed919 “listen to me.

0x2640db154a6b6f8aaad46efb5563c081d2aead8e he cried with redoubled fury, noticing that raskolnikov was again making a movement--“hear me out!
0x31510c3c882e0f4f40dc30831b781e6caffb3f28 you know i’m having a house-warming this evening, i dare say they’ve arrived by now, but i left my uncle there--i just ran in--to receive the guests.
0xe40542c21bc3e29a11b9232da588fe3001c3e0b8 and if you weren’t a fool, a common fool, a perfect fool, if you were an original instead of a translation... you see, rodya, i recognise you’re a clever fellow, but you’re a fool!--and if you weren’t a fool you’d come round to me this evening instead of wearing out your boots in the street!
0xe2d85afa541f8532ad29d53ce5c77458611bf36a since you have gone out, there’s no help for it!
0xb81d3d075ba06d5b86b1e95a4f776d5e92c94203 i’d give you a snug easy chair, my landlady has one... a cup of tea, company.... or you could lie on the sofa--any way you would be with us.... zossimov will be there too.
0x105fbc8ed1face3adef4d683386f94d8ca6e4b6a will you come?”
0x13f596b2318a7d846472d7d1c89afeda0d42126a “no.”

0xede35ecdcc057058dd7b06fab50ee2fec675fd7f razumihin shouted, out of patience.

0xaf8878330b54df1e21a3e1361fd5379559d3e847 raskolnikov turned and walked away.
0x3479ea69b61134bc4556c662eb7c2a483fe0937d “i bet you will,” razumihin shouted after him.
0x1b8053d9bdecd1175ef7300775364d6c3d390294 “i refuse to know you if you don’t!

0x16381111324f9ed7b0b02355ebc8557e5e8c0883 raskolnikov walked on and turned the corner into sadovy street.
0xd93ca1eeab3242889384a875bde90c39ed40d52b razumihin looked after him thoughtfully.
0x6b3066817992fec35daa1ef4f9de3a381072b610 then with a wave of his hand he went into the house but stopped short of the stairs.
0x6c3e37144472182304877c353db1082280263abb “confound it,” he went on almost aloud.

0x37b878b713ea6e1179c3d56a0bc91e1e5a628130 he struck his finger on his forehead.

0xf1c27031deb6399a1bed59ae739b3137674b3009 and he ran back to overtake raskolnikov, but there was no trace of him.
0x63e6a6f242dcfdbe4dbb3d5fa63d23ab47404cc3 with a curse he returned with rapid steps to the palais de cristal to question zametov.
0x98432f7c1dfd2c5610c58ef81c9aa1980af4d317 raskolnikov walked straight to x---- bridge, stood in the middle, and leaning both elbows on the rail stared into the distance.
0xb9818d0adab00c6bf871d8d8b666e6128fa9b84d on parting with razumihin, he felt so much weaker that he could scarcely reach this place.
0xe09b88515e086dd87b5848cb4316cba8f28150a7 he longed to sit or lie down somewhere in the street.
0x1fb9cfbf48b3d4dacf23fbb7dd6a82d45b8fa3e9 bending over the water, he gazed mechanically at the last pink flush of the sunset, at the row of houses growing dark in the gathering twilight, at one distant attic window on the left bank, flashing as though on fire in the last rays of the setting sun, at the darkening water of the canal, and the water seemed to catch his attention.
0xec07ad7ab93f9b4aa80fba26011aae47a61a2e1e at last red circles flashed before his eyes, the houses seemed moving, the passers-by, the canal banks, the carriages, all danced before his eyes.
0x036c5d54256636333ffccd7f56dacee2d346346a suddenly he started, saved again perhaps from swooning by an uncanny and hideous sight.
0xe422a6785023ed34f9cc21be21d4e10baa4004d4 he became aware of someone standing on the right side of him; he looked and saw a tall woman with a kerchief on her head, with a long, yellow, wasted face and red sunken eyes.
0x965c165fcf85d5597a04d4997db29359065db41b she was looking straight at him, but obviously she saw nothing and recognised no one.
0xb630f2c14b5ab4b14a5ca2fa8186d38de4e333dc suddenly she leaned her right hand on the parapet, lifted her right leg over the railing, then her left and threw herself into the canal.
0x7f52f5f6bcd167ff6134308be4ec74267d0b7d69 the filthy water parted and swallowed up its victim for a moment, but an instant later the drowning woman floated to the surface, moving slowly with the current, her head and legs in the water, her skirt inflated like a balloon over her back.
0x0abdbb2619fd9eff3b6c5f2d5d2b9e747cb4500d “a woman drowning!
0x16042099c3ae38d2553559b1b9a8074b3521865f a woman drowning!”
0xd5d626d5ccb4b0a668c797830fdb49aa3083d1d8 shouted dozens of voices; people ran up, both banks were thronged with spectators, on the bridge people crowded about raskolnikov, pressing up behind him.
0x6cf8b83ca28569e72caa34df9ba46374b6f1a4c7 “mercy on it!
0xab578cc55dfeeab612c3ab536cf3a72314e1cc8d it’s our afrosinya!”
0x1a6f1495086ce6d166da28922d2dfb0a9c03d39d a woman cried tearfully close by.
0xc15f93ba94aff93986b9fe33688b9d40cc21fd1a “mercy!
0x5b9894724d7250cb39e0f1858694d87ed687a893 save her!
0x35f9ea547ae7f0d5fb2d70063b4f157d2ca846ad kind people, pull her out!”
0xf2c17b87705789ae1051261ec45fa2ecd46a4438 “a boat, a boat” was shouted in the crowd.
0xb3043585f5badacd23869f87b3f1d9aa2b069848 but there was no need of a boat; a policeman ran down the steps to the canal, threw off his great coat and his boots and rushed into the water.
0x4ebf005498cd1466fb93b54c0301e2bc0e74e729 it was easy to reach her: she floated within a couple of yards from the steps, he caught hold of her clothes with his right hand and with his left seized a pole which a comrade held out to him; the drowning woman was pulled out at once.
0x81788fa987a0547d00df529bdc8d8b333bb0a58e they laid her on the granite pavement of the embankment.
0x7e12e6bf3ac9deb56ea1d19aaf491954e3ba469e she soon recovered consciousness, raised her head, sat up and began sneezing and coughing, stupidly wiping her wet dress with her hands.
0x5142863fc40d4c30d862159b29823f7a0daac869 she said nothing.
0x9c354d92e4314ad9cb3b1e289596c3812b616bb4 “she’s drunk herself out of her senses,” the same woman’s voice wailed at her side.
0xa83b557c17f03e573c017f4d99e71cf4c4ef0e2f “out of her senses.
0xa6112091ed1f586f87c7bba77fe32282e70b264f the other day she tried to hang herself, we cut her down.
0xa3e9b147d2537d576ab36003ea708b214d0ea780 i ran out to the shop just now, left my little girl to look after her--and here she’s in trouble again!
0x06e1d3badb1e822dadd7f5d28b6097be8b51afe4 a neighbour, gentleman, a neighbour, we live close by, the second house from the end, see yonder....” the crowd broke up.
0xeeba7ce299bd90c83820c8de07f2f63750f3594a the police still remained round the woman, someone mentioned the police station.... raskolnikov looked on with a strange sensation of indifference and apathy.
0xcf60354a192b234d1571e33dc40c47144239fdb7 he felt disgusted.
0x0b57965634fee0ab4b4c1749a7f9328ac2fa5174 “no, that’s loathsome... water... it’s not good enough,” he muttered to himself.
0x6d8c79c6e8048a929cf163f14e1ddbf2fd713b12 “nothing will come of it,” he added, “no use to wait.
0x753c5ac02673846a8a35d8fc7b5d94ba146bc969 what about the police office...? and why isn’t zametov at the police office?
0x3ec1d27320b429b547ae52bb94026fbf45d1f02a the police office is open till ten o’clock....” he turned his back to the railing and looked about him.
0x33badec716e3560f2614b64cc4334b36548f4cc6 “very well then!”
0xa2005803c521cf169e1a188968842685d05b51d8 he said resolutely; he moved from the bridge and walked in the direction of the police office.
0x33fe1fe31490ac1a33e34b7ef1b47438a3a9a4ce his heart felt hollow and empty.
0xd4481946855f457e1f6b9f23f8f0dd0fdcc11f12 he did not want to think.
0x459cdc55b6925a1db0605f396b182c917f52a16d even his depression had passed, there was not a trace now of the energy with which he had set out “to make an end of it all.”
0x5ab1c57986f9f445b4364009af9e68789beee96f complete apathy had succeeded to it.
0x82b5ea296a0fb11d199392ea364298b94f639b15 “well, it’s a way out of it,” he thought, walking slowly and listlessly along the canal bank.
0x5d3f5eed27c570101444d9f633a0c1327c0f030f “anyway i’ll make an end, for i want to.... but is it a way out?
0xbf4a354b0e341e74c9321a6f084d323dce765db8 what does it matter!
0x786efe3bea3160b698ab3113c533ac01ce3a7846 there’ll be the square yard of space--ha!
0x8e351cabb46a35733b621a60514ed1a26a941945 but what an end!
0x3d68e108eef625dd6ab4cf6a230ab1a63ef3867e is it really the end?
0x858f29472b248d019d7bf740b0cfdcdefe7fa160 shall i tell them or not?
0xdbc8660d1c0c7fe5dcb13b5cbfb8512bf3c2cd65 ah... damn!
0xb1f0a8f0a5ba2670e7934e282f8b2f7ac0724f65 how tired i am!
0xf10f2cb479849fbe7b3255167083652453b6df89 if i could find somewhere to sit or lie down soon!
0x8d2f3ed4e4d80aa1952a6e596a55cbb3daf80e8c what i am most ashamed of is its being so stupid.
0x5adb879a52a205ed4588139d052521342d9e2199 but i don’t care about that either!
0x925452fca3bc4f43b192f2589ea6d1830ecb9290 what idiotic ideas come into one’s head.”
0x30de166d53df7f86f24fffdd3778902366465c11 to reach the police office he had to go straight forward and take the second turning to the left.
0x83a26da71a3cc4a0ca08090375b8cd5bd63539a5 it was only a few paces away.
0xb42c54d44b2cc883c9fed523e4a4db9b6633f638 but at the first turning he stopped and, after a minute’s thought, turned into a side street and went two streets out of his way, possibly without any object, or possibly to delay a minute and gain time.
0xa95f44f361176c793d202ec83c651f98aa9ffd74 he walked, looking at the ground; suddenly someone seemed to whisper in his ear; he lifted his head and saw that he was standing at the very gate of _the_ house.
0xf2e655571857993278d6c2887a34fb8113222959 he had not passed it, he had not been near it since _that_ evening.
0x3e0a76b88d42d5fb803bd2e6b7ad1ebb16366382 an overwhelming, unaccountable prompting drew him on.
0xf93a234980d5b046712d78fd8afa1eb486b1ea94 he went into the house, passed through the gateway, then into the first entrance on the right, and began mounting the familiar staircase to the fourth storey.
0xa8f529ea3c23d98f08eabd91964e694d3d9965b5 the narrow, steep staircase was very dark.
0x85c5782b1d17ca412f380bcc85689f6ec161e951 he stopped at each landing and looked round him with curiosity; on the first landing the framework of the window had been taken out.
0x23ebd4b4203ba3b6a41f390018dc43ea57d68f65 “that wasn’t so then,” he thought.
0x6fbb3e1b38b5d0c40134476c8954333d89c3c4c4 here was the flat on the second storey where nikolay and dmitri had been working.
0x6ca0a598726f46b9452bd3195c20f19684367f82 “it’s shut up and the door newly painted.
0xadb6596dfae56cb86af8db0178228b61124b2982 so it’s to let.”
0x27d13af54eaa86dd4df74da031ea2ff0fb360e6a then the third storey and the fourth.
0x57321c27b32a6469ddc1c30853fde8ee5f74c82a “here!”
0x68b6b57ba972bfe24c22d03d001a083b0f54da34 he was perplexed to find the door of the flat wide open.
0xec1551254f74be5f58107bea20ccfc39edf295a0 there were men there, he could hear voices; he had not expected that.
0x4e77f0b31926bd935b8ebb571f7ff2233df9df37 after brief hesitation he mounted the last stairs and went into the flat.
0x5301fc91f604e4ee4741fdd88f875c79b3a9cb0e it, too, was being done up; there were workmen in it.
0x574ad62de7a16568a1392478e6dd59143b07c121 this seemed to amaze him; he somehow fancied that he would find everything as he left it, even perhaps the corpses in the same places on the floor.
0xc5d82a300a1058eb0a06e669d95601841c2fc9ad and now, bare walls, no furniture; it seemed strange.
0x3b76eeac01ba5fb1470c748d69d7ee48c37211dc he walked to the window and sat down on the window-sill.
0xbd084e0565375afcdf60881b3674117c83014dfc there were two workmen, both young fellows, but one much younger than the other.
0x8ba5a60b08ad8bd38c9184955a97dfe95652b474 they were papering the walls with a new white paper covered with lilac flowers, instead of the old, dirty, yellow one.
0x6fb07f3c2e504e962f568e3dae424edc9d1df76a raskolnikov for some reason felt horribly annoyed by this.
0xa15371f309367f28e2579853bea9fcb2eca9f460 he looked at the new paper with dislike, as though he felt sorry to have it all so changed.
0xc8d9116684d9b9ef703b85302f321d48bf274ce0 the workmen had obviously stayed beyond their time and now they were hurriedly rolling up their paper and getting ready to go home.
0x2062aeda2f226d5038f1aab029fc9eee4364fc0d they took no notice of raskolnikov’s coming in; they were talking.
0xfe24859f60b22502f486559a0ee07113df651029 raskolnikov folded his arms and listened.
0xd978c924df7bd0be12b3624a575300283f7db23b “she comes to me in the morning,” said the elder to the younger, “very early, all dressed up.
0xd61175b5e315db55f5816ec400659c739788048a ‘why are you preening and prinking?’
0xbc32debf5b964c313a9a92d77e8f6c944dbfbef2 says i.
0x6b77366652725c0f0bd42ad6b837fe114059528e ‘i am ready to do anything to please you, tit vassilitch!’
0xfeb96e6fc09c372f156205d7f7203953cf4f7d38 that’s a way of going on!
0xf61646119f17e0fbb8dd308a40ccfe63e783b7a4 and she dressed up like a regular fashion book!”
0xce04bef330b1c9358ab17f33edeb805d48615935 “and what is a fashion book?”
0x11ae4e7b708373b69c8cc33df1f0b9091af863e8 the younger one asked.
0x8a531af8418613465884781bf1ed0f6218e0b2f5 he obviously regarded the other as an authority.
0x51b7a235ee2ba749cd441efe0063029e148ae8fd “a fashion book is a lot of pictures, coloured, and they come to the tailors here every saturday, by post from abroad, to show folks how to dress, the male sex as well as the female.
0x34fda8f21d1cd0d98211e96732577e1d80f636bd they’re pictures.
0x7efad6966faa1389fadcbc5c3872eebaa34b732c the gentlemen are generally wearing fur coats and for the ladies’ fluffles, they’re beyond anything you can fancy.”
0x36d6b0ab99ce8b565ad10d6e5cb4f3ef7594044d “there’s nothing you can’t find in petersburg,” the younger cried enthusiastically, “except father and mother, there’s everything!”
0xec31b6b4a5f6d2c074613cf06c2f573a14016b64 “except them, there’s everything to be found, my boy,” the elder declared sententiously.
0x918cc1819358def4e24801033415bb3ef5aaccd9 raskolnikov got up and walked into the other room where the strong box, the bed, and the chest of drawers had been; the room seemed to him very tiny without furniture in it.
0x395d40261418c4820bc6a060051e34db8335d942 the paper was the same; the paper in the corner showed where the case of ikons had stood.
0xc4e2e6bd0e25ae520d8c72357cb97daecce21b27 he looked at it and went to the window.
0x80b97c58511d63c278bffa99f8189eba4f540048 the elder workman looked at him askance.
0x721ede191520c07dca21bffcf2c4a846f673e300 “what do you want?”
0x268b1c58e544f669e6d7289969fec55677d45fff he asked suddenly.
0x4046a0af31af2c92468e12f571cbe3873c2efed1 instead of answering raskolnikov went into the passage and pulled the bell.
0x0398b6dfb6e8d4aa4021a1f5a063c67ccd66b076 the same bell, the same cracked note.
0xcae90729b52ca364dd47f795f8d3c0ab5cbf9042 he rang it a second and a third time; he listened and remembered.
0xc766f7f44c68e8f432dca5832da759614e263120 the hideous and agonisingly fearful sensation he had felt then began to come back more and more vividly.
0xe27181d9b0a4239d09852785fc5cdf2b7517fbef he shuddered at every ring and it gave him more and more satisfaction.
0xbd5820b2f3b03aa911529a478c4d2658fe012d71 “well, what do you want?
0x52dd2ea6b29649a2ae538e8b1b0d215538e66e82 who are you?”
0x8b39a2c8d506782939d21e4ca16bded35b789e6f the workman shouted, going out to him.
0x1291feaf666517dcbec017a556dce357fe14bcd1 raskolnikov went inside again.
0x9432553bd955fec21225f5c5b4dab573344052e2 “i want to take a flat,” he said.
0x90138b2ec0487b380b3872c261fce5573321fcc3 “i am looking round.”
0x16e9816bce5f543dca744da1b0473da4760069b9 “it’s not the time to look at rooms at night!
0xcba52e0056e45502b8b58cbdda599c745b57e2a5 and you ought to come up with the porter.”
0x4ea33f61fd34da21ddfe006ecfafa048381db9cd “the floors have been washed, will they be painted?”
0xae01ee8efe9f13d64e01994ebdc4d43902f66d38 raskolnikov went on.
0xc585f165b7229a6b314c51a24e1dab61a7340353 “is there no blood?”
0xd0e623da58fbb92068c67f7268aae671ecc20124 “what blood?”
0x5926e96caf9bba7066175d10863256f5e52a5a88 “why, the old woman and her sister were murdered here.
0x6d5252e33f29eba00668ac6d85e4c5f0d6728511 there was a perfect pool there.”
0x29d61e8862933af4d9729409c3dade2f476c79bf “but who are you?”
0x02c3f7a0736a23d73e3599216ced014c7503fecc the workman cried, uneasy.
0x0ddc2dd9cb87dfaa7062259f5053ac17322a7a1d “who am i?”
0xa00f66ccca0a0d5e24a747fa3544a07776ae36a4 “yes.”
0x9ac5b6a99e51bcb5a4d1466079e757518c446ad7 “you want to know?
0x4b0c75a68e5428cae9513b0c7e4502bca4b64208 come to the police station, i’ll tell you.”
0x8eb4961e7b05e01200927c3763c0e2b5f384bfe5 the workmen looked at him in amazement.
0xfffe1eaa6c441349de82c3caa9c4c2c6a5e87b00 “it’s time for us to go, we are late.
0x663c25ba8533ce96384bb4bb3ad91bf9d570938f come along, alyoshka.
0xa656e85bc62f2798189da944e1b16704e94fd435 we must lock up,” said the elder workman.
0x2d32903ec5abacc94f7b7325beff589bbbdd78ca “very well, come along,” said raskolnikov indifferently, and going out first, he went slowly downstairs.
0x8ad73df3eea21bf32c7bd659131f68d08b71ba36 “hey, porter,” he cried in the gateway.
0x3072da3734e7fe52311725f16ff527b4f4b1531c at the entrance several people were standing, staring at the passers-by; the two porters, a peasant woman, a man in a long coat and a few others.
0x16078cd6f3ed1cfc565ae404f3756bf0aa8dfe48 raskolnikov went straight up to them.
0x721ede191520c07dca21bffcf2c4a846f673e300 “what do you want?”
0x9d29920cbd650f71e2cecc3552e7e36e08cf255b asked one of the porters.
0xb9928f07c7bcf732fce6c11b4fa8690bae2a24f3 “have you been to the police office?”
0x06fca2a2804bde28c0c9dc42dd36dffa1f2547ef “i’ve just been there.

0x38a32c633c077c83e11d95ae3f37f8484899e2db “is it open?”

0x52aaff5156f81a630137cf1f6ec5b7861978feb3 what do you want?”
0x2955163192704904e49cf023600773b943b56c7a raskolnikov made no reply, but stood beside them lost in thought.
0x72ff7ac443570fbf4a71a713c19ef99ea6b3b81f “he’s been to look at the flat,” said the elder workman, coming forward.
0xc1f0476f6fd74e83ba84dcb857810bcf000be9d7 “which flat?”
0xd847c08d7eeaf26df26a07f756ee0b7cb2d330f4 “where we are at work.
0x1ffbacae8ff7e8665b1de625fa9489fd0fc56368 ‘why have you washed away the blood?’
0x0b5beba42fd5a6d819d574ecb1a4db1267b13a7f says he.
0x7540cf429c50c4f5103dd24c94b65db2fdfb272d ‘there has been a murder here,’ says he, ‘and i’ve come to take it.’
0xd6f26587d8752758f40714f87d527669036f066f and he began ringing at the bell, all but broke it.
0x6599c4d7aa59bb176d10f4d6230744258d5b6bc3 ‘come to the police station,’ says he.

0xcfff3cfc3843a72df7c74a71f0a039d0c9cf07de he wouldn’t leave us.”
0x4d71352a4c8c9a8ccf36b5bdb7a12120342c0118 the porter looked at raskolnikov, frowning and perplexed.
0x172c524090935016dd765de56a3cabdf913cd862 “who are you?”
0xc73534d7f6ac6e447db18a8f8ad036d649871b09 he shouted as impressively as he could.
0xd53a068173245a701f384f09f5df7a0ad597c2d9 “i am rodion romanovitch raskolnikov, formerly a student, i live in shil’s house, not far from here, flat number 14, ask the porter, he knows me.”
0x5a2ae96408ae8f65a98ac37bda3922cb434e69bf raskolnikov said all this in a lazy, dreamy voice, not turning round, but looking intently into the darkening street.
0xbe4741adba8674c63a9b27caf8ee56e1cfc0494f “why have you been to the flat?”
0x8853d60160c0ae5c44590533c49f737925eed88a “to look at it.”
0xedf3dccecbacf714d6ee46f36470827457611534 “what is there to look at?”
0xc6ec690bfe227d3dfecbe3ea4a4c3f2774773033 “take him straight to the police station,” the man in the long coat jerked in abruptly.
0xa81a3fd9edc14b275be3cbd49d9d481ba3131148 raskolnikov looked intently at him over his shoulder and said in the same slow, lazy tones: “come along.”
0xfc69cbfb65244a96cc2a5d881815aa94781de137 “yes, take him,” the man went on more confidently.
0x3dd3a88610a3d648933af6fd0e3c698a02037de2 “why was he going into _that_, what’s in his mind, eh?”
0x81f64d1d934f77ac0a3257b649122cd342e4c89b “he’s not drunk, but god knows what’s the matter with him,” muttered the workman.
0xc907aeec96b23d0dfc2b529b9583b37c69ac1c82 “but what do you want?”
0xdd08fe0f2519d172f59a7618c2494c24b7a2f9b1 the porter shouted again, beginning to get angry in earnest--“why are you hanging about?”
0x6dc141a260bddfca18c4413cd17c923ca3b16f30 “you funk the police station then?”
0xd909d3fea370702de3c9103197666eb4d0b009c7 said raskolnikov jeeringly.
0x6a2fae3bb2146a74fe6b7030a7fe5f7100997021 “how funk it?
0xe48373ba8482da95a9f8baa952779b2f2042b3db why are you hanging about?”
0x37c0b097eb02131dcdd3c83385256822040e46fd “he’s a rogue!”
0x1e6a1474b718c0d301ade9d1c5d8e98f563b5ecd shouted the peasant woman.
0xa67c8ce922a3114ea6e484d9d8bfd6016b599d71 “why waste time talking to him?”
0x42523d388087958c466de6332642ab398305a3e1 cried the other porter, a huge peasant in a full open coat and with keys on his belt.
0xf04db6ae22518ed0f02218c6724f0089f4b13969 “get along!
0x788be2720c6506469225bbf8a7891189dd6b60df he is a rogue and no mistake.

0x3c2399503c33c1f6960b0e74ae725e9ad2d2de97 and seizing raskolnikov by the shoulder he flung him into the street.
0xaab5718857c7c37777c2eeb80ee486b42a796a2d he lurched forward, but recovered his footing, looked at the spectators in silence and walked away.
0xf3c16cab52d231e32227bee17cd48e88123f1e57 “strange man!”
0x6504380f69a32561ee1a03fab49bc370f44010f9 observed the workman.
0x39e69c86b363249a586554a81d7779c1c154f89b “there are strange folks about nowadays,” said the woman.
0xa87ffa22cecfabfc4113d14d9d86983ecc83917a “you should have taken him to the police station all the same,” said the man in the long coat.
0x6ec5d60b160e22f75ec75d3b04fc4167f57a9ad1 “better have nothing to do with him,” decided the big porter.
0x6fbd82dcf3474dbaabc4825d3663c961895cc762 “a regular rogue!
0x8203dd6d853ace1f3f0ace2d95b89576e9954197 just what he wants, you may be sure, but once take him up, you won’t get rid of him.... we know the sort!”
0x64b798f452121a1c2dcbe1acdfbee75ad6469616 “shall i go there or not?”
0x18dcb3fa387c281134d4fa90546a97c323171691 thought raskolnikov, standing in the middle of the thoroughfare at the cross-roads, and he looked about him, as though expecting from someone a decisive word.
0x0edb6087d1abb826e5f6d67ffc201f30afd99485 but no sound came, all was dead and silent like the stones on which he walked, dead to him, to him alone.... all at once at the end of the street, two hundred yards away, in the gathering dusk he saw a crowd and heard talk and shouts.
0x857cd9451ac2224d4fe13a15c7a372a3f804cb6e in the middle of the crowd stood a carriage.... a light gleamed in the middle of the street.
0xf7421ecf93fec117c5974f6568bf915fd84f7750 “what is it?”
0x487a85a33d1d3459a13c1d788ac1b0b1a8d4be8c raskolnikov turned to the right and went up to the crowd.
0xc2ddae44eef4ce2ad2ea2c7f72e44ea74cb985e5 he seemed to clutch at everything and smiled coldly when he recognised it, for he had fully made up his mind to go to the police station and knew that it would all soon be over.
0x90b8fd3d8eef301d36ff1519e34b2bcf6f4d289d chapter vii an elegant carriage stood in the middle of the road with a pair of spirited grey horses; there was no one in it, and the coachman had got off his box and stood by; the horses were being held by the bridle.... a mass of people had gathered round, the police standing in front.
0xd87ae7adc6267afdfc72d4f8e4eaab9170f7262a one of them held a lighted lantern which he was turning on something lying close to the wheels.
0x24ae4a99bbbf28e27bf29709bf5055bc09ed552d everyone was talking, shouting, exclaiming; the coachman seemed at a loss and kept repeating: “what a misfortune!
0x72ebfe8773eb55946779e5e7ab2e8b3d1ca6c4ba good lord, what a misfortune!”
0x5fc0452a4af588e9896ff1fa7a0e8f797f75afef raskolnikov pushed his way in as far as he could, and succeeded at last in seeing the object of the commotion and interest.
0x73051cce8e587ec2cd08ab67af600a8ce714c024 on the ground a man who had been run over lay apparently unconscious, and covered with blood; he was very badly dressed, but not like a workman.
0xe47e28e4a373a34ef1ad71309e55a52964f8072c blood was flowing from his head and face; his face was crushed, mutilated and disfigured.
0xb37737ddbc69d77f0375dda8ce97714c40dc5f32 he was evidently badly injured.
0x192742bcb166167ec51e05e633d016a69ef2c03b “merciful heaven!”
0xfe730f8da3447cda53907c498611630c0ee40f97 wailed the coachman, “what more could i do?
0x76faf82aeb8e2250ab43acac3333a62cebfeac8f if i’d been driving fast or had not shouted to him, but i was going quietly, not in a hurry.
0xdb263e533cd3adc56645d98e992ab72146c952db everyone could see i was going along just like everybody else.
0x1c7a45a98bedfd373d16074b09f71c18f7a16a47 a drunken man can’t walk straight, we all know.... i saw him crossing the street, staggering and almost falling.
0x6362c0e414485d065227a96613099c45c529d4da i shouted again and a second and a third time, then i held the horses in, but he fell straight under their feet!
0x3412bdf6abaeedfa9c30f3eaba14149800ab85c4 either he did it on purpose or he was very tipsy.... the horses are young and ready to take fright... they started, he screamed... that made them worse.
0xf505e4405250374315840f502da73ad20199e641 that’s how it happened!”
0x0ebdc0e0058db48c8bff03852f3c7e5032c06497 “that’s just how it was,” a voice in the crowd confirmed.
0xc30e8a409e4b86ce33b50796378f1057b7b94e1f “he shouted, that’s true, he shouted three times,” another voice declared.
0xa4143a3f2fe481357cf195e8da3485b765342232 “three times it was, we all heard it,” shouted a third.
0x41ec7422ec382b06f94abd8aa56c29d7d503b2a1 but the coachman was not very much distressed and frightened.
0x21f67a91082c28cda979840cdd7dabce04471954 it was evident that the carriage belonged to a rich and important person who was awaiting it somewhere; the police, of course, were in no little anxiety to avoid upsetting his arrangements.
0x5aecf34181e8c305ace20570859104276b127ae1 all they had to do was to take the injured man to the police station and the hospital.
0xca4a4c8e0daca7ca002998b73387aa9413dc5757 no one knew his name.
0x53bf3954de86502b6de7caecf27f739e8337b652 meanwhile raskolnikov had squeezed in and stooped closer over him.
0xda20f8c4c4eb9bba2a0035e1ab5945b0ac139c8c the lantern suddenly lighted up the unfortunate man’s face.
0xca4f7e5a8ce6ae91c6426ff639c3af98426b4f01 he recognised him.
0x68e1e331859a1a18486505fe76b349c692b6488c “i know him!
0x80009ba38c99ad631653b47f63104bf1d3aa698a i know him!”
0x4af77e1357f29c6257820eddd5700db5b1891f25 he shouted, pushing to the front.
0xb1baa2b3f235d096cfaca626f52896aad35befbe “it’s a government clerk retired from the service, marmeladov.
0x4efac22120d0408e9883e9378071a90fcfdfa18d he lives close by in kozel’s house.... make haste for a doctor!
0xb4e13c7e56727bf5a28bb806c2bf3ef4a772b684 i will pay, see?”
0x11b6557dc098dbf41eafb1901c3e138a34456b51 he pulled money out of his pocket and showed it to the policeman.
0x17e34b49f495ed55a8b89f42fbc82e1b5be9866b he was in violent agitation.
0x04da092fba39273f5235de71d949eeac2b074499 the police were glad that they had found out who the man was.
0x893476e4ca5112658afba9136cdd3c0670c19132 raskolnikov gave his own name and address, and, as earnestly as if it had been his father, he besought the police to carry the unconscious marmeladov to his lodging at once.
0x1879bb9ecdbe5c1732eb73ac75b7cff6ec8f719d “just here, three houses away,” he said eagerly, “the house belongs to kozel, a rich german.
0x0c9a788bd1b445f313bea47ec4a284ad67321e63 he was going home, no doubt drunk.
0x73802d2f204fb85e0481c99d516b59379927c4fa i know him, he is a drunkard.
0x234907209a7f65b922e4a0f1fe66296dd126f893 he has a family there, a wife, children, he has one daughter.... it will take time to take him to the hospital, and there is sure to be a doctor in the house.
0xf40c8514a8e752c287c97e4cf879436496bb2e2a i’ll pay, i’ll pay!
0x0ed434eaa7f3612979321d564b42e7b17a691a24 at least he will be looked after at home... they will help him at once.
0x8715175ac98cd3e9ed5a8b261303b35f4a467101 but he’ll die before you get him to the hospital.”
0xf8965d112bb819081f0291aa2583d6bc8d90415c he managed to slip something unseen into the policeman’s hand.
0xa56d189793e90a7223f0fd44515632b777bd8fc2 but the thing was straightforward and legitimate, and in any case help was closer here.
0xb0f85f0e807636c97e242641e1ffc750ca0acac9 they raised the injured man; people volunteered to help.
0xbf1ecc8a634c33f38572de7a0a26c9878a7cca2d kozel’s house was thirty yards away.
0x5ef5f79781a542cd760d341824c3b2996981c9b0 raskolnikov walked behind, carefully holding marmeladov’s head and showing the way.
0xf8afe64a377aac6aa62ebb8ece1548465f9d0ae0 “this way, this way!
0xa712e53792e5d6d3aa0ddc1eea78b988f145b4a3 we must take him upstairs head foremost.

0x016c604114ec274f4b23bcddc5c8609f07e4302b i’ll pay, i’ll make it worth your while,” he muttered.
0xfe7c0769e9dd1f91992fb8ae99198373f268a9c8 katerina ivanovna had just begun, as she always did at every free moment, walking to and fro in her little room from window to stove and back again, with her arms folded across her chest, talking to herself and coughing.
0xe118268859b0e85465f626e360fb4a175bd7f7af of late she had begun to talk more than ever to her eldest girl, polenka, a child of ten, who, though there was much she did not understand, understood very well that her mother needed her, and so always watched her with her big clever eyes and strove her utmost to appear to understand.
0x032ae8fe9d7e6e4edbdfa6c8c62887923537314f this time polenka was undressing her little brother, who had been unwell all day and was going to bed.
0x815f2cb7e470f80656438be1f8d54a4405182eaf the boy was waiting for her to take off his shirt, which had to be washed at night.
0x66ddf8a9d2592103e40e29cb78a745fb9250c798 he was sitting straight and motionless on a chair, with a silent, serious face, with his legs stretched out straight before him--heels together and toes turned out.
0xcd4c0fe46b358c99b71c8c62fdfeb5fdba7823a2 he was listening to what his mother was saying to his sister, sitting perfectly still with pouting lips and wide-open eyes, just as all good little boys have to sit when they are undressed to go to bed.
0x08346559674f5588f5acd5de6b5699abea89929e a little girl, still younger, dressed literally in rags, stood at the screen, waiting for her turn.
0xd31e5279e6c1de507213c8eb783d01744d21d192 the door on to the stairs was open to relieve them a little from the clouds of tobacco smoke which floated in from the other rooms and brought on long terrible fits of coughing in the poor, consumptive woman.
0x2dc1b122600a66ee57a9862fac4a9bc324474404 katerina ivanovna seemed to have grown even thinner during that week and the hectic flush on her face was brighter than ever.
0x957fe7fa16ec0cbaa7f8b8bed8aac61136496333 “you wouldn’t believe, you can’t imagine, polenka,” she said, walking about the room, “what a happy luxurious life we had in my papa’s house and how this drunkard has brought me, and will bring you all, to ruin!

0xbb704bdf5f00cb050c471fec5d24bbde042d3db2 katerina ivanovna stood, turning white and gasping for breath.
0x4df5d84974d335af5d720f96dfbe17eac26f4141 the children were terrified.
0x6c93576860bea74746e36d9732c96f8dbbb487d6 little lida screamed, rushed to polenka and clutched at her, trembling all over.
0x2ff68bd2a1098167210104a7a2df8972c66bc696 having laid marmeladov down, raskolnikov flew to katerina ivanovna.
0x347c2de0073d377ca6d4af36475953e9811a75c8 “for god’s sake be calm, don’t be frightened!”
0x20a5665e0b498d90d3796e593777739f8d930eae he said, speaking quickly, “he was crossing the road and was run over by a carriage, don’t be frightened, he will come to, i told them bring him here... i’ve been here already, you remember?
0x187ae4e1264653d794678f113844d1b25ee409f6 he will come to; i’ll pay!”
0x05b5f30654aab22e7e9ca554bd697fe75faca9b8 “he’s done it this time!”
0x62228515b6c7e71d22fc53f467b930e1e430811c katerina ivanovna cried despairingly and she rushed to her husband.
0x9a71d1a173204936701eb3edfc823690f2db02be raskolnikov noticed at once that she was not one of those women who swoon easily.
0x6b9aab3bf835bf7bc3f03fb532b1af16d82443be she instantly placed under the luckless man’s head a pillow, which no one had thought of and began undressing and examining him.
0x6ebefeaff7eb0ad5c0c5afdae2e0399d2624141d she kept her head, forgetting herself, biting her trembling lips and stifling the screams which were ready to break from her.
0x6db6c8a0fc251913b8a2b3463627d741030b50fa raskolnikov meanwhile induced someone to run for a doctor.
0x1702897b87ebf70fbf83e028f798c0ebd437e1dd there was a doctor, it appeared, next door but one.
0xb15812b27759a9851f5735d9b1f981fa8d34705a “i’ve sent for a doctor,” he kept assuring katerina ivanovna, “don’t be uneasy, i’ll pay.
0xc54b384640b79fbd11ffff851319f6597968a663 haven’t you water?... and give me a napkin or a towel, anything, as quick as you can.... he is injured, but not killed, believe me.... we shall see what the doctor says!”
0x2f0da441a0ce822691a4798026ddacc2de1ae828 katerina ivanovna ran to the window; there, on a broken chair in the corner, a large earthenware basin full of water had been stood, in readiness for washing her children’s and husband’s linen that night.
0xb3bfb1653c7013c01037044db3b209759d753611 this washing was done by katerina ivanovna at night at least twice a week, if not oftener.
0x2ffb8e9d62dfa015091a03ecb59b8fb9a46f17d8 for the family had come to such a pass that they were practically without change of linen, and katerina ivanovna could not endure uncleanliness and, rather than see dirt in the house, she preferred to wear herself out at night, working beyond her strength when the rest were asleep, so as to get the wet linen hung on a line and dry by the morning.
0x4e10412f29a59b73e00355d231ef43894aea5382 she took up the basin of water at raskolnikov’s request, but almost fell down with her burden.
0x67dc627821c2e6266baf331528799406ff8b3820 but the latter had already succeeded in finding a towel, wetted it and began washing the blood off marmeladov’s face.
0x6a724b12a984d519b54f58d6173ff1fae2a9477a katerina ivanovna stood by, breathing painfully and pressing her hands to her breast.
0x395d608e4be0f8d1bb9c9ab77e3b1c5caa0cf8c6 she was in need of attention herself.
0xefb4103d4c163dc3a2f392f0ec575b20fec1efc1 raskolnikov began to realise that he might have made a mistake in having the injured man brought here.
0x11f21ed2d5b94fdb0a481ae3d05ea501933a938e the policeman, too, stood in hesitation.
0x0479b2e518446bdff90de61254b03de97786e1c2 “polenka,” cried katerina ivanovna, “run to sonia, make haste.
0xe5f1a3f8a31746324cafff3a5452af56c46b48ba if you don’t find her at home, leave word that her father has been run over and that she is to come here at once... when she comes in.
0x671edca2ff089f6a075a224ea08f4a7944006a98 run, polenka!
0xed5a0a3fde87e039c5e18359e1812846e754ceb3 there, put on the shawl.”
0xf8c65fb39a82f7494f7892a0a39bcb5cf1260965 “run your fastest!”
0xf84dca106ef31975382b741936e9c18ddc984f79 cried the little boy on the chair suddenly, after which he relapsed into the same dumb rigidity, with round eyes, his heels thrust forward and his toes spread out.
0x2492c057cf8565371c706bec0bcf9fae6970d2d1 meanwhile the room had become so full of people that you couldn’t have dropped a pin.
0x1e5ad98ac83ecf41d708830a7646b739b25f90ad the policemen left, all except one, who remained for a time, trying to drive out the people who came in from the stairs.
0x07b02551036200ae9b01b34c7340f617ca13f99c almost all madame lippevechsel’s lodgers had streamed in from the inner rooms of the flat; at first they were squeezed together in the doorway, but afterwards they overflowed into the room.
0xa7ee1302ef3815f168bf284710ca6a6510d7f249 katerina ivanovna flew into a fury.
0xb609e392d06810c82873fc2e09f0f5068e857c20 “you might let him die in peace, at least,” she shouted at the crowd, “is it a spectacle for you to gape at?
0x81ec24e9fccf1def372b02f0d1b17e006f605d1b with cigarettes!
0x929d656ab236746d4f7877125972f19d336a7b44 (cough, cough, cough!)
0x895c6b6c60695d3ac9769fb2a1bd31e856a754d4 you might as well keep your hats on.... and there is one in his hat!... get away!
0x949b6b65424ae688ca33b19e094576ef3c47eae1 you should respect the dead, at least!”
0x6e1f97cb3818e12c4bdc556c92cadc6a68d71cd7 her cough choked her--but her reproaches were not without result.
0x65db2fb24b1fa8a17b506f94c10302f9c15c60cf they evidently stood in some awe of katerina ivanovna.
0xbc2f378b99414f37d50f2ab65fb34e4cb814dc72 the lodgers, one after another, squeezed back into the doorway with that strange inner feeling of satisfaction which may be observed in the presence of a sudden accident, even in those nearest and dearest to the victim, from which no living man is exempt, even in spite of the sincerest sympathy and compassion.
0x57d24c36cf7a0b3fca62e3fd6f44b7d33510a2ff voices outside were heard, however, speaking of the hospital and saying that they’d no business to make a disturbance here.
0x59085e5cee5ae64372dd17dfaeacbe9f0a283df5 “no business to die!”
0x5a62d51b4380e9114b075298617aa0e68f0f73e4 cried katerina ivanovna, and she was rushing to the door to vent her wrath upon them, but in the doorway came face to face with madame lippevechsel who had only just heard of the accident and ran in to restore order.
0xfea5e14741e3f51d71d8c0b3d7dbdbfae8bb431d she was a particularly quarrelsome and irresponsible german.
0xc0c55fb4f0e742c007025243de7f15006111fb9b “ah, my god!”
0x49febec2cc3ece76eea6c6db3bb4ef5fbe0f131e she cried, clasping her hands, “your husband drunken horses have trampled!
0x589593a92a56bba24cf49a1187e47e1cb06a34ef to the hospital with him!
0x5cd0390b593a9185d26674feed23551344a5bd69 i am the landlady!”
0xd67176654149f98d96715ebdc21bca459a16dbb0 “amalia ludwigovna, i beg you to recollect what you are saying,” katerina ivanovna began haughtily (she always took a haughty tone with the landlady that she might “remember her place” and even now could not deny herself this satisfaction).
0xb69650dfbaebdd33d00c2254efde425605f9e63a “amalia ludwigovna...” “i have you once before told that you to call me amalia ludwigovna may not dare; i am amalia ivanovna.”
0x18e38e7eb7d3559a229542163a93f7b836ecd6d3 “you are not amalia ivanovna, but amalia ludwigovna, and as i am not one of your despicable flatterers like mr. lebeziatnikov, who’s laughing behind the door at this moment (a laugh and a cry of ‘they are at it again’ was in fact audible at the door) so i shall always call you amalia ludwigovna, though i fail to understand why you dislike that name.
0xecdab1647140ff9757b5ec292f4ca3e2059fc8c8 you can see for yourself what has happened to semyon zaharovitch; he is dying.
0xf077970a4b27aae4ca6b183a1ad3b1822c9cdbeb i beg you to close that door at once and to admit no one.
0x7a3ff4e5eded569f80f08add97cee4b6c744e772 let him at least die in peace!
0xb804f1a0fba4d784598622ff739d7b70d79e67ce or i warn you the governor-general, himself, shall be informed of your conduct to-morrow.
0xbb4a7866bb139edeefade8e90e38f011095ff4a6 the prince knew me as a girl; he remembers semyon zaharovitch well and has often been a benefactor to him.
0x68dc68c2622f4f9a0182f1c3ff350c7f1cfd6507 everyone knows that semyon zaharovitch had many friends and protectors, whom he abandoned himself from an honourable pride, knowing his unhappy weakness, but now (she pointed to raskolnikov) a generous young man has come to our assistance, who has wealth and connections and whom semyon zaharovitch has known from a child.
0x79ab53150d5ad685301a7fec9f1fcd909415b078 you may rest assured, amalia ludwigovna...” all this was uttered with extreme rapidity, getting quicker and quicker, but a cough suddenly cut short katerina ivanovna’s eloquence.
0xce38ab54dc12048dc4cef202b1790ed489501ad8 at that instant the dying man recovered consciousness and uttered a groan; she ran to him.
0x594dae7eb1de43243a5907c1537b67ec2fd664f4 the injured man opened his eyes and without recognition or understanding gazed at raskolnikov who was bending over him.
0x462f980a3aaa30aebee273fb1c9226c34c172098 he drew deep, slow, painful breaths; blood oozed at the corners of his mouth and drops of perspiration came out on his forehead.
0xe38c00636884b504f3c724bc44aab935a1b0b75c not recognising raskolnikov, he began looking round uneasily.
0x425522e653ebab357167d14c9793ddd1b7acceec katerina ivanovna looked at him with a sad but stern face, and tears trickled from her eyes.
0x82774e16ed3d1c9e03a2821612a91cc11d7ded63 “my god!
0x5813be2a4ab6402c76a5a58f6ad4011afc138c20 his whole chest is crushed!
0x83217fc8f69978795f309e5e70eb61854b35d1c8 how he is bleeding,” she said in despair.
0x43903989d256a09323717d0282f9b26a74a04b4b “we must take off his clothes.
0x1f509042b7cedc457c3654e72013f615efeda544 turn a little, semyon zaharovitch, if you can,” she cried to him.
0xd60ed59e462e0fcbdf6253dd694ab05fee27f877 marmeladov recognised her.
0x5b1bd13daae7e2db2e6d9b438ee4acf719fb2afa “a priest,” he articulated huskily.
0x304d8ebc7a88bf5639cd74ab9539888fbdb426d5 katerina ivanovna walked to the window, laid her head against the window frame and exclaimed in despair: “oh, cursed life!”
0xbbad625e64cd05ee524a42dec8b81fcfd0d73dab “a priest,” the dying man said again after a moment’s silence.
0x8068e7244983dc4f96b779de1b3cfd457ac7528a “they’ve gone for him,” katerina ivanovna shouted to him, he obeyed her shout and was silent.
0x901da7d1010ee38040637bd4175743339d282f67 with sad and timid eyes he looked for her; she returned and stood by his pillow.
0xee2e65c6c5ce0d31588d4713d81ad21a87cdf99f he seemed a little easier but not for long.
0x56f002555288252e0c9343488e6ac14bc3235a04 soon his eyes rested on little lida, his favourite, who was shaking in the corner, as though she were in a fit, and staring at him with her wondering childish eyes.
0x4221ce4a2cb2df29b2cbeaf55343b812cd48e737 “a-ah,” he signed towards her uneasily.
0x97cd26e686987a6e7b75aaa2818740c619bf5728 he wanted to say something.
0x3a96e03a9c52c065d4a0e9f0bb82bb2faeb8d83c “what now?”
0x87a0c4f6fd64c3656e0ee9f4efad3c72dd7e21c9 cried katerina ivanovna.
0xf5993650d1ce0f6c695bb1822a16de6ecba55d52 “barefoot, barefoot!”
0xecbaadcd1abb005dfed6e5a0300abeb67b55945d he muttered, indicating with frenzied eyes the child’s bare feet.
0x13745ac599164a1e60d9b99f34abafc5965d7be9 “be silent,” katerina ivanovna cried irritably, “you know why she is barefooted.”
0x7011e4472b548bc72573613d9c930cb2a41de540 “thank god, the doctor,” exclaimed raskolnikov, relieved.
0x76ca4e7ce37f903d2d4308787ddadacf05ca589f the doctor came in, a precise little old man, a german, looking about him mistrustfully; he went up to the sick man, took his pulse, carefully felt his head and with the help of katerina ivanovna he unbuttoned the blood-stained shirt, and bared the injured man’s chest.
0x0cf0d9212037efa4b6cff1d00f05ca7364c5127f it was gashed, crushed and fractured, several ribs on the right side were broken.
0xe14db3c04e5d68cef8a84a129471ad5af031428a on the left side, just over the heart, was a large, sinister-looking yellowish-black bruise--a cruel kick from the horse’s hoof.
0x133ad7bf2a222bb8e86e45fbe708170415f0e9c7 the doctor frowned.
0xaebff6da6435138e914169a4f9adf2e1d2b06253 the policeman told him that he was caught in the wheel and turned round with it for thirty yards on the road.
0xdabd675554779b75b9fd5b42dfdf698bf358b4f4 “it’s wonderful that he has recovered consciousness,” the doctor whispered softly to raskolnikov.
0xd0b50801a42295bfdc35a100aa9f9b5000641d1b “what do you think of him?”
0xacfbf23c8f7ae5c818fb1cd1580839b4957670ae he asked.
0xbbbe8f8bfe4bd85a984775a717829fe3532bd1de “he will die immediately.”
0x47b4724318fd4e1bc816bf89f08d9b1293efa16d “is there really no hope?”
0x81bdb21d04326f8aa5b1bfb20f250126a21f8a31 “not the faintest!
0xc071df905721c3fd7eea085ad1b691977e8eceff he is at the last gasp.... his head is badly injured, too... hm... i could bleed him if you like, but... it would be useless.
0x9b14a3c80a13cfae46199591a6ebee7217479bc6 he is bound to die within the next five or ten minutes.”
0x579475b752e86490a80164ddce7525d5676aa476 “better bleed him then.”
0xd50fe812e225e235d723dab725be59831005076b “if you like.... but i warn you it will be perfectly useless.”
0x5e3a5911a209d816e0c315b3a06589e468e640d4 at that moment other steps were heard; the crowd in the passage parted, and the priest, a little, grey old man, appeared in the doorway bearing the sacrament.
0x0086f6df0a3c5748e474aa8d3a3d3156141ec489 a policeman had gone for him at the time of the accident.
0x0d42cbf70d2ce1b9921ce8f18b3c1d015e780b9e the doctor changed places with him, exchanging glances with him.
0xf67c955126ab546c91259a2d1ed4e9c53dae2863 raskolnikov begged the doctor to remain a little while.
0x2db0778dab1db3de479382f21e46cd55cf42e0d2 he shrugged his shoulders and remained.
0x3ace06a8a0614eea45aa180a9e85a54a31e7119d all stepped back.
0x5f53b246d9d1573b10587dc1a7f25126182e711c the confession was soon over.
0x11d7db6145c5446eb787459cb9134fe9b298c473 the dying man probably understood little; he could only utter indistinct broken sounds.
0x8a57398828236abedf25aa585fb74e99664d6a48 katerina ivanovna took little lida, lifted the boy from the chair, knelt down in the corner by the stove and made the children kneel in front of her.
0x949f101977166cfb7ae17c15e7c1b2630c1c5347 the little girl was still trembling; but the boy, kneeling on his little bare knees, lifted his hand rhythmically, crossing himself with precision and bowed down, touching the floor with his forehead, which seemed to afford him especial satisfaction.
0x018ee67970c47dfbb82543bb98da7339933354b1 katerina ivanovna bit her lips and held back her tears; she prayed, too, now and then pulling straight the boy’s shirt, and managed to cover the girl’s bare shoulders with a kerchief, which she took from the chest without rising from her knees or ceasing to pray.
0x63f5c57e4940e6ef905e0c74f2d610970e2daa98 meanwhile the door from the inner rooms was opened inquisitively again.
0x32894e93b596eac69be7a1af81fdb1feb6271ed1 in the passage the crowd of spectators from all the flats on the staircase grew denser and denser, but they did not venture beyond the threshold.
0x92e07ed0ab2e8c355ca6ab7cdd0f901128bd60dd a single candle-end lighted up the scene.
0x7edaf990fdd28401f40eaaab0423ba5de11e7844 at that moment polenka forced her way through the crowd at the door.
0x7ffc2b8a2f8f9f18cf374fbee9aacb8b59135468 she came in panting from running so fast, took off her kerchief, looked for her mother, went up to her and said, “she’s coming, i met her in the street.”
0x7061b9427f22825aa6ae6c2ab8db70a0d33e5f49 her mother made her kneel beside her.
0x33f32d00a8434e596f4d93e33aaf57b299e1489a timidly and noiselessly a young girl made her way through the crowd, and strange was her appearance in that room, in the midst of want, rags, death and despair.
0xb1df441c9daae43e9bd0604e519e0f52331caa8b she, too, was in rags, her attire was all of the cheapest, but decked out in gutter finery of a special stamp, unmistakably betraying its shameful purpose.
0x3ffe3f3fe2be20ab3c99e7653199b406e1b32e8b sonia stopped short in the doorway and looked about her bewildered, unconscious of everything.
0x64e2a266f5114496a74f4e434d9adcec17674ff9 she forgot her fourth-hand, gaudy silk dress, so unseemly here with its ridiculous long train, and her immense crinoline that filled up the whole doorway, and her light-coloured shoes, and the parasol she brought with her, though it was no use at night, and the absurd round straw hat with its flaring flame-coloured feather.
0x4f9926e290f16d5c360699ea6c2bd0903ce082f5 under this rakishly-tilted hat was a pale, frightened little face with lips parted and eyes staring in terror.
0x8751c908d9e4eab475aaf751a1e4aa906739c6c8 sonia was a small thin girl of eighteen with fair hair, rather pretty, with wonderful blue eyes.
0x4ed5d883b0ded474a6a46098296dc27e78a12f17 she looked intently at the bed and the priest; she too was out of breath with running.
0x7672ed25acf7fa29b5b26474db4050463de9a1e9 at last whispers, some words in the crowd probably, reached her.
0x57254b87c1e2de4f38309721db3998f0b99292a2 she looked down and took a step forward into the room, still keeping close to the door.
0x8f1239ec5fce3afcb96c317ca641677307aa2918 the service was over.
0xcf4dcb8cc6fb7fa7d29facffb329672aa5f1e345 katerina ivanovna went up to her husband again.
0x28a7961595df84d7c1a6297d24742c181a0f1cc1 the priest stepped back and turned to say a few words of admonition and consolation to katerina ivanovna on leaving.

0x1e85fd101e9ca9513101212f0261f5aa17b4ff8e she interrupted sharply and irritably, pointing to the little ones.
0x6df12344de26525230badcb0c36f14d5aca49a3d “god is merciful; look to the most high for succour,” the priest began.
0x69ff88d0842b5baedd974f460e7120caf3d3907a “ach!
0x785b87ce78c0367bf2ba659732b5a0ff33b90031 he is merciful, but not to us.”
0x374dcff049828a3a9a8ee4c81dae8be65e5eaf89 “that’s a sin, a sin, madam,” observed the priest, shaking his head.
0xd6134b2451f0cc9706c96ca73042efaedb37ac97 “and isn’t that a sin?”
0xd8fa0446605922dc950edb6b3e053cd6c0cea695 cried katerina ivanovna, pointing to the dying man.
0x00e94062015878351f2606a3b6d964b2ffa1d997 “perhaps those who have involuntarily caused the accident will agree to compensate you, at least for the loss of his earnings.”
0xc3e6e3610d849530a3e4a122ed4d545ccf932144 “you don’t understand!”
0x775ef8e5466ed32506dbe4a71180c926b2acb353 cried katerina ivanovna angrily waving her hand.
0xd440aa53d6e026b99e6a37008f025049e339d0db “and why should they compensate me?
0x0b4eadbc9706065d1170476387dcc86df4997d8e why, he was drunk and threw himself under the horses!
0x77aef0ec476b9dd3eb61d1a11d46fb1e92af7d99 what earnings?
0x5985c625cbde3c3acc09cc0cf2f8f629b2238e9a he brought us in nothing but misery.

0x2f074d1fe18dcef2a0354243251f5e15c056a59a “you must forgive in the hour of death, that’s a sin, madam, such feelings are a great sin.”
0xbbcaf84bd70d589515b4d27c241a057fd9192f51 katerina ivanovna was busy with the dying man; she was giving him water, wiping the blood and sweat from his head, setting his pillow straight, and had only turned now and then for a moment to address the priest.
0x371333f7d259f0daa4dc724a9b3cfa699df055d6 now she flew at him almost in a frenzy.
0xacb3bbca80fbac84086863efaf04b8932596f0e4 “ah, father!
0x7bf65b612d7afae9b8cf9171b5648d280b5130a1 that’s words and only words!
0xeda09cc854a6da04376429b5796ee363211a57b1 forgive!
0xe126ac0817e8683cd77f97d83ee31957549a3237 if he’d not been run over, he’d have come home to-day drunk and his only shirt dirty and in rags and he’d have fallen asleep like a log, and i should have been sousing and rinsing till daybreak, washing his rags and the children’s and then drying them by the window and as soon as it was daylight i should have been darning them.
0xd35064741818d151da586061265a7bbb950a1a86 that’s how i spend my nights!... what’s the use of talking of forgiveness!
0x9a1e0cbe803e08812611708946be3c1568858b87 i have forgiven as it is!”
0x273532b2b9cae831d09228bc6422609000e33474 a terrible hollow cough interrupted her words.
0x3dce8e6f68d2cedddfb644d4c3251b6df70e7aac she put her handkerchief to her lips and showed it to the priest, pressing her other hand to her aching chest.
0x14362cf7f35ef641d1cbbc0ca698d9394b611cb3 the handkerchief was covered with blood.
0x149a78fe4d1c42597652bf9ff1fa937f13d8c7ac the priest bowed his head and said nothing.
0x75aac5d33c0ac6a39abc5853c5dbdd8b1a7cdd86 marmeladov was in the last agony; he did not take his eyes off the face of katerina ivanovna, who was bending over him again.
0x44e8f04d77979e3ec6ea5d2c1d32e3fa873bc3d9 he kept trying to say something to her; he began moving his tongue with difficulty and articulating indistinctly, but katerina ivanovna, understanding that he wanted to ask her forgiveness, called peremptorily to him: “be silent!
0xcbc2ba93147d667ef0460ae14f806b8815680185 no need!
0xa6798311d46b9d95ec9fec39af654646858b0e1e i know what you want to say!”
0x58b812e5cfed8451456a6b58a501375887971164 and the sick man was silent, but at the same instant his wandering eyes strayed to the doorway and he saw sonia.
0x92a349ca7bd2702870c0b8f8a689a75aab7045af till then he had not noticed her: she was standing in the shadow in a corner.
0xa24df5bd1fd8156271e1e843ab5f58bd0495cdc3 “who’s that?
0x3df48b1626863c7f90b4115543b8b61908c8ab81 who’s that?”
0xae9956028b2faa13758b1340d973ccb6816bc1b1 he said suddenly in a thick gasping voice, in agitation, turning his eyes in horror towards the door where his daughter was standing, and trying to sit up.
0x1f1a74e598da16a51b9cb438526fa0930ae929c3 “lie down!
0xc226699826a327a96ec41a1ce8c7a3877e79d3ff lie do-own!”
0x87a0c4f6fd64c3656e0ee9f4efad3c72dd7e21c9 cried katerina ivanovna.
0x741597e8365eb37bf2ebf68b3f36df08c523e747 with unnatural strength he had succeeded in propping himself on his elbow.
0xc02e7f2ff153a0c9b162a7266a76e0aeee7cef9c he looked wildly and fixedly for some time on his daughter, as though not recognising her.
0x4b384e892d50aff4009659f6c8591edab1ebd0e7 he had never seen her before in such attire.
0xa6a94c356ea0035bc3e2a3cc59f9da9dfd969ddc suddenly he recognised her, crushed and ashamed in her humiliation and gaudy finery, meekly awaiting her turn to say good-bye to her dying father.
0xcd281f1ef0f881c86a2041f29975cf8f0363c02c his face showed intense suffering.
0xd6f3833b1addf11bba11a3b82b20fdb6adc975e4 “sonia!
0x9c85f6ca185e5bcf23a4799e04483a085a135d5c daughter!
0x116f32f9a04c0decc7c95c104f07db7e861c6df0 forgive!”
0x8b236a5496e0065beb9f98f11552769e02208dda he cried, and he tried to hold out his hand to her, but losing his balance, he fell off the sofa, face downwards on the floor.
0xbcf778895f4abdaafcd99cae1f9e500cf5db14b4 they rushed to pick him up, they put him on the sofa; but he was dying.
0x9be0ca27eec79430e459edf063b3c8b3d2d53688 sonia with a faint cry ran up, embraced him and remained so without moving.
0xcf42aed31616b763c12d17e33e774b51468c8ef7 he died in her arms.
0x2b6eafabce4d9dddf07daf635dae866c8bf48222 “he’s got what he wanted,” katerina ivanovna cried, seeing her husband’s dead body.
0x5b7c8ce9fb35096c161a912118698f7d3ca670ef “well, what’s to be done now?
0xe177512d869bc82b5ae6a507df44b4d358f9a5d0 how am i to bury him!
0x78f71169297b3bca87a5108a8ec18cc6643184c9 what can i give them to-morrow to eat?”
0xc6e78ceadb840cd277873d4daef703a946f589af raskolnikov went up to katerina ivanovna.
0x1bcd4b01b922c955723e179da0f766a98e2f3f68 “katerina ivanovna,” he began, “last week your husband told me all his life and circumstances.... believe me, he spoke of you with passionate reverence.
0xefd2943a97c562a822221ba4136cc75332e74bc2 from that evening, when i learnt how devoted he was to you all and how he loved and respected you especially, katerina ivanovna, in spite of his unfortunate weakness, from that evening we became friends.... allow me now... to do something... to repay my debt to my dead friend.
0xb72c47fd45302ef4af9213d79ab3abe3101140bd here are twenty roubles, i think--and if that can be of any assistance to you, then... i... in short, i will come again, i will be sure to come again... i shall, perhaps, come again to-morrow.... good-bye!”
0x67e17de8b559a28b9d6ad81938f0f764d8c9f33d and he went quickly out of the room, squeezing his way through the crowd to the stairs.
0x4fc6c63a0ad5d58736aa41ff1cc107392f0f8081 but in the crowd he suddenly jostled against nikodim fomitch, who had heard of the accident and had come to give instructions in person.
0x7bd1c82b456a752c58ac0fe0e00c0b59adf81b2a they had not met since the scene at the police station, but nikodim fomitch knew him instantly.
0x61b460afb629ae99e8632f2258b4c8b18cbb26da “ah, is that you?”
0x4455e6f2dde1cdca0ff1f81668909e14ae8eee15 he asked him.
0x744e4c2b2c467cd22bcb13c47be5d43cdd4f6533 “he’s dead,” answered raskolnikov.
0x5e8331bf1bc8fb55b6c5d4a4e7feca74c20d319d “the doctor and the priest have been, all as it should have been.
0x59ad852cc33cb72de3a24b9ac5b813cbd573938e don’t worry the poor woman too much, she is in consumption as it is.
0x8d29363dc0e4edafa34fa846552fd5226404253e try and cheer her up, if possible... you are a kind-hearted man, i know...” he added with a smile, looking straight in his face.
0x0366e1cad0b0c30f785fa08b67b2a2b8da49252c “but you are spattered with blood,” observed nikodim fomitch, noticing in the lamplight some fresh stains on raskolnikov’s waistcoat.
0xd1b5fc3753835b5b8bceeab30e66936b2421d7c4 “yes... i’m covered with blood,” raskolnikov said with a peculiar air; then he smiled, nodded and went downstairs.
0x9cc61357100fcf5dce6eb8f27cb93afe8aa5a4a5 he walked down slowly and deliberately, feverish but not conscious of it, entirely absorbed in a new overwhelming sensation of life and strength that surged up suddenly within him.
0x11a013400efb0d69ba628d8c7158471329de5ba1 this sensation might be compared to that of a man condemned to death who has suddenly been pardoned.
0x39213a47f259aba51c06db1e82a6185e6215fba5 halfway down the staircase he was overtaken by the priest on his way home; raskolnikov let him pass, exchanging a silent greeting with him.
0x00aee09223ec0b27b4809d37947123dcd8c5f83f he was just descending the last steps when he heard rapid footsteps behind him.
0xf47a5a509a0055da191a8200f9ff81aa2950456a someone overtook him; it was polenka.
0x92bd97a545ecc7e86f3e337768a0580420c85521 she was running after him, calling “wait!
0x20514d87d75743bb046a3e11b990fb5dbaf502d9 wait!”
0x3c79f43995c4d1d755a8bb3cc6331d862676575d he turned round.
0x803902b366063095489831ebadb1cb0257f2d227 she was at the bottom of the staircase and stopped short a step above him.
0x5a6b09243b9077d76ac66c517b997d4993150f5d a dim light came in from the yard.
0x4dedc3d765e8c08f696f63b44c9b462d76f89575 raskolnikov could distinguish the child’s thin but pretty little face, looking at him with a bright childish smile.
0x8f68e9cd4ac5671a668140b795eda3c49e323092 she had run after him with a message which she was evidently glad to give.
0x6a22758a7843e5650d13c7dc8641848708eeecfa “tell me, what is your name?... and where do you live?”
0xba4fd21a229c2fc06176f7cbdcd2c151979d9a40 she said hurriedly in a breathless voice.
0xe2821a04a54d4705dd4f1afc94c3f2472ed212fb he laid both hands on her shoulders and looked at her with a sort of rapture.
0x90c90d79c89ffb03796e846f56e6f01605b38df4 it was such a joy to him to look at her, he could not have said why.
0x146585aa7f28d5c2a072efe11fd6d0dc529150d3 “who sent you?”
0xb2e72c089e316e0666f9a88259c724b0f657f775 “sister sonia sent me,” answered the girl, smiling still more brightly.
0xe056c23af766fc0441f22421ec5b01ae414e2cde “i knew it was sister sonia sent you.”
0xc4c8ca3a936664a47355b165add0fcc724cb3135 “mamma sent me, too... when sister sonia was sending me, mamma came up, too, and said ‘run fast, polenka.’” “do you love sister sonia?”
0x8a21ee047a0bd55f5fbfaa9c2516df70f9016084 “i love her more than anyone,” polenka answered with a peculiar earnestness, and her smile became graver.
0x21783710af9f2bbd0dc994bd66ec13dfc6b3c6a9 “and will you love me?”
0xc120242644fc6d86e891c3db1a83038ba2ed8e49 by way of answer he saw the little girl’s face approaching him, her full lips naïvely held out to kiss him.
0xa9650d8eeac05ab1cfa1dd3e40682ede13ea4b40 suddenly her arms as thin as sticks held him tightly, her head rested on his shoulder and the little girl wept softly, pressing her face against him.
0x885a32cebcdc8b22f3c216da27fdaa9d3e5ba9e3 “i am sorry for father,” she said a moment later, raising her tear-stained face and brushing away the tears with her hands.
0xa105321513c0d36975eb01ef393c7d5e58f9fe60 “it’s nothing but misfortunes now,” she added suddenly with that peculiarly sedate air which children try hard to assume when they want to speak like grown-up people.
0xef43393b2d870c9004db028aeee870a693a6500a “did your father love you?”
0x1a435d83946b229ecd432bd37a3dc323791fe25d “he loved lida most,” she went on very seriously without a smile, exactly like grown-up people, “he loved her because she is little and because she is ill, too.
0x925e95479f07f4ba40bfa279efc61f423911facd and he always used to bring her presents.
0x44a59dc7f4eeb50e77041eaf2e3711f074a072c8 but he taught us to read and me grammar and scripture, too,” she added with dignity.
0x433bc5e747a8d49e0dbb315fd9bd6c91df89f0dd “and mother never used to say anything, but we knew that she liked it and father knew it, too.
0xe62f9b752dd6cd74f1d739b1da8499342efbde6d and mother wants to teach me french, for it’s time my education began.”
0xf1d2078b0ac022cdd2cf2f0563757a1e38123230 “and do you know your prayers?”
0x2c7b6310cdb7b062abe58b05460724a060e9631e “of course, we do!
0x1450e21c39b2adbe7b2b70dc3c89c7dd9508e8d2 we knew them long ago.
0xc60982bdbbcdfaa0317ccbc9737a0d557c7a126b i say my prayers to myself as i am a big girl now, but kolya and lida say them aloud with mother.
0x32a39065ffc759285bfac4bb7cbda28dbeef382f first they repeat the ‘ave maria’ and then another prayer: ‘lord, forgive and bless sister sonia,’ and then another, ‘lord, forgive and bless our second father.’
0x628749c4a337ff4dac8009da2424198b90a56e2d for our elder father is dead and this is another one, but we do pray for the other as well.”
0x1c6dbc6d0ecfb419ebe8c33e534b366e6b5fe847 “polenka, my name is rodion.
0xb41735b5257d4dd291c0000525167a22014fe518 pray sometimes for me, too.
0x5210e119fa6054b6143dcbf37a1f3bafde477a91 ‘and thy servant rodion,’ nothing more.”
0x471de162d46ef8276628bd9c89dc2a55013e790d “i’ll pray for you all the rest of my life,” the little girl declared hotly, and suddenly smiling again she rushed at him and hugged him warmly once more.
0x1921021e55d710e12f5969e35bd0da393cda7b21 raskolnikov told her his name and address and promised to be sure to come next day.
0x6655222ae754db1450d920a515f2bc580316dab2 the child went away quite enchanted with him.
0x71e3674399b05038b7ec74e417666868da172ee5 it was past ten when he came out into the street.
0xba07eb77cddfe4aaa863ed93614766ecf2407918 in five minutes he was standing on the bridge at the spot where the woman had jumped in.
0x37d8d1d0a520235a8bd3a927bd0cd44fff9116e4 “enough,” he pronounced resolutely and triumphantly.
0x8c9867589af6479f6459fd9b59aeadc549dba4d9 “i’ve done with fancies, imaginary terrors and phantoms!
0xd0563a1c27b37a7d9ee24d981893e081c79dc3e2 life is real!
0x836303907ba9c01fdee0f32c1950a33f75d9a457 haven’t i lived just now?
0x71e758f9e404d3e085307d2737fb80f9b5a11963 my life has not yet died with that old woman!

0x5bfadf3767904f18a5e51ba3a1b0910adacbbef1 we will try our strength!”
0x40b14328ee1e1eb7f4119e5966a94c42226c537d he added defiantly, as though challenging some power of darkness.
0x82bc26decd001681a1e693821181a6b1e0c86629 “and i was ready to consent to live in a square of space!
0xdd7fe8792b497ab8ef0685fdf4f89b1713bb1beb “i am very weak at this moment, but... i believe my illness is all over.
0x2d834047aa751fb081640f4389e5efa42178f4ba i knew it would be over when i went out.
0xabf50dfefef74241650afe54f69518e992b4e628 by the way, potchinkov’s house is only a few steps away.
0xac37c634983536a3b53993b0eccc9b665b85e053 i certainly must go to razumihin even if it were not close by... let him win his bet!

0xc94c81eed8ee38e388cf9da326a6d432f8c46984 strength, strength is what one wants, you can get nothing without it, and strength must be won by strength--that’s what they don’t know,” he added proudly and self-confidently and he walked with flagging footsteps from the bridge.
0x05f7d41d32234d460555034c238bd03aa4fbd354 pride and self-confidence grew continually stronger in him; he was becoming a different man every moment.
0x526ea18dccb5d28c48b7e74fa01d8168db911193 what was it had happened to work this revolution in him?
0xee20673be4101e7b4b8157fba87ae179e0340825 he did not know himself; like a man catching at a straw, he suddenly felt that he, too, ‘could live, that there was still life for him, that his life had not died with the old woman.’
0xe2526f51e61135037aa1b020a8a929335f8fbf15 perhaps he was in too great a hurry with his conclusions, but he did not think of that.
0xbed22e089eca3a3163cf1d28655505ceae314bca “but i did ask her to remember ‘thy servant rodion’ in her prayers,” the idea struck him.
0xa9cec56cf673f5b2395d31cd45e663433d382a32 “well, that was... in case of emergency,” he added and laughed himself at his boyish sally.
0x8b097bd50feac2ecc0b7ac3476f0c5b76fdd74a6 he was in the best of spirits.
0x9756209b54be16633ef73964268d5f4db9b748cc he easily found razumihin; the new lodger was already known at potchinkov’s and the porter at once showed him the way.
0xa6091c0fa97e08a4c3e43ec095f791bee39f9408 half-way upstairs he could hear the noise and animated conversation of a big gathering of people.
0xbc911512085e1b3da48b31b36cfee6429c92e069 the door was wide open on the stairs; he could hear exclamations and discussion.
0x658f23080987ded99b2c3bd17e97ea9a69bcc7d4 razumihin’s room was fairly large; the company consisted of fifteen people.
0xd67d9d18b1f1ec0e7c602803f00e8487a49ad09d raskolnikov stopped in the entry, where two of the landlady’s servants were busy behind a screen with two samovars, bottles, plates and dishes of pie and savouries, brought up from the landlady’s kitchen.
0x60fa66f0240b78709135dddafafab9fef1e03ff5 raskolnikov sent in for razumihin.
0xb6356926d4378b24dc8c25edf1d75676af8b6745 he ran out delighted.
0xd26c3e284e527aacb13a88d97f071a0cfbb0ec35 at the first glance it was apparent that he had had a great deal to drink and, though no amount of liquor made razumihin quite drunk, this time he was perceptibly affected by it.
0x35a43eb55154f11958bd30719a004e0724c290a4 “listen,” raskolnikov hastened to say, “i’ve only just come to tell you you’ve won your bet and that no one really knows what may not happen to him.
0x68acc2bae7c30c07d60ffd44f7dd30f1cbbb9419 i can’t come in; i am so weak that i shall fall down directly.
0x0bcff98da1117e59acdd8f88acf7b02395055193 and so good evening and good-bye!
0x69c536ddf4363f3fef65e9eea7dcd2bb817392af come and see me to-morrow.”
0x76d40604c420383c25bd0d9b618bc945a8cc3380 “do you know what?
0xac15e73f3ad77f45d5e981038c5691633f01b41e i’ll see you home.
0xd257171bdf9fad058e2f069acd00e32902d6f707 if you say you’re weak yourself, you must...” “and your visitors?
0x9f346c3542e6617b0ced2f97f9175f00be6da109 who is the curly-headed one who has just peeped out?”
0x8c4ba2547e703689d19519589cb3ae817f066cc3 “he?
0x8f7f3ec38caf0f63b34f63fc4b3dd41021eb5621 goodness only knows!
0x456ddf154e0e80c732a5c6c87510ea28163799ca some friend of uncle’s, i expect, or perhaps he has come without being invited... i’ll leave uncle with them, he is an invaluable person, pity i can’t introduce you to him now.
0xd7d13e6ea96cc1efac0e08d0d4b214a2c57736d2 but confound them all now!
0x4a7bd6bd97dcef62bc83d609d32fe9368aa1d9cd they won’t notice me, and i need a little fresh air, for you’ve come just in the nick of time--another two minutes and i should have come to blows!
0xff7ff8f6ed90517b7d8a38fb6a5d8d34abebe0db they are talking such a lot of wild stuff... you simply can’t imagine what men will say!
0x05dcf16e08b0e6e07524bab0d9d1ade3f99d11fb though why shouldn’t you imagine?
0x5e0a418a6ce7dbbeb85b6359e4d8b60d8b3174d4 don’t we talk nonsense ourselves?
0x11c0825ffcc79a4d5fa8f7daf928a3ab0019203d and let them... that’s the way to learn not to!... wait a minute, i’ll fetch zossimov.”
0xc7f0b15b4d0fdf56116ce57d0b912018e5fede81 zossimov pounced upon raskolnikov almost greedily; he showed a special interest in him; soon his face brightened.
0xb0efe2ee71e3f979778279c19ef64acaf29c0ed3 “you must go to bed at once,” he pronounced, examining the patient as far as he could, “and take something for the night.
0x074b8694ccff3a629c534e00968bf337582df8bf will you take it?
0x19f4591af9d7edcbfb14b7298f135f3f572be0fb i got it ready some time ago... a powder.”
0x8e0c320d54e597d3aad23a8ef61bba3e2929e250 “two, if you like,” answered raskolnikov.
0xd9d78ebf0a5ce6e78e1c15cc94841c64a8a668a5 the powder was taken at once.
0xc5c4a6888bf972d805a16cb5a92d1129507d5d80 “it’s a good thing you are taking him home,” observed zossimov to razumihin--“we shall see how he is to-morrow, to-day he’s not at all amiss--a considerable change since the afternoon.
0x0578ba4720fbe4d0422a7f4ab5f4bebc0df46e53 live and learn...” “do you know what zossimov whispered to me when we were coming out?”
0x3ad3ef6b1793b5681347ecd6bd2fe97ae83fda57 razumihin blurted out, as soon as they were in the street.
0x18d0ee503acb5de025d5956341dabc553c21974f “i won’t tell you everything, brother, because they are such fools.
0x2b77217479ad071d20bae6c4babf68721b21981e zossimov told me to talk freely to you on the way and get you to talk freely to me, and afterwards i am to tell him about it, for he’s got a notion in his head that you are... mad or close on it.
0xe92630d7c958b8ae642d09a3e6ece0305d58d25b only fancy!
0x6ec7e56c00353b42a26f12047019b40969ee828d in the first place, you’ve three times the brains he has; in the second, if you are not mad, you needn’t care a hang that he has got such a wild idea; and thirdly, that piece of beef whose specialty is surgery has gone mad on mental diseases, and what’s brought him to this conclusion about you was your conversation to-day with zametov.”
0xc716ad27549899cc61da9be23b6a66b8c00ceb6b “zametov told you all about it?”
0x3829e87c71e38a76e0601d23665dfc7a6670f180 “yes, and he did well.
0x980395c412e087188fcf7843160215effed86a80 now i understand what it all means and so does zametov.... well, the fact is, rodya... the point is... i am a little drunk now.... but that’s... no matter... the point is that this idea... you understand?
0xc968b4ffe0b321ed25c01a8bfaa3e0ce529e625a was just being hatched in their brains... you understand?
0x38d1245e41124c40e054d9b01d3e2f53dd628b15 that is, no one ventured to say it aloud, because the idea is too absurd and especially since the arrest of that painter, that bubble’s burst and gone for ever.
0xee7380d68a839c0432cb2aec35147a8600ed51e7 but why are they such fools?
0xceaf9142ddea12e898be9e79cd5e41eb86652afa i gave zametov a bit of a thrashing at the time--that’s between ourselves, brother; please don’t let out a hint that you know of it; i’ve noticed he is a ticklish subject; it was at luise ivanovna’s.
0x3f5aa6fac44bcff02112cdeaaea7b9def41b9711 but to-day, to-day it’s all cleared up.
0x1c162d569f8e31eedcbcad27dc9a6ea463bdae4d that ilya petrovitch is at the bottom of it!
0xdc079cf0e09ac7d81e9414bc84f81897a06638d2 he took advantage of your fainting at the police station, but he is ashamed of it himself now; i know that...” raskolnikov listened greedily.
0x8bb171f034c95800323d02d970e53056187e04d8 razumihin was drunk enough to talk too freely.
0x680d14b74a680a78efeb20a6618597728cd50e81 “i fainted then because it was so close and the smell of paint,” said raskolnikov.
0x84cdcd57318da4169688873e4c526cd59f4c220b “no need to explain that!
0x14b5f765b41820f4778e8ace068dcf4df94b1ba8 and it wasn’t the paint only: the fever had been coming on for a month; zossimov testifies to that!
0x6c7260bfc2a50705227425fc34a1a734577941cb but how crushed that boy is now, you wouldn’t believe!
0xcfa92796c2d37a01b8162d4af0759cfa939d3684 ‘i am not worth his little finger,’ he says.
0x8a83d405f4565e5be64584400eeb917007527cc2 yours, he means.
0x3647a1118d6f7e3841cc093518381888f429b954 he has good feelings at times, brother.
0x34a339e724e2a80823fe3ac9d07bd13f31df8821 but the lesson, the lesson you gave him to-day in the palais de cristal, that was too good for anything!
0xaba095c59a55b0eacf0dcf4b5fd8b39c1bc35883 you frightened him at first, you know, he nearly went into convulsions!
0x419712329ba867792df00dbae49cc84789681852 you almost convinced him again of the truth of all that hideous nonsense, and then you suddenly--put out your tongue at him: ‘there now, what do you make of it?’
0xc713d149e9a5e1f59de98a8fe899e15ddf4c349a it was perfect!
0xcd7c0c0a6ad509a5d68b4e0cfbbc23d1259dd341 he is crushed, annihilated now!
0xf49133289b2008edf85547e4c0fbcc4edb1fcb66 it was masterly, by jove, it’s what they deserve!
0x2c123833fb846775feadfb2a067f8dc1f1ecede7 ah, that i wasn’t there!
0x197d5bcd94affb4d04922e9a5084c4e151160d66 he was hoping to see you awfully.
0x5bae37f294a346e73ef605364848049f252d50c2 porfiry, too, wants to make your acquaintance...” “ah!... he too... but why did they put me down as mad?”
0x0fd789a75f9dc8b48f20a70f9ddc8d90bfcfa79a “oh, not mad.
0x55f42c767a1a7f43a64f71c9f9be67f123cada84 i must have said too much, brother.... what struck him, you see, was that only that subject seemed to interest you; now it’s clear why it did interest you; knowing all the circumstances... and how that irritated you and worked in with your illness... i am a little drunk, brother, only, confound him, he has some idea of his own... i tell you, he’s mad on mental diseases.
0x4132633911a8a9c647f08cfe0123ab886648b86c but don’t you mind him...” for half a minute both were silent.
0xe5e5055c4344e41faff6a4ec2c9d036ae9579a6f “listen, razumihin,” began raskolnikov, “i want to tell you plainly: i’ve just been at a death-bed, a clerk who died... i gave them all my money... and besides i’ve just been kissed by someone who, if i had killed anyone, would just the same... in fact i saw someone else there... with a flame-coloured feather... but i am talking nonsense; i am very weak, support me... we shall be at the stairs directly...” “what’s the matter?
0x08ff84fee653ee7d50082a89443526d576ba6876 what’s the matter with you?”
0xff639f96b978ada8f1f84940b9a36b560999e772 razumihin asked anxiously.
0x695f3f3d3e8db64bba15bb164ccf0b9d832e8165 “i am a little giddy, but that’s not the point, i am so sad, so sad... like a woman.

0xa08b7177ed27b5589b3ca8d5adb3665270aa229c through the crack...” they were already at the foot of the last flight of stairs, at the level of the landlady’s door, and they could, as a fact, see from below that there was a light in raskolnikov’s garret.
0x31b97d32f8c9274f2848e3f04a7ef626fcaa81fe “queer!
0x797b50c01bbaeeddde5fc3076be109c224f1eec1 nastasya, perhaps,” observed razumihin.
0xa7c2092f37c0215367505c63207193879fab8ee9 “she is never in my room at this time and she must be in bed long ago, but... i don’t care!

0x9dd1008505177c60e598e9d07c1b2026ab81333c “what do you mean?

0x56013a432afb3f3aff2a32b53dfe7b4fd32d4708 “i know we are going in together, but i want to shake hands here and say good-bye to you here.

0x7680ebca9f39caa4edbf13733fd2badbee49478d “what’s the matter with you, rodya?”
0x62ac4c74eee2ba63f604138db650b26e077541f0 “nothing... come along... you shall be witness.”
0x3162af13e757dd61b2184013772fe8212d21f27e they began mounting the stairs, and the idea struck razumihin that perhaps zossimov might be right after all.
0x325e55e461f86ee7676116584d413d3ff6fc8556 “ah, i’ve upset him with my chatter!”
0x4580ff4dd2aa1229f288644250cda80c9fad046b he muttered to himself.
0x51ed0c464cbb9f13c80b59798ab141407f6036d3 when they reached the door they heard voices in the room.
0xf7421ecf93fec117c5974f6568bf915fd84f7750 “what is it?”
0x7c4d547aee74a44436715f8c7bf5ee0ca8053140 cried razumihin.
0x86033ec3f0bf5cf40a6d98f6e213e9b0b4d16f71 raskolnikov was the first to open the door; he flung it wide and stood still in the doorway, dumbfoundered.
0x56993d501a3794efd7895ee5b6557c6c60f72b94 his mother and sister were sitting on his sofa and had been waiting an hour and a half for him.
0xa5075af5b46c184d2da8ec768f2b30475de2301c why had he never expected, never thought of them, though the news that they had started, were on their way and would arrive immediately, had been repeated to him only that day?
0x8607b85572d8312a0a9a5372736f08557cc4acdc they had spent that hour and a half plying nastasya with questions.
0xa5befe4d5526a0cd464ceb547a7209cc75c83194 she was standing before them and had told them everything by now.
0xe720f735da9e01e809ece2904753caa2ded1b9fe they were beside themselves with alarm when they heard of his “running away” to-day, ill and, as they understood from her story, delirious!
0x00a665722f43ead8243879ebdc98e1fb7b805270 “good heavens, what had become of him?”
0x8ccb8ed3918d6a4138a84dc4f4a63ede5e3d6341 both had been weeping, both had been in anguish for that hour and a half.
0x3c3c649552c58f4e65cb9d1626678c2449be4100 a cry of joy, of ecstasy, greeted raskolnikov’s entrance.
0x61b4a83f5ef8be849f1989f9cc132516a01b6b9b both rushed to him.
0x4943d7aeccabf10ee91880c2c007c3b0768be317 but he stood like one dead; a sudden intolerable sensation struck him like a thunderbolt.
0xace759cdb1258e850a655fc2e9457632a411da7a he did not lift his arms to embrace them, he could not.
0x3545205a0de6406d7c310dc1fda570cf5ae84540 his mother and sister clasped him in their arms, kissed him, laughed and cried.
0x30694ba5ed9320be5ccc278419668085fb5296a0 he took a step, tottered and fell to the ground, fainting.
0x518dfa81c8d84626a87814343e37d646503bd463 anxiety, cries of horror, moans... razumihin who was standing in the doorway flew into the room, seized the sick man in his strong arms and in a moment had him on the sofa.
0x8296df5403d6351de9a19e82e5a090806c87f0d3 “it’s nothing, nothing!”
0x16f1499257e9e618432290e415c6b29b571da344 he cried to the mother and sister--“it’s only a faint, a mere trifle!
0x4d56f9208d88a7aaa63b182642f9ed60dda69917 only just now the doctor said he was much better, that he is perfectly well!

0xf8c651059592694516d83f2537b64bffc7a2818f and seizing dounia by the arm so that he almost dislocated it, he made her bend down to see that “he is all right again.”
0x4a366b733212f874ed3a6488aab9b8ab504eaf37 the mother and sister looked on him with emotion and gratitude, as their providence.
0x1ba66cdcc1f72e9e6dd19d7bbc335934af8f3e01 they had heard already from nastasya all that had been done for their rodya during his illness, by this “very competent young man,” as pulcheria alexandrovna raskolnikov called him that evening in conversation with dounia.
0xb94dc52c3a7c024609fef232caf3cc2b6cfb591d part iii chapter i raskolnikov got up, and sat down on the sofa.
0x64e3644456638a8c630770782561d17b05c508cc he waved his hand weakly to razumihin to cut short the flow of warm and incoherent consolations he was addressing to his mother and sister, took them both by the hand and for a minute or two gazed from one to the other without speaking.
0x6eb72e899f9d6028c6f791746ee4208e8c3e61b5 his mother was alarmed by his expression.
0x734d2f46be1302e45fd6999bd680421b0ba1365b it revealed an emotion agonisingly poignant, and at the same time something immovable, almost insane.
0x2789a399a06dd059e79cc15d2af4910ef8ffeff9 pulcheria alexandrovna began to cry.
0x9d6c98e12878961ec49444d08dc87af7e5b63f2b avdotya romanovna was pale; her hand trembled in her brother’s.

0x2c85fa5c156865192fe03a61df6952e22943b73e “this evening, rodya,” answered pulcheria alexandrovna, “the train was awfully late.

0x6333329e78b803dfe5ae42928055af70fb01a600 “come, mamma, come out of the room at least for a minute,” dounia whispered in dismay; “we are distressing him, that’s evident.”
0xc74599b82d07187ee734923de6328792bd21c568 “mayn’t i look at him after three years?”
0x7527611b652c7ac19678e26156eef535f0ce6887 wept pulcheria alexandrovna.
0x1d4ee97ca8458c6951bae0dc55d1f3190f4a8ee9 “stay,” he stopped them again, “you keep interrupting me, and my ideas get muddled.... have you seen luzhin?”
0xb7d860e43c1345d48d70c93c34ecd1cfd7df1491 “no, rodya, but he knows already of our arrival.
0xdd1b940678b0b15500806f6f6b3d91f0fa14ccd5 we have heard, rodya, that pyotr petrovitch was so kind as to visit you today,” pulcheria alexandrovna added somewhat timidly.
0x287199db1f7ea0aa71a75acda4b01c3e541b7b08 “yes... he was so kind... dounia, i promised luzhin i’d throw him downstairs and told him to go to hell....” “rodya, what are you saying!
0x528a69354b4005f4d1f49e728e504302d770f0a3 surely, you don’t mean to tell us...” pulcheria alexandrovna began in alarm, but she stopped, looking at dounia.
0xc601b22f40b9532254fb0ca85c874a0ecf8a4d7c avdotya romanovna was looking attentively at her brother, waiting for what would come next.
0x057decbb826e9407b03108f28c7f55a59e082bfc both of them had heard of the quarrel from nastasya, so far as she had succeeded in understanding and reporting it, and were in painful perplexity and suspense.
0xd84345abeedf8a2d8e32fc1e9b5b23be8536809d “dounia,” raskolnikov continued with an effort, “i don’t want that marriage, so at the first opportunity to-morrow you must refuse luzhin, so that we may never hear his name again.”
0x8b92542ba8d8fcb55a78493b250be2e55ce868b8 “good heavens!”
0xfe21f45cad12407fc9e8dd89dfa8187a4d31cb4f cried pulcheria alexandrovna.
0xcc480c0a62d29e7affdf86177fce7cc4f23cc08c “brother, think what you are saying!”
0x3f1771ceff626a4904d65729639d165ac696d1fe avdotya romanovna began impetuously, but immediately checked herself.
0xababe96d4815e279bb284d3eaa9a3a59411ffbe6 “you are not fit to talk now, perhaps; you are tired,” she added gently.
0xed0e298b220f09c5c1332fc4a1029642f952e18c “you think i am delirious?
0xd9242977b4399cfe31b1f18dc70337de0ab52e3c no... you are marrying luzhin for _my_ sake.
0x9efa5e3dfc5dc9615765cb61a1fc8878511be92e but i won’t accept the sacrifice.
0xbbc1f74177a0026f63b00d97b18676d227134f46 and so write a letter before to-morrow, to refuse him... let me read it in the morning and that will be the end of it!”
0x322089a3f768cb07c1a1678128b35f0d6765b256 “that i can’t do!”
0x36e1a89e45ef0f2f2564b0c24aa87ca19a529a0a the girl cried, offended, “what right have you...” “dounia, you are hasty, too, be quiet, to-morrow... don’t you see...” the mother interposed in dismay.
0xe61469b0efca1523ba2f20045af14aa3ca4f3e86 “better come away!”
0xff9361fdab0f2e4c1fd9852f340a1e5bf11b02bf “he is raving,” razumihin cried tipsily, “or how would he dare!
0xb755c046c8ebcd530fdc6329e3408360ab075b63 to-morrow all this nonsense will be over... to-day he certainly did drive him away.
0x9f36c95ae2f8942c30740115434ec121ea31c2ab that was so.
0xf4607fd2a74f33d5f77b00bec81e41345611f907 and luzhin got angry, too.... he made speeches here, wanted to show off his learning and he went out crest-fallen....” “then it’s true?”
0xfe21f45cad12407fc9e8dd89dfa8187a4d31cb4f cried pulcheria alexandrovna.
0x8fa77ca3e9e038cf46185b1753e2c3982931f0e9 “good-bye till to-morrow, brother,” said dounia compassionately--“let us go, mother... good-bye, rodya.”
0x66e803ffdb7c89404afe77cf8c3252dd2e1546fc “do you hear, sister,” he repeated after them, making a last effort, “i am not delirious; this marriage is--an infamy.
0x266cde2f9d63014a22d001399e688701343d780b let me act like a scoundrel, but you mustn’t... one is enough... and though i am a scoundrel, i wouldn’t own such a sister.
0xcef5e3bae8b48a1d7dc44f74758d92236453b75e it’s me or luzhin!
0xe111e4e1344e92b19d33c706e3b5ad7964913eba go now....” “but you’re out of your mind!
0x39cb254bf497fb9a971dc2dcb9f0fe2ae7b4dbb3 despot!”
0xfde0f164ea772ce08348acdbc5f74c839779270d roared razumihin; but raskolnikov did not and perhaps could not answer.
0xd3c8599da38ac363d3a562570aabc0491fbb70ee he lay down on the sofa, and turned to the wall, utterly exhausted.
0x42264e0d12d6b2eac19e59402ecc3bf0a6032a9d avdotya romanovna looked with interest at razumihin; her black eyes flashed; razumihin positively started at her glance.
0xcdc0c7d95dadff802bf09c3a71b1232eb68dc542 pulcheria alexandrovna stood overwhelmed.
0x9aad2329222c0c68b3d72f1bc5dbe93d37f7a6e1 “nothing would induce me to go,” she whispered in despair to razumihin.
0x6445519a5756150d5aa118dfd818b4f3975b58b9 “i will stay somewhere here... escort dounia home.”
0x9bb5571fa3ef7c11661c0f6d6ae32ac4ed99710e “you’ll spoil everything,” razumihin answered in the same whisper, losing patience--“come out on to the stairs, anyway.
0xf2e02be734cd89761d3254cf091ac3ccf4ee8fba nastasya, show a light!
0xef3032ea80ecbbb87bd2f5b0af5a917a91fcc105 i assure you,” he went on in a half whisper on the stairs--“that he was almost beating the doctor and me this afternoon!
0x358ecff058614831827cca0c207c360691d81ab6 do you understand?
0xbb31083355dadefc1756066b7f39cf50bcbdda03 the doctor himself!
0x67c2981628e2330b304419aa027ab3a203309308 even he gave way and left him, so as not to irritate him.
0x70f11ee3011c6eabd09a997c6e5d8472a68b2c9b i remained downstairs on guard, but he dressed at once and slipped off.
0xd1a20f58af335cc3c0f8a3e640eda3110497bfb4 and he will slip off again if you irritate him, at this time of night, and will do himself some mischief....” “what are you saying?”
0xdc86aec7c90d241af57dc0b6bdb63a24694b309b “and avdotya romanovna can’t possibly be left in those lodgings without you.
0x5c184608037911ab13cfc3030a765270d87f3da4 just think where you are staying!
0x4922e8e908f20245fc88f848a5bdd60e91cc99c5 that blackguard pyotr petrovitch couldn’t find you better lodgings... but you know i’ve had a little to drink, and that’s what makes me... swear; don’t mind it....” “but i’ll go to the landlady here,” pulcheria alexandrovna insisted, “i’ll beseech her to find some corner for dounia and me for the night.
0xb9e4364d7074871dc8614e3735d9c41f61d5c2d2 i can’t leave him like that, i cannot!”
0x0a39807ae3f88b545859a084f6ba9a6d2ad85d9f this conversation took place on the landing just before the landlady’s door.
0xb551d2a43728b39946ae99c76ab7d2ebc43fb2bd nastasya lighted them from a step below.
0xe8d8fa89bcad533bd22882d3560a389dddf97291 razumihin was in extraordinary excitement.
0x2c1d13204aca144c2d3d70b7930c08ecb8a4250c half an hour earlier, while he was bringing raskolnikov home, he had indeed talked too freely, but he was aware of it himself, and his head was clear in spite of the vast quantities he had imbibed.
0x5ca0795e4b98a555fe90e3abc3b162ff3976ad90 now he was in a state bordering on ecstasy, and all that he had drunk seemed to fly to his head with redoubled effect.
0xc78553df327eda2a3ecbb175c6f86ca97c75f47a he stood with the two ladies, seizing both by their hands, persuading them, and giving them reasons with astonishing plainness of speech, and at almost every word he uttered, probably to emphasise his arguments, he squeezed their hands painfully as in a vise.
0x6f00cdc8580901bd26171b151657acfa074f6d2e he stared at avdotya romanovna without the least regard for good manners.
0xc40652bf9d2a00604f5d35fa1956bb4c0fe127ad they sometimes pulled their hands out of his huge bony paws, but far from noticing what was the matter, he drew them all the closer to him.
0x2fa7ae74653f0ef92628c686231e7e7429dbc696 if they’d told him to jump head foremost from the staircase, he would have done it without thought or hesitation in their service.
0xbc1400e7dcf75872c14f7ef86baae6c690ebd4f4 though pulcheria alexandrovna felt that the young man was really too eccentric and pinched her hand too much, in her anxiety over her rodya she looked on his presence as providential, and was unwilling to notice all his peculiarities.
0xebe1b072d1cc16ab6cc84fbf1a435ac3379e0c4f but though avdotya romanovna shared her anxiety, and was not of timorous disposition, she could not see the glowing light in his eyes without wonder and almost alarm.
0x1efca1df0f8defd2328de1e571200ba4640ff247 it was only the unbounded confidence inspired by nastasya’s account of her brother’s queer friend, which prevented her from trying to run away from him, and to persuade her mother to do the same.
0xf0c710c6d9c3073eb49aac3fd81be3db70eee940 she realised, too, that even running away was perhaps impossible now.
0x62fe836cabbfa877cf67aed126465d76e30bc319 ten minutes later, however, she was considerably reassured; it was characteristic of razumihin that he showed his true nature at once, whatever mood he might be in, so that people quickly saw the sort of man they had to deal with.
0xb7b286ff4c9c9bc28e38c5df19d729e9797e0855 “you can’t go to the landlady, that’s perfect nonsense!”
0x6be4a61b9ed32ac9464aa8dfb8a9d0a99d485621 he cried.
0x269cda5f214435b20750dd8e4e235f8f9b00e200 “if you stay, though you are his mother, you’ll drive him to a frenzy, and then goodness knows what will happen!
0x8ebf854fd9a997de2bf2daef9fcec5056c51182b listen, i’ll tell you what i’ll do: nastasya will stay with him now, and i’ll conduct you both home, you can’t be in the streets alone; petersburg is an awful place in that way.... but no matter!
0x0a6e667fe6d56f15acbbc28a6db2365d9035fd4c then i’ll run straight back here and a quarter of an hour later, on my word of honour, i’ll bring you news how he is, whether he is asleep, and all that.
0x125766f61d5011f6c94c8cc333e321287e0ae055 then, listen!
0x6e7b9f0926316fb86bee40af741c7e0ebdfb7041 then i’ll run home in a twinkling--i’ve a lot of friends there, all drunk--i’ll fetch zossimov--that’s the doctor who is looking after him, he is there, too, but he is not drunk; he is not drunk, he is never drunk!
0xdf39e5fec5a738453900c4e2576048ee3c458894 i’ll drag him to rodya, and then to you, so that you’ll get two reports in the hour--from the doctor, you understand, from the doctor himself, that’s a very different thing from my account of him!
0x335170730f482f4a5ac84561f0b50da68ae0934e if there’s anything wrong, i swear i’ll bring you here myself, but, if it’s all right, you go to bed.
0xbb3bb4ad10c0832f2c225da8c164f1ac10cbfedf and i’ll spend the night here, in the passage, he won’t hear me, and i’ll tell zossimov to sleep at the landlady’s, to be at hand.
0xd6709ef310c9aa088216eb3e86a50c48165e03cd which is better for him: you or the doctor?
0x7b6fa57f22b2730380d860365e908a790ddc058d so come home then!
0x1191e384a930e3c800e54a49d59b8cd6c39777f7 but the landlady is out of the question; it’s all right for me, but it’s out of the question for you: she wouldn’t take you, for she’s... for she’s a fool... she’d be jealous on my account of avdotya romanovna and of you, too, if you want to know... of avdotya romanovna certainly.
0x4be0b415710e213682a653cfdcaffe1a6dae3ed5 she is an absolutely, absolutely unaccountable character!
0xa86f6618474b13a16f87684578598e0f8dbd1c97 but i am a fool, too!... no matter!

0x3bf8704bafe0099a2e5631a628b65f023fe8e628 do you trust me?
0x55770471963d69619f5c7ada767d3ef3021beaed come, do you trust me or not?”
0x1d81e214f07e07833a64d1482c5d586aad6c7433 “let us go, mother,” said avdotya romanovna, “he will certainly do what he has promised.
0xa5a27173a86bbb302eb268b71e914eb1bc246bf2 he has saved rodya already, and if the doctor really will consent to spend the night here, what could be better?”
0xbd6c4f81914126e144171f5be08055c6cd180c43 “you see, you... you... understand me, because you are an angel!”
0x8b0f2a8deac670b17b8626c4c11ccbab8f34a6d4 razumihin cried in ecstasy, “let us go!
0x2ab195efb1c36660d07b0e3066b26f4917b65db6 nastasya!
0xf8ff218ef173b56a0fb7b344e2ce508d8976103c fly upstairs and sit with him with a light; i’ll come in a quarter of an hour.”
0xfc4c7b0a913d909472d59fedc3675dfcf2c0c9be though pulcheria alexandrovna was not perfectly convinced, she made no further resistance.
0x1211c792627d8d4c7466c6a7ee9af0cec12920b0 razumihin gave an arm to each and drew them down the stairs.
0x41295dd09f1221cc77d8bcb1ac7fb09c4a244463 he still made her uneasy, as though he was competent and good-natured, was he capable of carrying out his promise?
0x9138b74a644187164e0b115760ed1627c72d1ab3 he seemed in such a condition.... “ah, i see you think i am in such a condition!”
0x3a3f2a476d9367dbb004850491a4cba470669a1f razumihin broke in upon her thoughts, guessing them, as he strolled along the pavement with huge steps, so that the two ladies could hardly keep up with him, a fact he did not observe, however.
0xbe1e96968635af07c9f3a2224580c7e37866e8f4 “nonsense!
0x93ebb6389286dd33bbf75dff5d640d1473e0046b that is... i am drunk like a fool, but that’s not it; i am not drunk from wine.

0xb7f852926c0bd6ed904ef78364ec8498d2f8be7b and i expect i shan’t sleep all night... zossimov was afraid a little time ago that he would go mad... that’s why he mustn’t be irritated.”
0x5b6962ea4801e0e1aa9818491bb270c6965355d1 “what do you say?”
0x419a2d4f80d0abf69c9cd9fbada994dbe838b13b cried the mother.
0xa338fe8018d525a053bd263953b9a1630f73950b “did the doctor really say that?”
0x50dbc44c6639184977a027788c350691eefc50e1 asked avdotya romanovna, alarmed.

0xfe68b4a326e53bc6575760c58f18d41cc17ac360 cried razumihin, pressing and shaking the two ladies’ hands.
0xeeea26e84286a8907e00961ff5bd16ef90d53300 “oh, mercy, i do not know,” cried poor pulcheria alexandrovna.
0xc96988d803915223d297d15e8c9e52ccf6197e97 “yes, yes... though i don’t agree with you in everything,” added avdotya romanovna earnestly and at once uttered a cry, for he squeezed her hand so painfully.
0x302360d024278def111e29973e2555d83b25f136 “yes, you say yes... well after that you... you...” he cried in a transport, “you are a fount of goodness, purity, sense... and perfection.

0x709d7d8628104bbcf071841ddf7844522c8e7693 “leave off, i entreat you, what are you doing?”
0x9ca52e35c8533e294b3d8efe23051dda1a2920e0 pulcheria alexandrovna cried, greatly distressed.
0x8721c034c6ed3178cfbf2142291c9b21c31b36ba “get up, get up!”
0x4ce69d948225845c3cd07d355715f119307686ee said dounia laughing, though she, too, was upset.

0x806968b9546aab772405ab0f022212701632166a yes?
0xe5249c10ee8fec61ca250e99282b211266a12fce well, then, i’ll tell you, your _fiancé_ is a scoundrel.”
0x7b0be3eb08036d5c3027ccc193171a764e7991d5 “excuse me, mr. razumihin, you are forgetting...” pulcheria alexandrovna was beginning.
0x7735a45be0bb7c76cf323467be2c03420edf8b68 “yes, yes, you are right, i did forget myself, i am ashamed of it,” razumihin made haste to apologise.
0x955b235dfee35ae221c5b49df281eb7c01648f5b “but... but you can’t be angry with me for speaking so!
0x56150711b586a859e3058a0eab5ad1e83dbac637 for i speak sincerely and not because... hm, hm!
0xda6495df32627d2234d6a3ade08eb89a7abaac49 that would be disgraceful; in fact not because i’m in... hm!
0x5cf97f58ebd58d7d80cca7f1edf109cd0912f19b well, anyway, i won’t say why, i daren’t.... but we all saw to-day when he came in that that man is not of our sort.
0xef3277289acfccef7fa835248f0d79e7209e52eb not because he had his hair curled at the barber’s, not because he was in such a hurry to show his wit, but because he is a spy, a speculator, because he is a skin-flint and a buffoon.
0x75449e96128141e1f3e64c82daba7919f33caa61 that’s evident.
0x11c21266d635c3a192f46ec56650622797f860b7 do you think him clever?
0x6f8037833a8469ad0367e2c1b42d05c7572796dc no, he is a fool, a fool.
0xd0ccef8f5ce37af9025f79d85dc22e56f1bd46d5 and is he a match for you?
0xd2ada9e319d064236af52b349e351cb101549caa good heavens!
0x1ae94e16a6ca494faa63432201f4a2a32600e846 do you see, ladies?”
0xfc424ad2b80446ef69f591d2a3a2d5de8f8a3e08 he stopped suddenly on the way upstairs to their rooms, “though all my friends there are drunk, yet they are all honest, and though we do talk a lot of trash, and i do, too, yet we shall talk our way to the truth at last, for we are on the right path, while pyotr petrovitch... is not on the right path.

0x1edce11599097e31ec2919e1c0ff52c5c65d7eec but enough, it’s all said and forgiven.
0x84d0b008b6ed2e60e1f79e58ee8888e6de010590 is it forgiven?
0xfb6e67c7a582c99d5741f843fb8e4e2606d300fc well, then, let’s go on.

0xdc9991ecd7c36aec8e78c7a9316152e3a04e2089 which number?
0x4969e9e2bbc1797befc6f6a86738066803630cbc eight?
0x8587ce8870909310ed8c51116ddcc7e17d0ed0e5 well, lock yourselves in for the night, then.
0x2954bfb57f27709ed44d832587ebebfd8bd5ec8a don’t let anybody in.
0x7d899bb5f4010b3b8bbe6441738e2ca4c883fed3 in a quarter of an hour i’ll come back with news, and half an hour later i’ll bring zossimov, you’ll see!
0x95851e28da90927512deb72dfdc94f9ee4a7f534 good-bye, i’ll run.”
0x58e9224dbd28326cdf0f7ea09f0c78805147ece1 “good heavens, dounia, what is going to happen?”
0x7cef43341c070d44037437e2e966ad82a5d06d73 said pulcheria alexandrovna, addressing her daughter with anxiety and dismay.
0xfd0d10b1c381d508f93dceaf7ba56c24cb795412 “don’t worry yourself, mother,” said dounia, taking off her hat and cape.
0x887d8c287cd31115fd3c1e2fce079a336af38807 “god has sent this gentleman to our aid, though he has come from a drinking party.
0x8803189575e7cfa8aae301289068967990f8d1b0 we can depend on him, i assure you.
0x236e9383c3579c7c9a50dc6d64f20f440d86d127 and all that he has done for rodya....” “ah.
0xdf3852a78ba02fb0c7bbdd88f5e6a94bb8f26b28 dounia, goodness knows whether he will come!
0x284a5181a8056eb0f4287fae61a7afd5f637fe95 how could i bring myself to leave rodya?... and how different, how different i had fancied our meeting!
0xb5fddd3e833a456e5c364633cc2d6804852281ac how sullen he was, as though not pleased to see us....” tears came into her eyes.
0x1d05d3d880e845a57de7e304a5864fc0ff9aa871 “no, it’s not that, mother.
0x958c9d6529881e32d170a8bac8d0ad9ac9b70d42 you didn’t see, you were crying all the time.
0xcbd61591ae98ad3baaf6e5df9942db962c9b63b9 he is quite unhinged by serious illness--that’s the reason.”
0xcadcb529f7c672630d3d4efb94915043d1a8108f “ah, that illness!
0x588f958227f9be28393e53f2cee95988a05c8b07 what will happen, what will happen?
0x9bbe251238af781584e80f08e0c2345eeae2bf7f and how he talked to you, dounia!”
0x09b51177218290765a2723409592e5fd397223e3 said the mother, looking timidly at her daughter, trying to read her thoughts and, already half consoled by dounia’s standing up for her brother, which meant that she had already forgiven him.
0xcac78ee9628db628abc61a2917d149931832e01e “i am sure he will think better of it to-morrow,” she added, probing her further.
0x856f2398e03bbba4aad660b921f5d21e3397a137 “and i am sure that he will say the same to-morrow... about that,” avdotya romanovna said finally.
0x28a21e0113b65242041aba40bee4860b64ec0d3b and, of course, there was no going beyond that, for this was a point which pulcheria alexandrovna was afraid to discuss.
0x6bb67d66cec0b38c8e54c29adfd4364e6c27e366 dounia went up and kissed her mother.
0xfa822cdd9ec51271be172d12bcf7977cd1d47655 the latter warmly embraced her without speaking.
0x42ea410a3b614b61762085658612e1bcfd64aaae then she sat down to wait anxiously for razumihin’s return, timidly watching her daughter who walked up and down the room with her arms folded, lost in thought.
0x7b9fa79b2cd7c6e34a2f66dd57ecb70841e0d5aa this walking up and down when she was thinking was a habit of avdotya romanovna’s and the mother was always afraid to break in on her daughter’s mood at such moments.
0x9dee3e4333ee85ae8b7f7535bf5095b6cdcfa615 razumihin, of course, was ridiculous in his sudden drunken infatuation for avdotya romanovna.
0x761e200850f36e54dedfd9b09da80e316549fee5 yet apart from his eccentric condition, many people would have thought it justified if they had seen avdotya romanovna, especially at that moment when she was walking to and fro with folded arms, pensive and melancholy.
0x8eeae199be824b3c278d74a556de181ee713ecb9 avdotya romanovna was remarkably good-looking; she was tall, strikingly well-proportioned, strong and self-reliant--the latter quality was apparent in every gesture, though it did not in the least detract from the grace and softness of her movements.
0x7dced6ae6e91d66e808fe20648e33d386b481c64 in face she resembled her brother, but she might be described as really beautiful.
0x33d8df02cd418b4eaa3cc2cc69d6022a589b4f1c her hair was dark brown, a little lighter than her brother’s; there was a proud light in her almost black eyes and yet at times a look of extraordinary kindness.
0x16212954deb1db89e1bc7e997d7cdbf3f4fff566 she was pale, but it was a healthy pallor; her face was radiant with freshness and vigour.
0x5b805ee2d85c031e657510c207a89ed5870f52f2 her mouth was rather small; the full red lower lip projected a little as did her chin; it was the only irregularity in her beautiful face, but it gave it a peculiarly individual and almost haughty expression.
0x61b8a97ec98c9658a95789af1bcc887be365578b her face was always more serious and thoughtful than gay; but how well smiles, how well youthful, lighthearted, irresponsible, laughter suited her face!
0xdf98252af4b97ff37471c22f02ba4bccfdfb28bd it was natural enough that a warm, open, simple-hearted, honest giant like razumihin, who had never seen anyone like her and was not quite sober at the time, should lose his head immediately.
0x0bccbd99741d0f41d9b5b0a57237d82ade28f7fc besides, as chance would have it, he saw dounia for the first time transfigured by her love for her brother and her joy at meeting him.
0xe4fed73cd2a1b44769613a466c168630359ccff1 afterwards he saw her lower lip quiver with indignation at her brother’s insolent, cruel and ungrateful words--and his fate was sealed.
0x6af04738f0e63d080ab2d38fe81529132cd2e490 he had spoken the truth, moreover, when he blurted out in his drunken talk on the stairs that praskovya pavlovna, raskolnikov’s eccentric landlady, would be jealous of pulcheria alexandrovna as well as of avdotya romanovna on his account.
0x6aaf233fb1825e39dbc5a80460af5cf017c5d843 although pulcheria alexandrovna was forty-three, her face still retained traces of her former beauty; she looked much younger than her age, indeed, which is almost always the case with women who retain serenity of spirit, sensitiveness and pure sincere warmth of heart to old age.
0x3942f1f0d44db088229b065f78ad30d4dd3722d4 we may add in parenthesis that to preserve all this is the only means of retaining beauty to old age.
0x35ab270d185c8e6ea0d56634b0c75d5cc53700cd her hair had begun to grow grey and thin, there had long been little crow’s foot wrinkles round her eyes, her cheeks were hollow and sunken from anxiety and grief, and yet it was a handsome face.
0xfee3d4ca06759629c232066e49018d18c0ac7701 she was dounia over again, twenty years older, but without the projecting underlip.
0xf3cdd3cd9bae181efbd724b5f1240f78f851f85e pulcheria alexandrovna was emotional, but not sentimental, timid and yielding, but only to a certain point.
0xec5c218264b7fd4d11b3cca68dfd3fc888e83f13 she could give way and accept a great deal even of what was contrary to her convictions, but there was a certain barrier fixed by honesty, principle and the deepest convictions which nothing would induce her to cross.
0xfe3af15afedffee6ec2356ed5a1afc76ef3ad684 exactly twenty minutes after razumihin’s departure, there came two subdued but hurried knocks at the door: he had come back.
0xeb920e6ac2fcabd083ae3785e10ca1ade78acf6a “i won’t come in, i haven’t time,” he hastened to say when the door was opened.
0x7a3b32f0a80fe62b72afd78c5f58fe92271090b9 “he sleeps like a top, soundly, quietly, and god grant he may sleep ten hours.
0xc477b36554a3a64a3f79c179dcf9deb03d187af6 nastasya’s with him; i told her not to leave till i came.
0x647c1775e64efd5ebfeedd32b25c2e49f60f2d6b now i am fetching zossimov, he will report to you and then you’d better turn in; i can see you are too tired to do anything....” and he ran off down the corridor.
0x54a9bc96ba128df218c0c16e2e2f55dab66ffe4a “what a very competent and... devoted young man!”
0x5ec80fd11008587ca0657a5cefd5c4d3106d8088 cried pulcheria alexandrovna exceedingly delighted.
0x247f68aa267625d4901112a9b485716c2ae04a9c “he seems a splendid person!”
0xa677a28fc6bf36595fd39311989d06417be69bc1 avdotya romanovna replied with some warmth, resuming her walk up and down the room.
0x516bc05ec312c4a7df9536256c0e56e455511442 it was nearly an hour later when they heard footsteps in the corridor and another knock at the door.
0x482498ca264cc731d932d325eb01085c73fef0f7 both women waited this time completely relying on razumihin’s promise; he actually had succeeded in bringing zossimov.
0x688df29e3a9815b8b0ad4d0954086ef4016e583d zossimov had agreed at once to desert the drinking party to go to raskolnikov’s, but he came reluctantly and with the greatest suspicion to see the ladies, mistrusting razumihin in his exhilarated condition.
0xb907a5100e9a02dfe4e293666ccb4e43686547bf but his vanity was at once reassured and flattered; he saw that they were really expecting him as an oracle.
0x19c1c05cc9558380e869f49d653ccc8f31127c60 he stayed just ten minutes and succeeded in completely convincing and comforting pulcheria alexandrovna.
0x2fc99b4b1c83518ad53b136b6aab4c046026d7cd he spoke with marked sympathy, but with the reserve and extreme seriousness of a young doctor at an important consultation.
0x35f2a7688fd739699700dc1e124abe323c3aa612 he did not utter a word on any other subject and did not display the slightest desire to enter into more personal relations with the two ladies.
0x6f2193931d4eea193369be2a90012465dade9a52 remarking at his first entrance the dazzling beauty of avdotya romanovna, he endeavoured not to notice her at all during his visit and addressed himself solely to pulcheria alexandrovna.
0x346b9d2ec337b9fed7c9898719295f14834ca3c4 all this gave him extraordinary inward satisfaction.
0x2c76729dac44d81f1b3476181062160de1b07bcf he declared that he thought the invalid at this moment going on very satisfactorily.
0x266a6426422255e544042727616eb00a40694a84 according to his observations the patient’s illness was due partly to his unfortunate material surroundings during the last few months, but it had partly also a moral origin, “was, so to speak, the product of several material and moral influences, anxieties, apprehensions, troubles, certain ideas... and so on.”
0xe6424260a03c36a8418d7b572ee453f8fcfbc650 noticing stealthily that avdotya romanovna was following his words with close attention, zossimov allowed himself to enlarge on this theme.
0xcab4e7e6946368dc0f7536ba46ba1e04a60b87a8 on pulcheria alexandrovna’s anxiously and timidly inquiring as to “some suspicion of insanity,” he replied with a composed and candid smile that his words had been exaggerated; that certainly the patient had some fixed idea, something approaching a monomania--he, zossimov, was now particularly studying this interesting branch of medicine--but that it must be recollected that until to-day the patient had been in delirium and... and that no doubt the presence of his family would have a favourable effect on his recovery and distract his mind, “if only all fresh shocks can be avoided,” he added significantly.
0x4623d14cec4c3e27d2abe69f9ad36ff060cd67e9 then he got up, took leave with an impressive and affable bow, while blessings, warm gratitude, and entreaties were showered upon him, and avdotya romanovna spontaneously offered her hand to him.
0xbe6659c8cdcc5a61fca034fd86dfa3f82120ada7 he went out exceedingly pleased with his visit and still more so with himself.
0x3232ac957295159bd3502a7414f5c59ea25fe088 “we’ll talk to-morrow; go to bed at once!”
0x10e71f9ab41b5ff15896049015fa04df331b47a0 razumihin said in conclusion, following zossimov out.
0xe88e2c61c855f6b6f403be57d71990d42e0b8c6c “i’ll be with you to-morrow morning as early as possible with my report.”
0x55b98365eae1f376a5034d0c18224ffeccdd82aa “that’s a fetching little girl, avdotya romanovna,” remarked zossimov, almost licking his lips as they both came out into the street.

0xc713783ce5242af4ff71ad2ccdab904c5b683a71 “let me go, you drunken devil,” said zossimov, struggling and when he had let him go, he stared at him and went off into a sudden guffaw.
0x1fa826f3bd3f07bb327e7dc5587d36515d19ab25 razumihin stood facing him in gloomy and earnest reflection.
0x6f6e9b1afc46db2b20e0f8c91ab054c6bcb58e95 “of course, i am an ass,” he observed, sombre as a storm cloud, “but still... you are another.”

0xe9e9eb67c2b4fa7401a5b267e6532d63a387cc1b she will gaze at you and sigh for a whole year together.

0x7481da2f6c908e792b5e975c8a55eae7b8e8a92f but there can’t be....” chapter ii razumihin waked up next morning at eight o’clock, troubled and serious.
0x80f1867f12342a4506c20485fee327ce4ac79fef he found himself confronted with many new and unlooked-for perplexities.
0x59d6ea81e6306396c61b3b8b7292189ec6a64c9d he had never expected that he would ever wake up feeling like that.
0xff430613d762ae2d3a95536a02087e39c6417854 he remembered every detail of the previous day and he knew that a perfectly novel experience had befallen him, that he had received an impression unlike anything he had known before.
0x646538a1f6a4e67f84ec4cbfc4f5a93b917d41bc at the same time he recognised clearly that the dream which had fired his imagination was hopelessly unattainable--so unattainable that he felt positively ashamed of it, and he hastened to pass to the other more practical cares and difficulties bequeathed him by that “thrice accursed yesterday.”
0x03d9b1c1aaa6a73a39a478cc9afde28b638b7757 the most awful recollection of the previous day was the way he had shown himself “base and mean,” not only because he had been drunk, but because he had taken advantage of the young girl’s position to abuse her _fiancé_ in his stupid jealousy, knowing nothing of their mutual relations and obligations and next to nothing of the man himself.
0x83446acaec32d9d8372c0bd38b33b79ef886bf06 and what right had he to criticise him in that hasty and unguarded manner?
0xf178c4affcd2a3df4f2f78a9caae18192ea461cb who had asked for his opinion?
0x065c1beab2e10aba0fa35b60249a2595a7c6de41 was it thinkable that such a creature as avdotya romanovna would be marrying an unworthy man for money?
0x512d59eff81b207fde6f34a006ab1d1343d9b247 so there must be something in him.
0xe7ef425f250b62eb595451d169bc1aac6fb11e25 the lodgings?
0x1c5f0b9fd839a4f2a7d8f541d43f43f93b9b2599 but after all how could he know the character of the lodgings?
0xd8f590f741b71d78fa083bc3c9a51f86308416f0 he was furnishing a flat... foo!
0xad3d3d41d1c0571c9195c0e98c1bc0ef49cdce7f how despicable it all was!
0xbc2fb867beab7e595ba051f63f860bd357646268 and what justification was it that he was drunk?
0x514058a3f04b60629c0cc4ea5a784466a7360769 such a stupid excuse was even more degrading!
0xa61074779dadbf1e6b7da18b1cd419a6fcbcac37 in wine is truth, and the truth had all come out, “that is, all the uncleanness of his coarse and envious heart”!
0x1d30a5a0eac2efbe95cddbd2708bf9620d99d25a and would such a dream ever be permissible to him, razumihin?
0x67670100e285a8f73637411a594b040b28869463 what was he beside such a girl--he, the drunken noisy braggart of last night?
0x8a713264bf41818e7571130a9a81b1a7a4c2f856 was it possible to imagine so absurd and cynical a juxtaposition?
0x4909a7817b264cda5547bb7fcebe2a9c51adaa7f razumihin blushed desperately at the very idea and suddenly the recollection forced itself vividly upon him of how he had said last night on the stairs that the landlady would be jealous of avdotya romanovna... that was simply intolerable.
0x76e73a81c3adac32781f25e46818421bb2099bed he brought his fist down heavily on the kitchen stove, hurt his hand and sent one of the bricks flying.
0x2519f7d99823688ed724a5a0fa064f1170fb778d “of course,” he muttered to himself a minute later with a feeling of self-abasement, “of course, all these infamies can never be wiped out or smoothed over... and so it’s useless even to think of it, and i must go to them in silence and do my duty... in silence, too... and not ask forgiveness, and say nothing... for all is lost now!”
0xc324e5dc5dd5b646ff72437b82eb6eb35bd2d462 and yet as he dressed he examined his attire more carefully than usual.
0xee0d4c5ce229d683fcdab9929cb247d900a69590 he hadn’t another suit--if he had had, perhaps he wouldn’t have put it on.
0xc5262ce1a157d90925e7ed64e9efbd15d64b3ffd “i would have made a point of not putting it on.”
0x4b87fc842a300498637bfbf429352c0fd801fcdb but in any case he could not remain a cynic and a dirty sloven; he had no right to offend the feelings of others, especially when they were in need of his assistance and asking him to see them.
0x13b8ad931f2233a9dc133dc2b8a355f7ce4f7b56 he brushed his clothes carefully.
0xa42045ae7ab613e134252d89f7f7994765b6ca55 his linen was always decent; in that respect he was especially clean.
0x2b4692f2574e13bcbcd05c13bdcdf3b207edaa1e he washed that morning scrupulously--he got some soap from nastasya--he washed his hair, his neck and especially his hands.
0x55b3cb554dcf8dfdc89cab5ca29550fb81af862b when it came to the question whether to shave his stubbly chin or not (praskovya pavlovna had capital razors that had been left by her late husband), the question was angrily answered in the negative.
0xc07d23a9a2746e97ccc62a1e46890cc391f27af2 “let it stay as it is!
0x60f65a39e3379952520d860bf2a022921575e81a what if they think that i shaved on purpose to...? they certainly would think so!
0x21747057253e8a59d46c2c90be5effb19e080d7c not on any account!”
0xf085dc30bfb1dcaa08f7cdddcb60a36e99d3def1 “and... the worst of it was he was so coarse, so dirty, he had the manners of a pothouse; and... and even admitting that he knew he had some of the essentials of a gentleman... what was there in that to be proud of?
0x47438344151f641952a5c1c203ed9d2eed87ca96 everyone ought to be a gentleman and more than that... and all the same (he remembered) he, too, had done little things... not exactly dishonest, and yet.... and what thoughts he sometimes had; hm... and to set all that beside avdotya romanovna!
0x36fcd534b4ae872ba24c92751b6fccc053e46531 confound it!
0x1ccae9d2a058bbe7b500eaf114eec2d90af8b144 so be it!
0x5413d59bf2e8721b02928fe948593b863451c7cd well, he’d make a point then of being dirty, greasy, pothouse in his manners and he wouldn’t care!
0x8a9ec94df446e2102a4b2f184878264ab0f90571 he’d be worse!”
0x4771a6363e94465cfd36d7e8e1df8772f5f96b76 he was engaged in such monologues when zossimov, who had spent the night in praskovya pavlovna’s parlour, came in.
0x2f3088f79ed6af87eaf1c6404d63bdbaab6c2516 he was going home and was in a hurry to look at the invalid first.
0xe3f566548d9df77c578850dd76348f9162e0452f razumihin informed him that raskolnikov was sleeping like a dormouse.
0x69cf676d1ff622ee60598608d69f7fbe8db74ca3 zossimov gave orders that they shouldn’t wake him and promised to see him again about eleven.
0xdd776c611ad9b1e5a210510a26450de6603d78e1 “if he is still at home,” he added.
0x58bb716d83e8a7dc2ad447ea8d5de99a12e76f04 “damn it all!
0x4edd2ddfccb1c768df0661d8f1deb3e8eee32194 if one can’t control one’s patients, how is one to cure them?

0x424139a32855efdd759b72e56e354ea25953f4ef “they are coming, i think,” said razumihin, understanding the object of the question, “and they will discuss their family affairs, no doubt.
0x7adface466e4ddfbf6502b1bb405be77fc1473e2 i’ll be off.
0x97319137a2f464584572d31ba1f91dc764d634c2 you, as the doctor, have more right to be here than i.”
0xa8c860fef0607123824fc3e2cacc8983bf516faf “but i am not a father confessor; i shall come and go away; i’ve plenty to do besides looking after them.”
0x80a8fb2f93d2f39d780ab29c30af498089d38c55 “one thing worries me,” interposed razumihin, frowning.
0x758f6316b7ccfe6293aa645b13b32ed1fa3eacc5 “on the way home i talked a lot of drunken nonsense to him... all sorts of things... and amongst them that you were afraid that he... might become insane.”
0x3791bfd968bcedabb8a2e3ebf73422b80e572dee “you told the ladies so, too.”
0x75ebc027bf131a24eb4e45b030c6fdb89fb390dd “i know it was stupid!

0x9aa4ab23695593dd5129e394542cb7c7515b27da “and porfiry.”
0xd25c52d52daad97c2a4f472a93bf44b3256f17e3 “what does that matter?”
0x82472cf79f3343e10fe8c42c64d8c90b49c3893c “and, by the way, have you any influence on them, his mother and sister?
0xaec69bcfd788f5dbfe158fceaec5f3b3737f8add tell them to be more careful with him to-day....” “they’ll get on all right!”
0x751d9949552268e34d645bd64fde55a982f3d73d razumihin answered reluctantly.
0x7e49c82e9bf4dc73cce820cf2fc63ca223e09e77 “why is he so set against this luzhin?
0x51874add8b829ca43fe165d227be910eeeb2457f a man with money and she doesn’t seem to dislike him... and they haven’t a farthing, i suppose?
0x4298cf3558a3cc31a033e3e9131e8f0cf20f3e6a eh?”
0xfd62eef0eaadbaa839114c4076665c0140b06dab “but what business is it of yours?”
0x1b98c37f3852181645d0814940af53b3d9f7db11 razumihin cried with annoyance.
0x1d9a13d74aa8932cf29bc056514c995640ba1f68 “how can i tell whether they’ve a farthing?
0x00976b4d60e929339bd005378ba25feae2c1da74 ask them yourself and perhaps you’ll find out....” “foo!
0x186bcf4adcfe98901d6cd00d00a298911e88c80d what an ass you are sometimes!
0xfeaed787598614240d786e843a2214a9977a5a4d last night’s wine has not gone off yet.... good-bye; thank your praskovya pavlovna from me for my night’s lodging.
0x767a74c7c9e2a24c212641b3c6749813d3a42de8 she locked herself in, made no reply to my _bonjour_ through the door; she was up at seven o’clock, the samovar was taken into her from the kitchen.
0x4e4d2294a81baf25f5a1bf6b0159e147e23ccc34 i was not vouchsafed a personal interview....” at nine o’clock precisely razumihin reached the lodgings at bakaleyev’s house.
0xabd495b029290a42c915b9438bd65f796ebef0f1 both ladies were waiting for him with nervous impatience.
0xf98eb574b7d77015a1d763ff0d95dfa6bcdc69e5 they had risen at seven o’clock or earlier.
0xa4d0004bf1a423f9c38eeb240e46a2bf9fa72d7a he entered looking as black as night, bowed awkwardly and was at once furious with himself for it.
0x51b34978cb5e66d4f3e5ce9a07ffdbd4a6d3fc08 he had reckoned without his host: pulcheria alexandrovna fairly rushed at him, seized him by both hands and was almost kissing them.
0x879b7ce28ba119e1d970e8913b6a57cf503f57de he glanced timidly at avdotya romanovna, but her proud countenance wore at that moment an expression of such gratitude and friendliness, such complete and unlooked-for respect (in place of the sneering looks and ill-disguised contempt he had expected), that it threw him into greater confusion than if he had been met with abuse.
0xbbcc12d080a121ac0ab68d0b1907bdde62479de3 fortunately there was a subject for conversation, and he made haste to snatch at it.
0x76154cd141ed89075ddf817316304711d513afb0 hearing that everything was going well and that rodya had not yet waked, pulcheria alexandrovna declared that she was glad to hear it, because “she had something which it was very, very necessary to talk over beforehand.”
0x6e251b5a84676aeeaa93f9e567933da571927f7e then followed an inquiry about breakfast and an invitation to have it with them; they had waited to have it with him.
0xa3fd5c8ff8941a316b835f7edc9a4df7633951b6 avdotya romanovna rang the bell: it was answered by a ragged dirty waiter, and they asked him to bring tea which was served at last, but in such a dirty and disorderly way that the ladies were ashamed.
0x06f6c2b62c8ac036b50a4aeb82483415597cd088 razumihin vigorously attacked the lodgings, but, remembering luzhin, stopped in embarrassment and was greatly relieved by pulcheria alexandrovna’s questions, which showered in a continual stream upon him.
0x33268948e8994788a7380b549c71b74087e501c2 he talked for three quarters of an hour, being constantly interrupted by their questions, and succeeded in describing to them all the most important facts he knew of the last year of raskolnikov’s life, concluding with a circumstantial account of his illness.
0x029ed847af4b390649f6e70dbd46114a6a3d7206 he omitted, however, many things, which were better omitted, including the scene at the police station with all its consequences.
0xdf92f173514864a500c30ac95a93a158d16d3682 they listened eagerly to his story, and, when he thought he had finished and satisfied his listeners, he found that they considered he had hardly begun.
0x977901fb4258d8af6f94ffcb643cb843addb882c “tell me, tell me!
0x5888785699b88f32c8e01c12dfede15c1ead226c what do you think...? excuse me, i still don’t know your name!”
0x8c73441a0c026e4e9d723c0fa091282de81d4890 pulcheria alexandrovna put in hastily.
0xdc38a5ecec4dd5e3627c508bd0523177235d5f86 “dmitri prokofitch.”
0x61043e9edecf0a4a3a74305c20b4fc67f3bea4ea “i should like very, very much to know, dmitri prokofitch... how he looks... on things in general now, that is, how can i explain, what are his likes and dislikes?
0xf79c43a945941305f59663d3fd7110f8593bfd7f is he always so irritable?
0x6c1d8b42a998f164377914834b9d943b56575554 tell me, if you can, what are his hopes and, so to say, his dreams?
0x80df77df6d6aa61a1c7647883c41527fbe70c128 under what influences is he now?
0x073343915f4ec42fbd251880a4929586fda85895 in a word, i should like...” “ah, mother, how can he answer all that at once?”
0x67f0b16d5b5272fdca65e805a2d10ab993148b50 observed dounia.
0xc5abf6c92924a51697e6374f27fab877756b7fc1 “good heavens, i had not expected to find him in the least like this, dmitri prokofitch!”
0x5d2ffcf4f3ddc09f89e85945abbafb6690ce4e5c “naturally,” answered razumihin.
0xba771ff50014bef0a9918ff5da7f30c3a8c7d8e9 “i have no mother, but my uncle comes every year and almost every time he can scarcely recognise me, even in appearance, though he is a clever man; and your three years’ separation means a great deal.
0xe0c8f32648c4605db7fcc780c92a8d89a319c97b what am i to tell you?
0x6e994d213581d771c80277b2b9e40e445e55a291 i have known rodion for a year and a half; he is morose, gloomy, proud and haughty, and of late--and perhaps for a long time before--he has been suspicious and fanciful.
0x96a3c67cc6c650e43a4f52952cc219a2f8056215 he has a noble nature and a kind heart.
0x1736eb6c7193f429a32632567a3c4e7114953c4c he does not like showing his feelings and would rather do a cruel thing than open his heart freely.
0xc2aedceb9e0a98e8d736380761db974034f27c44 sometimes, though, he is not at all morbid, but simply cold and inhumanly callous; it’s as though he were alternating between two characters.
0x9808707afe574987b43f589f94177a34c737a309 sometimes he is fearfully reserved!
0x8d8bb6204f1f7c203003ad27ae691d278fed5988 he says he is so busy that everything is a hindrance, and yet he lies in bed doing nothing.
0x523a288d3c281c348a09584e74e57e01a593a9ab he doesn’t jeer at things, not because he hasn’t the wit, but as though he hadn’t time to waste on such trifles.
0xe242772dffbba0a25dcdc1afb5f97bfd0cad4714 he never listens to what is said to him.
0xbdc615a5fccd95e81800d9f6ce7d00647e7bbff1 he is never interested in what interests other people at any given moment.
0x52c32a81e02a4b588568c64c8f4f742ed9f3eb20 he thinks very highly of himself and perhaps he is right.
0xefa0c61b3df74b9bd885c568301440f2e8810c15 well, what more?
0x830b3367da4ff96d7b5e7d9f6e2baf96454120d3 i think your arrival will have a most beneficial influence upon him.”
0xbad3708c692de64d68d1c49e7f0f6fadb6672382 “god grant it may,” cried pulcheria alexandrovna, distressed by razumihin’s account of her rodya.
0xb18dafb53c92578d4b0fc3313029e0935a11df23 and razumihin ventured to look more boldly at avdotya romanovna at last.
0x35714f35b9dd1233715e2e90faf58f1b874eba96 he glanced at her often while he was talking, but only for a moment and looked away again at once.
0xd9478bbef4ccd4da40482631198183757d2f67d9 avdotya romanovna sat at the table, listening attentively, then got up again and began walking to and fro with her arms folded and her lips compressed, occasionally putting in a question, without stopping her walk.
0xf6edada96f7c77061e429e2eb57b07b0352f5a8d she had the same habit of not listening to what was said.
0xc0cd6408f393a0ed36ec719688c2f94b1fd9b656 she was wearing a dress of thin dark stuff and she had a white transparent scarf round her neck.
0xc6a6e263ebaddf34852c0024d0c47ccad0f02237 razumihin soon detected signs of extreme poverty in their belongings.
0xfa709041a9c9f9a1600cdaa1178a6656c6ab6fea had avdotya romanovna been dressed like a queen, he felt that he would not be afraid of her, but perhaps just because she was poorly dressed and that he noticed all the misery of her surroundings, his heart was filled with dread and he began to be afraid of every word he uttered, every gesture he made, which was very trying for a man who already felt diffident.
0x62819338ce4faa2a2c555b1c8ad77d83f50879a8 “you’ve told us a great deal that is interesting about my brother’s character... and have told it impartially.
0xa11690f6e4f9d2baee8affb4530088331d63e560 i am glad.
0x53eda9823fb0a7cb3d75be3da206f9bb947263a2 i thought that you were too uncritically devoted to him,” observed avdotya romanovna with a smile.
0x3b9916dbd2f6415fd259f0f1dbe9623247cf973f “i think you are right that he needs a woman’s care,” she added thoughtfully.
0x472d0e3d821136aabe39b52918e6079e4025e612 “i didn’t say so; but i daresay you are right, only...” “what?”
0xb83467ccb2d471e7788470e57c048ee223e7867d “he loves no one and perhaps he never will,” razumihin declared decisively.
0xd34d914f2ad66a5604b67b2ddf174758df0fb23d “you mean he is not capable of love?”
0x82939938d38f994211ece783a103994148da6908 “do you know, avdotya romanovna, you are awfully like your brother, in everything, indeed!”
0x32bef5be859a56e2606e0b45b64288240b736d1f he blurted out suddenly to his own surprise, but remembering at once what he had just before said of her brother, he turned as red as a crab and was overcome with confusion.
0xe69cfa39fd4876188837b1faeecb386a3d36b29b avdotya romanovna couldn’t help laughing when she looked at him.
0x5a58e443507150e0a0a3e9d5b973efe8e1ea4357 “you may both be mistaken about rodya,” pulcheria alexandrovna remarked, slightly piqued.
0x3c3a3a047ae74007aa3df082a1fbae8b0dcd7e6f “i am not talking of our present difficulty, dounia.
0xd09afd414ee41074e752319553881e5a10fa5bfe what pyotr petrovitch writes in this letter and what you and i have supposed may be mistaken, but you can’t imagine, dmitri prokofitch, how moody and, so to say, capricious he is.
0xb130a7bd0e47b1c9ef2ff216574007bf57d84cc1 i never could depend on what he would do when he was only fifteen.
0xc8e350b599b6b14617e4bde18be9d4a125181d2c and i am sure that he might do something now that nobody else would think of doing... well, for instance, do you know how a year and a half ago he astounded me and gave me a shock that nearly killed me, when he had the idea of marrying that girl--what was her name--his landlady’s daughter?”
0xc87c459cdb5512db916e2152b32dec4a5bd55069 “did you hear about that affair?”
0x11a73adbac58bce60eed3eb8179ee5cc45587dc6 asked avdotya romanovna.
0x0be82cac04d60d69eb1912f4c8ccb45d728c290c “do you suppose----” pulcheria alexandrovna continued warmly.
0x6f188afcef0752d7e6b12ca46e01f3e17b307b5b “do you suppose that my tears, my entreaties, my illness, my possible death from grief, our poverty would have made him pause?
0xac1b7d0fe16f8a28960fcae2ca8a6b48545c5171 no, he would calmly have disregarded all obstacles.
0xa6af9b8d5570a6e3151974ccb1de8bd0313ded4b and yet it isn’t that he doesn’t love us!”
0xee2ed28ed5e4e528d7546c735c62713bb2b2d52e “he has never spoken a word of that affair to me,” razumihin answered cautiously.
0xdc5049e98740c3f6e11a283f2d1cbd5ce73976ea “but i did hear something from praskovya pavlovna herself, though she is by no means a gossip.
0xa20972f1f114c1280b856a2e54662a24ecf1f5d4 and what i heard certainly was rather strange.”
0x2adf3870e6ae225c87f28d0f8654a5e40f7396a0 “and what did you hear?”
0x559bad928f4f2b438ab3894f2e7a6dd015437f24 both the ladies asked at once.
0x90281fba1d4908726ee655e341372620eb6c4247 “well, nothing very special.
0xe9a0dbede3bfd9d95201b84483199cab049d84d6 i only learned that the marriage, which only failed to take place through the girl’s death, was not at all to praskovya pavlovna’s liking.
0xe31a526a1543ec675165c6a6b78eea7cde2c1842 they say, too, the girl was not at all pretty, in fact i am told positively ugly... and such an invalid... and queer.
0x01b660ab7f648ddde8ae35c4cf3f3c061cec81cd but she seems to have had some good qualities.
0x021c7cd2ca563c9e9579517a5100f1190a00a0ef she must have had some good qualities or it’s quite inexplicable.... she had no money either and he wouldn’t have considered her money.... but it’s always difficult to judge in such matters.”
0xb7e859cdbe73c19674d2179f0e3dcc329645307b “i am sure she was a good girl,” avdotya romanovna observed briefly.
0x49e884a07d4ea72f700f5f44cd114095a7a7791b “god forgive me, i simply rejoiced at her death.
0x3e1345e4f6a750172293287b6bc489b6a33037d8 though i don’t know which of them would have caused most misery to the other--he to her or she to him,” pulcheria alexandrovna concluded.
0xf487ef6b3b759f4186cfa9ae54cd93d95e7250cb then she began tentatively questioning him about the scene on the previous day with luzhin, hesitating and continually glancing at dounia, obviously to the latter’s annoyance.
0x34ba3c103d4a64aae3292c0e2f898e50c4f66a33 this incident more than all the rest evidently caused her uneasiness, even consternation.
0xcb9df6b622f2057b6e1f26f6b34c73d09f4ad17d razumihin described it in detail again, but this time he added his own conclusions: he openly blamed raskolnikov for intentionally insulting pyotr petrovitch, not seeking to excuse him on the score of his illness.
0xb5ab8284f2108bf4c2e563013763952a86c22af8 “he had planned it before his illness,” he added.
0x253fdc4f91660bc5cb84b324d63f7e95d740b056 “i think so, too,” pulcheria alexandrovna agreed with a dejected air.
0x74a2533c193081494508bf6b31154bf144e1c33b but she was very much surprised at hearing razumihin express himself so carefully and even with a certain respect about pyotr petrovitch.
0x2c3925f75572cd1ed6b0ce3803ba6c81ac1ee0ff avdotya romanovna, too, was struck by it.
0x736776885f9757aaba7d5abdcc1f14065df9dc77 “so this is your opinion of pyotr petrovitch?”
0x9e304300c8ef73df75feaf6f5fb7a79d17eb631a pulcheria alexandrovna could not resist asking.
0x7638c4d595e53311ae3966dc2b671367492ce182 “i can have no other opinion of your daughter’s future husband,” razumihin answered firmly and with warmth, “and i don’t say it simply from vulgar politeness, but because... simply because avdotya romanovna has of her own free will deigned to accept this man.
0xfa6e7e3ceaa5ded2689477c2f80d36cc6ed5a9bf if i spoke so rudely of him last night, it was because i was disgustingly drunk and... mad besides; yes, mad, crazy, i lost my head completely... and this morning i am ashamed of it.”
0xc19625f2c882d709450f43f824b45690a681f19f he crimsoned and ceased speaking.
0xf48ad67e2fb661a28f2db2fee15062a6130172c2 avdotya romanovna flushed, but did not break the silence.
0xe421a486a477a171d2a4d93c668d32b95c6a9afe she had not uttered a word from the moment they began to speak of luzhin.
0x0c451caec084e47281933f5e20cd0e2c719c84ba without her support pulcheria alexandrovna obviously did not know what to do.
0xa1af03ac8c6ea72cbc1dd5b286f787e3596795bb at last, faltering and continually glancing at her daughter, she confessed that she was exceedingly worried by one circumstance.
0x1c4034f728065fd496ecf34a2ed170a45810cff8 “you see, dmitri prokofitch,” she began.
0xbdec194c142fa2507b7fdc745ef417b69d616015 “i’ll be perfectly open with dmitri prokofitch, dounia?”
0x5cb086fb59b02cb9ebf28c29481eed63cb27555b “of course, mother,” said avdotya romanovna emphatically.
0x9084b59e8ca2a3e459d09621c19bd2dda09ffed0 “this is what it is,” she began in haste, as though the permission to speak of her trouble lifted a weight off her mind.
0x6371811388e8ca82fba442f487855b51790f793a “very early this morning we got a note from pyotr petrovitch in reply to our letter announcing our arrival.
0x9e222db9a7d5c6dcb66479f884b65c6af73c4fff he promised to meet us at the station, you know; instead of that he sent a servant to bring us the address of these lodgings and to show us the way; and he sent a message that he would be here himself this morning.
0xb2506d7cdcf581b24c5937d45d33b19fccc1e20a but this morning this note came from him.
0x7f037f5ee20a22d73640d1623a9aea94383fbed2 you’d better read it yourself; there is one point in it which worries me very much... you will soon see what that is, and... tell me your candid opinion, dmitri prokofitch!
0x0812c51cf81cbdc20bb37e593909a4c7d012816e you know rodya’s character better than anyone and no one can advise us better than you can.
0x73023eb7b0413ded5d805b11670493da70461d63 dounia, i must tell you, made her decision at once, but i still don’t feel sure how to act and i... i’ve been waiting for your opinion.”
0xcf476538d5faef8b69ee5e6589ee19000d1284c8 razumihin opened the note which was dated the previous evening and read as follows: “dear madam, pulcheria alexandrovna, i have the honour to inform you that owing to unforeseen obstacles i was rendered unable to meet you at the railway station; i sent a very competent person with the same object in view.
0xaede457e4276398db7025282f65a9686770fd3cc i likewise shall be deprived of the honour of an interview with you to-morrow morning by business in the senate that does not admit of delay, and also that i may not intrude on your family circle while you are meeting your son, and avdotya romanovna her brother.
0xc27fcd4296a0b90058dd79680a5c34c257223057 i shall have the honour of visiting you and paying you my respects at your lodgings not later than to-morrow evening at eight o’clock precisely, and herewith i venture to present my earnest and, i may add, imperative request that rodion romanovitch may not be present at our interview--as he offered me a gross and unprecedented affront on the occasion of my visit to him in his illness yesterday, and, moreover, since i desire from you personally an indispensable and circumstantial explanation upon a certain point, in regard to which i wish to learn your own interpretation.
0x05255e8558d8583c41241d872b4ddbb5a44978e0 i have the honour to inform you, in anticipation, that if, in spite of my request, i meet rodion romanovitch, i shall be compelled to withdraw immediately and then you have only yourself to blame.
0x7b7f31759c565891900fe715c072d35bf4eb8ad3 i write on the assumption that rodion romanovitch who appeared so ill at my visit, suddenly recovered two hours later and so, being able to leave the house, may visit you also.
0x2d03fd2544e066d4e77d73fd45d596815435c52b i was confirmed in that belief by the testimony of my own eyes in the lodging of a drunken man who was run over and has since died, to whose daughter, a young woman of notorious behaviour, he gave twenty-five roubles on the pretext of the funeral, which gravely surprised me knowing what pains you were at to raise that sum.
0x93caf2f83c858e0e73efa3809e1f9d44b67e7660 herewith expressing my special respect to your estimable daughter, avdotya romanovna, i beg you to accept the respectful homage of “your humble servant, “p.

0x592aa1c3a85be977254504e39082db55b004ca07 “what am i to do now, dmitri prokofitch?”
0xed746627107fe5de7c30c57b10b9d2b1ca730736 began pulcheria alexandrovna, almost weeping.
0x11f34a76fece3598b05c51698e96b40c2f76ca32 “how can i ask rodya not to come?
0x8a9a9d6aff3d778f6cf9f889808ef55f48b8f90b yesterday he insisted so earnestly on our refusing pyotr petrovitch and now we are ordered not to receive rodya!
0x1ec2e7d889e0196bd922c6ac66d9cb4968eef239 he will come on purpose if he knows, and... what will happen then?”
0xcaa4981e4f5b3dd671521b7b28c7640f217e5caf “act on avdotya romanovna’s decision,” razumihin answered calmly at once.
0x4af4cec4d2aa55272aa07c989445b7ab1d22f82c “oh, dear me!
0x3713a23fbb45e800da8d0cf982158599725c5b1f she says... goodness knows what she says, she doesn’t explain her object!
0x03b71c2ee38f8afbee24feee8d1158424ec3acd0 she says that it would be best, at least, not that it would be best, but that it’s absolutely necessary that rodya should make a point of being here at eight o’clock and that they must meet.... i didn’t want even to show him the letter, but to prevent him from coming by some stratagem with your help... because he is so irritable.... besides i don’t understand about that drunkard who died and that daughter, and how he could have given the daughter all the money... which...” “which cost you such sacrifice, mother,” put in avdotya romanovna.
0xb1fd2cebd1abc8765ea1b4eb23d2868d1c63469b “he was not himself yesterday,” razumihin said thoughtfully, “if you only knew what he was up to in a restaurant yesterday, though there was sense in it too.... hm!
0x50657b2db1d68379c478f73e995930a87b7badbc he did say something, as we were going home yesterday evening, about a dead man and a girl, but i didn’t understand a word.... but last night, i myself...” “the best thing, mother, will be for us to go to him ourselves and there i assure you we shall see at once what’s to be done.
0x0fbfe6e013a12cf3322db2f04d8ef56937efdc3d besides, it’s getting late--good heavens, it’s past ten,” she cried looking at a splendid gold enamelled watch which hung round her neck on a thin venetian chain, and looked entirely out of keeping with the rest of her dress.
0x8ada2c799eb74a2f232b8517e80774a55f802eb8 “a present from her _fiancé_,” thought razumihin.
0x1388c5f2b4cbcc3ef73e5ff857c4221d6f2691f6 “we must start, dounia, we must start,” her mother cried in a flutter.
0xc61fe12d98af64f0fef1f32f6723e192c26d7261 “he will be thinking we are still angry after yesterday, from our coming so late.
0x0dde0372104ce8f4fd45ca10f0704321c2be0036 merciful heavens!”
0x921efa0578b2baf5016a6ded8c5eaab553b2c475 while she said this she was hurriedly putting on her hat and mantle; dounia, too, put on her things.
0x3716296e786baa08984dfb932994747101a77a1d her gloves, as razumihin noticed, were not merely shabby but had holes in them, and yet this evident poverty gave the two ladies an air of special dignity, which is always found in people who know how to wear poor clothes.
0x19bc5a5a1fff782f2847fb5c8f3fc1070d38935d razumihin looked reverently at dounia and felt proud of escorting her.
0xaac84ec2260408cfd3b9b781f2784ed5036ab59b “the queen who mended her stockings in prison,” he thought, “must have looked then every inch a queen and even more a queen than at sumptuous banquets and levées.”
0xdddbe29fef7e12088a8fa6f2c39ec51cba65cba7 “my god!”
0xc868c8ea5d9d295fb7821a8a13e25b09bc63ee41 exclaimed pulcheria alexandrovna, “little did i think that i should ever fear seeing my son, my darling, darling rodya!
0x60c94a275813fec8915ab6aa77d041d46cb0d0f4 i am afraid, dmitri prokofitch,” she added, glancing at him timidly.
0x3ab7ad3b8d0776fe299ad747318ea1cfdc6b3af9 “don’t be afraid, mother,” said dounia, kissing her, “better have faith in him.”
0xbfb5c2a905a7e067b02f7b4356599dfae4b8491b “oh, dear, i have faith in him, but i haven’t slept all night,” exclaimed the poor woman.
0xff3e0218f73dfa56c9f288e5b78e44677eb3f05f they came out into the street.
0x2907c7b2ca1174e790445f00f6eb5c16f0f2ef9e “do you know, dounia, when i dozed a little this morning i dreamed of marfa petrovna... she was all in white... she came up to me, took my hand, and shook her head at me, but so sternly as though she were blaming me.... is that a good omen?
0x47f417146d99ca056c966b62d30c433732b8ec10 oh, dear me!
0x8b10b7a1fcda6a80ce1f3c9b168b28f769136d96 you don’t know, dmitri prokofitch, that marfa petrovna’s dead!”
0xf0b360fe4bf4eb7d3a6acaefbe77adc1483ef05d “no, i didn’t know; who is marfa petrovna?”
0xbe480cbcc3a5efa92d6d5af9f526e227319ba93b “she died suddenly; and only fancy...” “afterwards, mamma,” put in dounia.
0xac60367c96d1124796cfe260669837c338f2d300 “he doesn’t know who marfa petrovna is.”
0xb5a0300725cb208a840242f90a7a5a3febd95b8e “ah, you don’t know?
0xd9a111fa62c9e629c8cdd7cd37ac5714098e9a0a and i was thinking that you knew all about us.
0x9a0f5f6d83fb49931dbcf4fcc70a9eec9890ce8d forgive me, dmitri prokofitch, i don’t know what i am thinking about these last few days.
0xa9758e287a04985b45dedb19c440e227a065b2f4 i look upon you really as a providence for us, and so i took it for granted that you knew all about us.
0x51d8c42c9feabec2a88ed3ea118d7aed7a5ecae7 i look on you as a relation.... don’t be angry with me for saying so.
0xaad29c447588c97259c45a2b462c0f5f260019b1 dear me, what’s the matter with your right hand?
0x8e5ab311826fec38751fad180f9841ab9e8e74b5 have you knocked it?”
0xeea773956f6a700a6b7bd3a4f31d08327f67ada6 “yes, i bruised it,” muttered razumihin overjoyed.
0xdb32657a6a4ae1b7aec11d809cc08ab972607bd2 “i sometimes speak too much from the heart, so that dounia finds fault with me.... but, dear me, what a cupboard he lives in!
0x02824b4b2aaa4dc392ec6de490985b375d6017ce i wonder whether he is awake?
0x4936bde9eca74a0fa01152fa4d903a546a32c572 does this woman, his landlady, consider it a room?
0x5c090db5c624334f97bfddbd7dba6764ebdaa950 listen, you say he does not like to show his feelings, so perhaps i shall annoy him with my... weaknesses?
0x3f4c2cbd06b3ba87575e2bbb62ba12e67a1db3b8 do advise me, dmitri prokofitch, how am i to treat him?
0x371080fad3868b1e346277d938b01294da9cf028 i feel quite distracted, you know.”
0xf559ad44149290b8a10c4bc7597d331d8554474d “don’t question him too much about anything if you see him frown; don’t ask him too much about his health; he doesn’t like that.”
0x03f391891d2260f152d55d89c2262e1664321484 “ah, dmitri prokofitch, how hard it is to be a mother!
0xfccf0b6d3d71994dcf32a4fdd798faafff67d7f3 but here are the stairs.... what an awful staircase!”
0xea8c8ef27ec90e65121ec48e28855e5a44611d8d “mother, you are quite pale, don’t distress yourself, darling,” said dounia caressing her, then with flashing eyes she added: “he ought to be happy at seeing you, and you are tormenting yourself so.”
0x4fd38dd05c2bd677349290f5067ea0019173bd2e “wait, i’ll peep in and see whether he has waked up.”
0xceb8fa4e2930c9270cc327b97c68bbd940e81d08 the ladies slowly followed razumihin, who went on before, and when they reached the landlady’s door on the fourth storey, they noticed that her door was a tiny crack open and that two keen black eyes were watching them from the darkness within.
0x7c0db17e5503bcd6a77d149560ec5d0f53cc37f2 when their eyes met, the door was suddenly shut with such a slam that pulcheria alexandrovna almost cried out.
0x61b2c3f5105ccc016aff79137180979acdb3201c chapter iii “he is well, quite well!”
0xdecec3d59eabf126cd40e787049092675c620390 zossimov cried cheerfully as they entered.
0xc56b866fff2ed232c5ebab3b8ca318c5420e54ed he had come in ten minutes earlier and was sitting in the same place as before, on the sofa.
0x2cecf3183f501765b3cbc87a6ded3518eccb408d raskolnikov was sitting in the opposite corner, fully dressed and carefully washed and combed, as he had not been for some time past.
0xd033ce906af6f1a4f78907a4a68cbe5a2510f927 the room was immediately crowded, yet nastasya managed to follow the visitors in and stayed to listen.
0x880d498b33b9347390a6904293fc227c331eb09e raskolnikov really was almost well, as compared with his condition the day before, but he was still pale, listless, and sombre.
0xfa0074f95e27a1321ba8064d5858c62cf6ecda69 he looked like a wounded man or one who has undergone some terrible physical suffering.
0x4a62b653a862254912b756ad58f1870c01467175 his brows were knitted, his lips compressed, his eyes feverish.
0xa33d86eaaf432ed6ff5d5726c872f798c0508e37 he spoke little and reluctantly, as though performing a duty, and there was a restlessness in his movements.
0x5c1319c2f8c61c9c528137a90536c7faa1fed563 he only wanted a sling on his arm or a bandage on his finger to complete the impression of a man with a painful abscess or a broken arm.
0x1555d0d66c975617960d3b64cc83578976bc6a84 the pale, sombre face lighted up for a moment when his mother and sister entered, but this only gave it a look of more intense suffering, in place of its listless dejection.
0x7edb2792bd8151476df3ca5ad7f9252b310f8b88 the light soon died away, but the look of suffering remained, and zossimov, watching and studying his patient with all the zest of a young doctor beginning to practise, noticed in him no joy at the arrival of his mother and sister, but a sort of bitter, hidden determination to bear another hour or two of inevitable torture.
0xe505a1499a5d693574a45d510f37b63feb497e94 he saw later that almost every word of the following conversation seemed to touch on some sore place and irritate it.
0x11d8d58a87596142c62b1c5e7f46f53c4ef1124f but at the same time he marvelled at the power of controlling himself and hiding his feelings in a patient who the previous day had, like a monomaniac, fallen into a frenzy at the slightest word.
0x1d72cd7c88ca3541afdf738598646983158731df “yes, i see myself now that i am almost well,” said raskolnikov, giving his mother and sister a kiss of welcome which made pulcheria alexandrovna radiant at once.
0x469bcb4fe94f87f475af80429896646199b3ecd6 “and i don’t say this _as i did yesterday_,” he said, addressing razumihin, with a friendly pressure of his hand.
0x646d89377ba0e904530f97223bb44cc05ea179d4 “yes, indeed, i am quite surprised at him to-day,” began zossimov, much delighted at the ladies’ entrance, for he had not succeeded in keeping up a conversation with his patient for ten minutes.
0x931cb2a6997a1a0d81f2726c8a50e2c2bc3434ea “in another three or four days, if he goes on like this, he will be just as before, that is, as he was a month ago, or two... or perhaps even three.
0xbfb72f526626a929f0b8efe94f7673df1ac3d448 this has been coming on for a long while.... eh?
0xdb96c352f689c1c195c51fe01e178001fda1d607 confess, now, that it has been perhaps your own fault?”
0x05e4304d43a8f700ed037a5fb51edd0567b816a1 he added, with a tentative smile, as though still afraid of irritating him.
0xb95c927a63565201f7a82a11f20c3f78f90da20b “it is very possible,” answered raskolnikov coldly.
0xefa97209d8723c31839c57fcfebf89f3ace4b6c9 “i should say, too,” continued zossimov with zest, “that your complete recovery depends solely on yourself.
0x7a6c1547bf3256354d9a6620ef872cc646af4491 now that one can talk to you, i should like to impress upon you that it is essential to avoid the elementary, so to speak, fundamental causes tending to produce your morbid condition: in that case you will be cured, if not, it will go from bad to worse.
0x2181b28a666af7257735f0b81cc20e240db1caac these fundamental causes i don’t know, but they must be known to you.
0x11a52bd99a48975d7f74aa2b00e04e516d368aec you are an intelligent man, and must have observed yourself, of course.
0x54f87b2252679038ae48ac25869f8216981b61ff i fancy the first stage of your derangement coincides with your leaving the university.
0x153dbf116f036e2b2f7cae3c684766d07a8235a8 you must not be left without occupation, and so, work and a definite aim set before you might, i fancy, be very beneficial.”
0xaac93af516eaffd260ae31d8ac1b3da793e4f48e “yes, yes; you are perfectly right.... i will make haste and return to the university: and then everything will go smoothly....” zossimov, who had begun his sage advice partly to make an effect before the ladies, was certainly somewhat mystified, when, glancing at his patient, he observed unmistakable mockery on his face.
0x45899c105de9eb0c7cb132e54ca507faefe3068e this lasted an instant, however.
0xf34f5005efc080b76b4d80542f24a1114ac0d5aa pulcheria alexandrovna began at once thanking zossimov, especially for his visit to their lodging the previous night.
0xe5223fdb02d9ee9ecf8a04f7116dd98e3afde8a1 “what!
0x4d3c24bcffa3426c7d4af0c201d70cca0a0e2707 he saw you last night?”
0xbdf596a5c5e41dc56ead13a032e5b00397d31061 raskolnikov asked, as though startled.
0x6d2dcab0cb7a230493a3f02d6bacc304b53fc27e “then you have not slept either after your journey.”
0x746c076536889a95ed3071aa3c9ca0370f3e93c6 “ach, rodya, that was only till two o’clock.
0x9312a092f69812ae4e247a5396d63d5821d89c92 dounia and i never go to bed before two at home.”
0x33f2ccfe3448d8e88087fbb1c037ae1bc2990543 “i don’t know how to thank him either,” raskolnikov went on, suddenly frowning and looking down.
0xc3563245f7eaf232b14db76e8c08134c3e1cc3fb “setting aside the question of payment--forgive me for referring to it (he turned to zossimov)--i really don’t know what i have done to deserve such special attention from you!
0x6dd80c4fcb68e66d58119d96b3ba0c9e28dd1622 i simply don’t understand it... and... and... it weighs upon me, indeed, because i don’t understand it.
0xaad7a5d918fca7fa23c7be3f759c95a3b356595e i tell you so candidly.”
0xfd037d604835f4565d85f85472c394f26bb1944f “don’t be irritated.”
0xfb328a6dab74d627c568f565abc27321d7dff25d zossimov forced himself to laugh.
0xae21247aa13de73971029e011d9cbeefccd3a6e7 “assume that you are my first patient--well--we fellows just beginning to practise love our first patients as if they were our children, and some almost fall in love with them.
0xca0fdf1b1c54759d417b4ba2f308ec4df14e844d and, of course, i am not rich in patients.”
0x36602c85c7bdbab70006afcbcf728be201462869 “i say nothing about him,” added raskolnikov, pointing to razumihin, “though he has had nothing from me either but insult and trouble.”
0xdd04680c30d69c6086f14f3fd0ec3d3b343fada7 “what nonsense he is talking!
0x2077980bf911a15ee5c96d900422bbc0b84e968d why, you are in a sentimental mood to-day, are you?”
0xc4cfd2b08bfa79be0c6e83ab05c92be979656a02 shouted razumihin.
0x3df6f4e2bb252312511eed221d4c4a97ff263bdd if he had had more penetration he would have seen that there was no trace of sentimentality in him, but something indeed quite the opposite.
0xaaaa98983de0e4e7dba12d62383691ce3c425705 but avdotya romanovna noticed it.
0x16a61f799f48f6d6ae5fa7f00cc97b6d405aa71a she was intently and uneasily watching her brother.
0x71442d6506c5651281ead6962fc920d1ac19cc48 “as for you, mother, i don’t dare to speak,” he went on, as though repeating a lesson learned by heart.
0x6f010bb656ef06f43c2b7f56644b97ce7032d34d “it is only to-day that i have been able to realise a little how distressed you must have been here yesterday, waiting for me to come back.”
0x23fb904204d2a0587be4afa1b2896bb2b93d478f when he had said this, he suddenly held out his hand to his sister, smiling without a word.
0xa1cadbd00e9b211300fd031b919281f67b731e4a but in this smile there was a flash of real unfeigned feeling.
0xc4d6e68e4be55a7bda9ca546d1e548bb2018cef2 dounia caught it at once, and warmly pressed his hand, overjoyed and thankful.
0x1211afbafde735a10d31d762995e5edb59c1dcce it was the first time he had addressed her since their dispute the previous day.
0x55db89b88d51da4e534cca6db9b49d27081309e6 the mother’s face lighted up with ecstatic happiness at the sight of this conclusive unspoken reconciliation.
0x71fc37f107d3f2ff330229571ff02bdf06cb4f98 “yes, that is what i love him for,” razumihin, exaggerating it all, muttered to himself, with a vigorous turn in his chair.
0x99c8e609c8b2f5c296ecbac011ee492af6b1cc94 “he has these movements.”
0xf4d4823ff6c922e54353de71c430231879525a5c “and how well he does it all,” the mother was thinking to herself.
0x7cb6f1817f088d667bf6ac158ad696eb9266afe2 “what generous impulses he has, and how simply, how delicately he put an end to all the misunderstanding with his sister--simply by holding out his hand at the right minute and looking at her like that.... and what fine eyes he has, and how fine his whole face is!... he is even better looking than dounia.... but, good heavens, what a suit--how terribly he’s dressed!... vasya, the messenger boy in afanasy ivanitch’s shop, is better dressed!
0x72686e316c85d8fb3a46d1ac11302fb2e6daf758 i could rush at him and hug him... weep over him--but i am afraid.... oh, dear, he’s so strange!
0x6f73e2d871fa6612a620eef76229a8477d540230 he’s talking kindly, but i’m afraid!
0x05d91db0d440fa731b53c890a8e0a62ba11938ca why, what am i afraid of?...”
0x0976bc93c87473e771e37a29ba0d1fba724b497e “oh, rodya, you wouldn’t believe,” she began suddenly, in haste to answer his words to her, “how unhappy dounia and i were yesterday!
0xf20fe9c8c18b508ab77150a61d55770d85d537f9 now that it’s all over and done with and we are quite happy again--i can tell you.
0x144550b699123895b338a78c84f4bc5ec095ff11 fancy, we ran here almost straight from the train to embrace you and that woman--ah, here she is!
0xdef7bbf2917ff1379c9e9b8551dbabb3f52b1aa7 good morning, nastasya!... she told us at once that you were lying in a high fever and had just run away from the doctor in delirium, and they were looking for you in the streets.
0x7aa8313771291234bb833d9c693d44e373987d50 you can’t imagine how we felt!
0xbe88623c80e554ddf6a05bacd1b10ce538420e75 i couldn’t help thinking of the tragic end of lieutenant potanchikov, a friend of your father’s--you can’t remember him, rodya--who ran out in the same way in a high fever and fell into the well in the court-yard and they couldn’t pull him out till next day.
0x432802bfb22ad09a4b99681cc18cb236f1f38593 of course, we exaggerated things.
0x627a2a20ce8f5c0e7a72fe0502cbac6f4251dfa1 we were on the point of rushing to find pyotr petrovitch to ask him to help.... because we were alone, utterly alone,” she said plaintively and stopped short, suddenly, recollecting it was still somewhat dangerous to speak of pyotr petrovitch, although “we are quite happy again.”
0xeccde0cd721df9f804abc50304a5e886efb8e4fc “yes, yes.... of course it’s very annoying....” raskolnikov muttered in reply, but with such a preoccupied and inattentive air that dounia gazed at him in perplexity.
0xf57c284b832a29d820c39dc34dbd9d2bf86823d7 “what else was it i wanted to say?”
0xe476d8fbfe9b942c4d03265cc0c813963d2ffff0 he went on trying to recollect.
0x75393241542d87bfb20c6d03b10c6adfcc3904ab “oh, yes; mother, and you too, dounia, please don’t think that i didn’t mean to come and see you to-day and was waiting for you to come first.”
0x7b0a3d34a26123aa8ad3385226fd28c28d82cd49 “what are you saying, rodya?”
0xfe21f45cad12407fc9e8dd89dfa8187a4d31cb4f cried pulcheria alexandrovna.
0xcf9b41351f6a03cc5d2b9cfc02c6ea6fa4510c43 she, too, was surprised.
0xeff890ac39dd24cf6dcb217679fc6dfab1b351bf “is he answering us as a duty?”
0xc86adc33bcd2b6b6789bc67cdd772846d99164f6 dounia wondered.
0xe856f1afe4b64af8ef480e28df2a30263e427864 “is he being reconciled and asking forgiveness as though he were performing a rite or repeating a lesson?”
0xd0e5236e71c3ba3d1ba7fb068755ab0181860d63 “i’ve only just waked up, and wanted to go to you, but was delayed owing to my clothes; i forgot yesterday to ask her... nastasya... to wash out the blood... i’ve only just dressed.”
0x539b3092bcca64aa674a0c6962f30bd59241a735 “blood!
0xd604d36baef055f376580c279f8a563595aa1bb2 what blood?”
0x1bc8d30a355e3f2c3672b2c219443499f55b98fa pulcheria alexandrovna asked in alarm.
0x6647ecf8a19b92538dcf192a6c3c7461b70f11de “oh, nothing--don’t be uneasy.
0xf6da2111ac279a237ceb3f7468ce7074772a0d4d it was when i was wandering about yesterday, rather delirious, i chanced upon a man who had been run over... a clerk...” “delirious?
0x712de6b7fbe687b972a7b2015caad3f56e9a632a but you remember everything!”
0xa3a03b1554b0004909b840a230d6906fef728200 razumihin interrupted.
0xabc013252e05aa919727ad8170336b80f9a12a4d “that’s true,” raskolnikov answered with special carefulness.
0x01be431d41d9882d3067d288ec296846c43af1d3 “i remember everything even to the slightest detail, and yet--why i did that and went there and said that, i can’t clearly explain now.”
0xc994392656afc1cf199169a329174c8f68153c59 “a familiar phenomenon,” interposed zossimov, “actions are sometimes performed in a masterly and most cunning way, while the direction of the actions is deranged and dependent on various morbid impressions--it’s like a dream.”
0xdc465d18804bd9e3e0aacf73af955b4b106e0e80 “perhaps it’s a good thing really that he should think me almost a madman,” thought raskolnikov.
0x6de26ab768869a09a695a70b2d4eb3bc8701e637 “why, people in perfect health act in the same way too,” observed dounia, looking uneasily at zossimov.
0x4e133e1530189f4a0583d571dec0c79699c14d4a “there is some truth in your observation,” the latter replied.
0x128a712bf559ecceb241ce6ee84c0ace282afa4b “in that sense we are certainly all not infrequently like madmen, but with the slight difference that the deranged are somewhat madder, for we must draw a line.
0x8e48a9169c493f741d3ccf976eaaebbadfd0cc7c a normal man, it is true, hardly exists.
0x771da045d86b291cf2eacd39f673ac5ab8ad1375 among dozens--perhaps hundreds of thousands--hardly one is to be met with.”
0xdcd18109a3db1bd5ff4c666d41f1305a4c4de8ab at the word “madman,” carelessly dropped by zossimov in his chatter on his favourite subject, everyone frowned.
0xe3d2bd1995858ef41364dc7347ae126eab72d46a raskolnikov sat seeming not to pay attention, plunged in thought with a strange smile on his pale lips.
0x65e26db8a0df7c22abb70be99740e141e92ed4ae he was still meditating on something.
0x6b04c03b4fe6f14873930b11e9a8460f9271e540 “well, what about the man who was run over?
0x6a5e44b3236207d19b6d76788bf08442fba7fd80 i interrupted you!”
0xda9b89917549fe3a8f3c6e21b1395189461257aa razumihin cried hastily.
0xe289aec3e0f10cf03bf5f5877dd53b83ef42d86f “what?”
0x8ab4f166810831c42e6934435430c5f004cfd589 raskolnikov seemed to wake up.
0xb5b8a837ceca4045aefbf01adb8570a16336b800 “oh... i got spattered with blood helping to carry him to his lodging.
0xff42fcdff560b0aa43f9efffbc229655eb14a372 by the way, mamma, i did an unpardonable thing yesterday.
0x4f73fc47287bde4adc70028cbfc19082cfd7e891 i was literally out of my mind.
0xe5f4ca25d9c724e80ba55c6a826b902ba0d961c8 i gave away all the money you sent me... to his wife for the funeral.
0xdfc31dc65c72db98ba8304f0ec509164ca92176a she’s a widow now, in consumption, a poor creature... three little children, starving... nothing in the house... there’s a daughter, too... perhaps you’d have given it yourself if you’d seen them.
0x2c1fe3d9ce98c641c4e04b93307142dac76c1d95 but i had no right to do it i admit, especially as i knew how you needed the money yourself.
0xd9937f3c72c659df8697fc8fb878a251895a2914 to help others one must have the right to do it, or else _crevez, chiens, si vous n’êtes pas contents_.”
0x43ae3edc87c738394c4e0454fb46cb02df94e2ef he laughed, “that’s right, isn’t it, dounia?”
0x5b1dc812b0728a51ac87fdbe2b2fcf28883ea073 “no, it’s not,” answered dounia firmly.
0x539b00565457c7954002b505dd481d3699ead8f8 “bah!
0xb69d49ece1d10d93240f55d1a85944c014ec2f0a you, too, have ideals,” he muttered, looking at her almost with hatred, and smiling sarcastically.
0x4b4425dba5ce250e563e7844c892ab4b1f9803b6 “i ought to have considered that.... well, that’s praiseworthy, and it’s better for you... and if you reach a line you won’t overstep, you will be unhappy... and if you overstep it, maybe you will be still unhappier.... but all that’s nonsense,” he added irritably, vexed at being carried away.
0xba68ff7b19d837337038635993fb57246ce82107 “i only meant to say that i beg your forgiveness, mother,” he concluded, shortly and abruptly.
0x70f63a9348d3836a185ed988519adf342e0858ef “that’s enough, rodya, i am sure that everything you do is very good,” said his mother, delighted.
0xf2f89b3ac6f987619f789c41cc99ecdc051a24f8 “don’t be too sure,” he answered, twisting his mouth into a smile.
0x96e6f246252368336ab5424e3e548bf9b931b60a a silence followed.
0xf14f54fc5e05b5b18989a25bc721c5dfd8602d44 there was a certain constraint in all this conversation, and in the silence, and in the reconciliation, and in the forgiveness, and all were feeling it.
0x3e81b1635108d08619623b22154693a111a654b4 “it is as though they were afraid of me,” raskolnikov was thinking to himself, looking askance at his mother and sister.
0x2b2fbf0b25923cd57dc3791f7abcb4bcee8048f0 pulcheria alexandrovna was indeed growing more timid the longer she kept silent.
0x997b8f83bcb54ed9c2b07ed606ccdc799849f8cd “yet in their absence i seemed to love them so much,” flashed through his mind.
0xa178672050a917a06a57d7a6e1fe880ff70e3372 “do you know, rodya, marfa petrovna is dead,” pulcheria alexandrovna suddenly blurted out.
0xa8d1dc867a12fe3d4633d9baacaa0f9289c31a32 “what marfa petrovna?”
0x84d2c5ed1a2facc2630cfad7939162a2ca238bdf “oh, mercy on us--marfa petrovna svidrigaïlov.
0x76b7fc299a458830e4184624570c81011f352413 i wrote you so much about her.”
0x2fa98f8044c91cde1c55c1d8017e402cb9e8d133 “a-a-h!
0x303643b2fde3820fa42ff9d97b48294b693d751b yes, i remember.... so she’s dead!
0x7ee06834c7935368b8eb590532ecc7ede8a24fe0 oh, really?”
0x92421d56777bf177521b07d8d4a1509aec6b695d he roused himself suddenly, as if waking up.
0x19bdd46dca830b6c7d9fc9e47a1d18d6fdc0fa1c “what did she die of?”
0x65b4525077e48f053b0702f8eb52ef56f651c81d “only imagine, quite suddenly,” pulcheria alexandrovna answered hurriedly, encouraged by his curiosity.
0x840ecb9b12046e4a6e9433441414bd7d7ce9e490 “on the very day i was sending you that letter!
0x9aa1351fa294efd6d50927f5766c5720dd61da2a would you believe it, that awful man seems to have been the cause of her death.
0x6a57cb66ebe188803f26d49ecde7cb7fd2a87fb4 they say he beat her dreadfully.”
0x32437cbb2072e529b98c6202d60322f61f8753e7 “why, were they on such bad terms?”
0x6a396b9151c3eb0a22e7fff512fab4362d43d72d he asked, addressing his sister.
0xfa97258d92350e5d39bd8787ae9d21b97c7e901e “not at all.
0xb329e5e27949b5dbd350ed20ad566c9273d3a2a6 quite the contrary indeed.
0x9fd0c53a5bd3fc542a509bba8a04433837f8b738 with her, he was always very patient, considerate even.
0xe638dddff17c8f4b12258c8d4fd35cb6fc126ee4 in fact, all those seven years of their married life he gave way to her, too much so indeed, in many cases.
0xd75a6478eab3a466873d6c935a7a8808f4d3ae19 all of a sudden he seems to have lost patience.”
0x0d65df3f253546e20e5e7290d9ef4b5a9303633d “then he could not have been so awful if he controlled himself for seven years?
0xe5da4b4adcd41582e65e2b111e48e3cf4b057616 you seem to be defending him, dounia?”
0xac1c7d6b8d5a66d545b6358c05ee203235781ec6 “no, no, he’s an awful man!
0x4dc4916106bddd7af14f72414d15087afa6d5539 i can imagine nothing more awful!”
0x1484a4b7fd583262bf81fedcef7d8ceb15bd581e dounia answered, almost with a shudder, knitting her brows, and sinking into thought.
0xbf27b77063e6b3315fabb7651f2eb818ae9b43cc “that had happened in the morning,” pulcheria alexandrovna went on hurriedly.
0xd204f018ca27a59781756d28cd9079476ca2f8a6 “and directly afterwards she ordered the horses to be harnessed to drive to the town immediately after dinner.
0xdb6c8539e976777cac500b1531e7a7769253c6cb she always used to drive to the town in such cases.
0x9c9f9bd9cac2d2498e72a2dcef0b0566e9b0f171 she ate a very good dinner, i am told....” “after the beating?”
0x0bca2161c763bf48df169ef4560d650799cb56c2 “that was always her... habit; and immediately after dinner, so as not to be late in starting, she went to the bath-house.... you see, she was undergoing some treatment with baths.
0x2d920f81e11f183dea5ade2b93493344b545484a they have a cold spring there, and she used to bathe in it regularly every day, and no sooner had she got into the water when she suddenly had a stroke!”
0x2b575f4658d877134dde2a53ba2e7838259e4767 “i should think so,” said zossimov.
0x91855b46e3f5faf57697d6eaf71c6140dde75065 “and did he beat her badly?”
0xac204575e6a73afe5d2535bc323cba8b42d7b36a “what does that matter!”
0x9f969ff134d245c569fc92eb580583b5e1ed0a0d put in dounia.
0x9aff9ce9f525b78a0852bb5f03feea4555ef29fb “h’m!
0x98d2dbb02dfc638762caca70a828398d96fb302b but i don’t know why you want to tell us such gossip, mother,” said raskolnikov irritably, as it were in spite of himself.
0xdaa0421603951bc619df27c9bffb0180237cb081 “ah, my dear, i don’t know what to talk about,” broke from pulcheria alexandrovna.
0xa3bc28770bf94d8dda7a95305e611f2208cb6b95 “why, are you all afraid of me?”
0xe347720e3fb8b17efeff4c88591f4b4b9ce24eb3 he asked, with a constrained smile.
0x438ec6e66119bcbb05bd240e8a1d68d659c17485 “that’s certainly true,” said dounia, looking directly and sternly at her brother.
0x76960bbc3a11f9b1ac400d692bf60da93f5440b9 “mother was crossing herself with terror as she came up the stairs.”
0x031452706e86b1ee0dff373095dcaa5c350f6aac his face worked, as though in convulsion.
0x21a709cdcdfc243a2325a56e1b4ce35a315cd4b0 “ach, what are you saying, dounia!
0x74f6e6a306c98dd77fb0073ed5381d9f07c866ab don’t be angry, please, rodya.... why did you say that, dounia?”
0xb6e7202856ba460b94afcf8ba8acbced9a2b87ff pulcheria alexandrovna began, overwhelmed--“you see, coming here, i was dreaming all the way, in the train, how we should meet, how we should talk over everything together.... and i was so happy, i did not notice the journey!
0xd7c018307b9b662916e58778494c57ce00e6aeb7 but what am i saying?
0x81ab1a4f5c61a72f89a0e49431c182efc8bded51 i am happy now.... you should not, dounia.... i am happy now--simply in seeing you, rodya....” “hush, mother,” he muttered in confusion, not looking at her, but pressing her hand.
0x1fb1fc150fe3f4172cd4c5a986394145c0fcfd30 “we shall have time to speak freely of everything!”
0x6a858a3e1434d343aaf33b643e2e9d67931182aa as he said this, he was suddenly overwhelmed with confusion and turned pale.
0xe771f3f244f55827bf3fa397672fdd26d13819f4 again that awful sensation he had known of late passed with deadly chill over his soul.
0x824bf5ae9678f72a28c437bb0da2d63c66a807ff again it became suddenly plain and perceptible to him that he had just told a fearful lie--that he would never now be able to speak freely of everything--that he would never again be able to _speak_ of anything to anyone.
0x2738776c83ab9611b97d618aa9826cb6addfd4f1 the anguish of this thought was such that for a moment he almost forgot himself.
0x1b6ef6137f2a416652be844099a0a2b93d3c2875 he got up from his seat, and not looking at anyone walked towards the door.
0xbaf6cca0739e8c8ea7420da6bd75360daf41e2ca “what are you about?”
0x2c30e5e68b375d20f5c0bfaa428ca522f3d19204 cried razumihin, clutching him by the arm.
0x73b6216ab8f5242ab28d04fdcc68b8498989ef84 he sat down again, and began looking about him, in silence.
0x95742fbf0a6652a9692605680ab7d9ca37b191e1 they were all looking at him in perplexity.
0x28db68127f022fb7aa6d7ce2f84351f3425f2a9c “but what are you all so dull for?”
0x74ac79c99f86d0ed81451bffe10e3e3852dec7da he shouted, suddenly and quite unexpectedly.
0x1025eae95b6ae379817c7c487896a0fe64994a5f “do say something!
0x136eb9e531594fae933af7bf8f86f3d38147afdb what’s the use of sitting like this?
0x394be8cafbd5dc35c58b964396811a56ccbc8338 come, do speak.
0x80e5b65f7c543dd12f3202e0b306071273b2cea8 let us talk.... we meet together and sit in silence.... come, anything!”
0x8511cacabf6205b085ca5e7e5184962b9f9155e1 “thank god; i was afraid the same thing as yesterday was beginning again,” said pulcheria alexandrovna, crossing herself.
0x3dc9917bc53dbff9a921f4484c5d6cccd93d86df “what is the matter, rodya?”
0xa95dbcb9ae97fc92c33c751635a8bed1675fb354 asked avdotya romanovna, distrustfully.
0x98f1cbe23d410d02661ae15a09788bf14cb92f8a “oh, nothing!
0x3521bd9f5911aa0d5ea4ba77a8b2b1a529bd85f7 i remembered something,” he answered, and suddenly laughed.
0x024d702c8fdf1675136632566a904d68adffd489 “well, if you remembered something; that’s all right!... i was beginning to think...” muttered zossimov, getting up from the sofa.
0x91039607a919c44dd88991d1328abd0dc49ae176 “it is time for me to be off.
0xf8522d45f9b39147903049df96778c2797e0f674 i will look in again perhaps... if i can...” he made his bows, and went out.
0xe00a8bec99fc22b30b6680031d91d371ca72d1b3 “what an excellent man!”
0xbd6bbe3467bd5270e94a1d9bec8ef9700e08b75f observed pulcheria alexandrovna.
0xef84cb4d034ef37190dd232c93ebaa5689b5884b “yes, excellent, splendid, well-educated, intelligent,” raskolnikov began, suddenly speaking with surprising rapidity, and a liveliness he had not shown till then.
0xebb572543d7c7ca19cb6db0264cc4b5bc47925d8 “i can’t remember where i met him before my illness.... i believe i have met him somewhere----... and this is a good man, too,” he nodded at razumihin.
0xf3cbec6b0fe619beeade0f7fcdb56e1b0dbb9111 “do you like him, dounia?”
0xe7d87c8232f744fa447feaaf57da6b0f11a0677b he asked her; and suddenly, for some unknown reason, laughed.
0x7db607309d9b8e7c7fd924d9697a16b8d088639a “very much,” answered dounia.
0xa60eb2e6f4b37c225b1cdb175800fdea2ccf2a50 “foo!--what a pig you are!”
0x1293d069b82238d25834cb9abf57a24a979f35c9 razumihin protested, blushing in terrible confusion, and he got up from his chair.
0x299402218039a14d7bf64b7b555ad51ffc5ddedc pulcheria alexandrovna smiled faintly, but raskolnikov laughed aloud.
0x873e4d495d6ada5470af8c966593aa2c0abe7896 “where are you off to?”
0x4469f9c21148539b00935ad85d938abdb083934f “i must go.”
0x4b4c337593df294095aafca7be35ad956f782643 “you need not at all.
0x688a39e9166f7314039980ada8a02a65757f0200 stay.
0x5c227255ff739befc56957c92e7aab2d86a8a731 zossimov has gone, so you must.
0xb415ffa0d960db75b41c13da09df89ae615dbb64 don’t go.
0xce2c42220abeb4569c158c77bea8797fcb783a57 what’s the time?
0x1e012bdd18a81e1f9d6ff4d461aeff455403e75d is it twelve o’clock?
0x9569800643d3dbb7dbe16bfcde01340dc2384ea1 what a pretty watch you have got, dounia.
0xb3f7a7677668a397e68e661045a6a4bdeeab8bec but why are you all silent again?
0x5102358f0ff07a87b70487f2988450a47673b51b i do all the talking.”
0x434a324b54e654f4748f76ff22bc4076a4500d88 “it was a present from marfa petrovna,” answered dounia.
0x6191e975b6240262749533b2463bae5031a9d5e5 “and a very expensive one!”
0x58de44aa8961754bb8de9f1afd945a087e05a882 added pulcheria alexandrovna.
0x3640b97d989f1be00a305b8eea1a5d1f3ee6ea62 “a-ah!
0x929e4e32df61e4d5dbfa8857b55b4c40f7811d65 what a big one!
0x00995c1173b4612d9fae2993e2c3537339bd2139 hardly like a lady’s.”
0x0c669491cdc4465d10787e9b8cf90b978c0b8c23 “i like that sort,” said dounia.
0xb0a579f2510aa43ad61b8619d8e3aa37ff9cf016 “so it is not a present from her _fiancé_,” thought razumihin, and was unreasonably delighted.
0xe26a20345aef5c43dd618653992b48455e81715b “i thought it was luzhin’s present,” observed raskolnikov.
0xe3bfb1f8efdf830d84b1776ce01674c6b8fcc70a “no, he has not made dounia any presents yet.”
0x3640b97d989f1be00a305b8eea1a5d1f3ee6ea62 “a-ah!
0xac50741ff305ed767945f652e04f21689faa97d2 and do you remember, mother, i was in love and wanted to get married?”
0xcb9c2e52e27505e0e216e4f2342a38ab432f1069 he said suddenly, looking at his mother, who was disconcerted by the sudden change of subject and the way he spoke of it.
0xf306c6c41889ac5b865cb561e02a62b2bf349875 “oh, yes, my dear.”
0x3e6e13ad734e2068c797336c88a0aee3ff5187b3 pulcheria alexandrovna exchanged glances with dounia and razumihin.
0x26910fe75dbfd4e93f229dff1f10cf90685f7e10 “h’m, yes.
0xb9e13d67dce6ca96948e2bff79fcee61fff92d24 what shall i tell you?
0xe4e3b2c1f427777ceeea968f618a1166cf8fb344 i don’t remember much indeed.
0xb81d1446f8cf1a5e241ad7d0142e9858ef1ddd6a she was such a sickly girl,” he went on, growing dreamy and looking down again.
0x31f4404f088729e79473a2c5cb6b2bf197c59d05 “quite an invalid.
0x118bafdfc74bc8fb6f64c1e62e2b6f0bc53cbfee she was fond of giving alms to the poor, and was always dreaming of a nunnery, and once she burst into tears when she began talking to me about it.
0x1d4b26acd1a7f5b1ed711d760169a27af7d56109 yes, yes, i remember.
0xc07fc4cda47b6cd6e1ff925bd3e7585913bea9d7 i remember very well.
0xa9550c2dd13791e77f03d5456bf2765fddc89b91 she was an ugly little thing.
0x78eb6c8802e5959ca1666d364305aaebea8b62bb i really don’t know what drew me to her then--i think it was because she was always ill. if she had been lame or hunchback, i believe i should have liked her better still,” he smiled dreamily.
0xdf15429336b9d652878353c4489bcea033c37444 “yes, it was a sort of spring delirium.”
0x8d18fb402b372ff34792113999eb376a0f2ceecb “no, it was not only spring delirium,” said dounia, with warm feeling.
0xb1ccd89f93db0bb593e7f3516817d89439168bdb he fixed a strained intent look on his sister, but did not hear or did not understand her words.
0x4226f2c6dd46082530173906661ad041ee02c338 then, completely lost in thought, he got up, went up to his mother, kissed her, went back to his place and sat down.
0xf15cbf254553eb56e5d479e302a6a6600ad30555 “you love her even now?”
0x14b496da727239b87797320c073ca8cca4924eaf said pulcheria alexandrovna, touched.
0x85a8a980200630af0ebdb2765c50052fb6975dbe “her?
0x344bed2f03d7f64733d65c54b9d3f2abd63a2165 now?
0x80a8f43060ce444a80b688e72899ffb2334b252a oh, yes.... you ask about her?
0x2aa1d933d7329132debf77911e65e48e47234529 no... that’s all now, as it were, in another world... and so long ago.
0xe5910c325499eb6a2915332bee9f1051bf3b2de8 and indeed everything happening here seems somehow far away.”
0x573ba42840fbe0a7f5b9d6d2481ce5dff2ec4f7a he looked attentively at them.
0x6c71f4ba726de1c60b1981f35131b85dcafdbcff “you, now... i seem to be looking at you from a thousand miles away... but, goodness knows why we are talking of that!
0x4afbf071561b0f7f9066ae775a041205a5003bc5 and what’s the use of asking about it?”
0xe5395bb1dca2b3e4d7e1d76a49c0d65640cd944b he added with annoyance, and biting his nails, fell into dreamy silence again.
0xa794a65e9a1a8efd721cf4bcf14fc39ffe442f44 “what a wretched lodging you have, rodya!
0x25e7ffd383a4e864e708897bb71fade258bd09d3 it’s like a tomb,” said pulcheria alexandrovna, suddenly breaking the oppressive silence.
0x49c059cb105613e42a084ca43235ffb27b8ebd9b “i am sure it’s quite half through your lodging you have become so melancholy.”
0x0d5fd6104aa8d24e8b703bbf978d88f1bb663cff “my lodging,” he answered, listlessly.
0x3788c5de90a8d924c176cdebb611ecce77df84a2 “yes, the lodging had a great deal to do with it.... i thought that, too.... if only you knew, though, what a strange thing you said just now, mother,” he said, laughing strangely.
0xf3853b5be4f50fc2cc0b4a62f163e1490981a940 a little more, and their companionship, this mother and this sister, with him after three years’ absence, this intimate tone of conversation, in face of the utter impossibility of really speaking about anything, would have been beyond his power of endurance.
0xdcff4e97aa1f6427ae0bb47f5a200a4185c5ba31 but there was one urgent matter which must be settled one way or the other that day--so he had decided when he woke.
0x59e6785130ae2ea6836236c260dce42d5f15b6e9 now he was glad to remember it, as a means of escape.
0x611532883ee4ff52a5abd6fdb22e9748f7e5d133 “listen, dounia,” he began, gravely and drily, “of course i beg your pardon for yesterday, but i consider it my duty to tell you again that i do not withdraw from my chief point.
0xf2cbf80ed0a4d727780521e3b45ea5422419ac3e it is me or luzhin.
0x9f5387c51cadd8244bea09442f9a6d807dd86d76 if i am a scoundrel, you must not be.
0x37deea84f5d207986998696d2a8b84b344aaff1b one is enough.
0x1dac784381d64b7f2108f28e8356b0f96c6c0f2c if you marry luzhin, i cease at once to look on you as a sister.”
0xe5e039c5d589605f9c2063c28bda70f3ae61e0b2 “rodya, rodya!
0xd5ad42a91895ba0b079c5398b636a7586acfa19d it is the same as yesterday again,” pulcheria alexandrovna cried, mournfully.
0x9925fc109135f38a301dc6f8ecc407b053cd0a68 “and why do you call yourself a scoundrel?
0xfe528f9411dcbba8b71ac416c831921a3442ef14 i can’t bear it.
0xd65effb7a0ae48cb3496d4c451951d2252520288 you said the same yesterday.”
0xe1b40f5383e0fe1ee4a9a9b6d1dba6afdbc1bfed “brother,” dounia answered firmly and with the same dryness.
0x85fd6e4134051524a113e9779e434a57fc9e2960 “in all this there is a mistake on your part.
0xbeed81759fc5144528cee0580c1e3d60e08b35a5 i thought it over at night, and found out the mistake.
0xe2eee7b6c68d189db0dd62bb7d688e790b71f5bf it is all because you seem to fancy i am sacrificing myself to someone and for someone.
0x37b8bda843534a2b4a93a19a86a7a6daf35172f2 that is not the case at all.
0x6e0aaace98e5591670871b917e4dc1ddb7244b72 i am simply marrying for my own sake, because things are hard for me.
0x6759f703faddaa3e3e772443951ef22f450d170c though, of course, i shall be glad if i succeed in being useful to my family.
0x48e22c64c33626f7e40cd39935186388ec8be54d but that is not the chief motive for my decision....” “she is lying,” he thought to himself, biting his nails vindictively.
0x0b5656bffcdd371deca0d0162606b7412a2eac0e “proud creature!
0x00843405da5a9ecf1b6e6420e635328540bb378b she won’t admit she wants to do it out of charity!
0x0cd329dc229b172c116142bbfbb8f426cd51e10e too haughty!
0xa19ac5793f2d6599acca8c53297e42b495ce0ea7 oh, base characters!
0x770b2c490a38ffd0da4b09c2d88542efbf44bd94 they even love as though they hate.... oh, how i... hate them all!”
0x0f761111cc644e02f2d72da85cc866ad6857e778 “in fact,” continued dounia, “i am marrying pyotr petrovitch because of two evils i choose the less.
0x97a25b6cc4ba754e1a58ed71563f7dc40159c027 i intend to do honestly all he expects of me, so i am not deceiving him.... why did you smile just now?”
0x3dcdfa71dd4b5b357c2ce0deb13f67f594408db0 she, too, flushed, and there was a gleam of anger in her eyes.
0xeff9a9deab0593f4ccae6ab8b624592d41dba390 “all?”
0x52c45c777bc21d2d05edc1b2150f210a5e525e80 he asked, with a malignant grin.
0x86f26d354397f8836d85e9cc73ac162e2be83e8b “within certain limits.
0x4fba357b6ba1f70d6593e514fb4d9053362602e8 both the manner and form of pyotr petrovitch’s courtship showed me at once what he wanted.
0xf96c0cd9e9bb79536d8bd351ceb9a710e59df7d7 he may, of course, think too well of himself, but i hope he esteems me, too.... why are you laughing again?”
0x287a68cc6add973995b7865b07e13fa1cc738e9a “and why are you blushing again?
0x8d3efbf021e65c09d96255d23e213a9599cf97fd you are lying, sister.
0x6ddbde262475c7ed187dc06b6d4c0e4d05019b31 you are intentionally lying, simply from feminine obstinacy, simply to hold your own against me.... you cannot respect luzhin.
0xfb81bbb9df2d3655d75b539b87a27d5e97598c6e i have seen him and talked with him.
0xe745ee5542da048fbaa019190541591bf312420a so you are selling yourself for money, and so in any case you are acting basely, and i am glad at least that you can blush for it.”
0x590df82f97c3112d9321a0a780407c5f6df9bfaf “it is not true.
0x3722521902fc02b9c6b880a0b67eea60da22b838 i am not lying,” cried dounia, losing her composure.
0x5ea8a29602f92ad5f91a00da17742babd166382a “i would not marry him if i were not convinced that he esteems me and thinks highly of me.
0xf6993d44800e1039845be3a33112569554782f49 i would not marry him if i were not firmly convinced that i can respect him.
0x95d42d9c0da6114da02986b1b093ba1f3de5bf5a fortunately, i can have convincing proof of it this very day... and such a marriage is not a vileness, as you say!
0x70036d4519e96887b5c77bcf5bbb81148763ef84 and even if you were right, if i really had determined on a vile action, is it not merciless on your part to speak to me like that?
0x52913a1e65ca0c07fe708586ee9f8dd33159008d why do you demand of me a heroism that perhaps you have not either?
0x3fc2cdb65f8007706ff582575fea17c8398bdf2b it is despotism; it is tyranny.
0x541188038dffa4e9537804720c187960093c29f2 if i ruin anyone, it is only myself.... i am not committing a murder.
0x1530a814abe6176f2e596c31b6c8d765f0b9ea7d why do you look at me like that?
0x1701950ddf4375268db0e3a2bd8c0c8ee2199e9c why are you so pale?
0xe09b80193562f9246c72e1fe425d291a5c1081d6 rodya, darling, what’s the matter?”
0x30b4b680a4068d82e915c51a0631bf04e40c8078 “good heavens!
0x35a3d7da3bd372f93846158e6b3a18e7d57de1dd you have made him faint,” cried pulcheria alexandrovna.
0x0b440080ab49c39766c3689c004e068e9c41fa3a “no, no, nonsense!
0x6c11a77096300df1511cb3ea8e384778f4d66349 it’s nothing.
0x6a2d9f7fe6d4e71e3ec859a8e20e20cbefb00cea a little giddiness--not fainting.
0x9af3426c9db9f971560e2284559255fded19a35b you have fainting on the brain.
0xfb3ddfd1bd375ab7f0c0dfb43c8bfda729090fa2 h’m, yes, what was i saying?
0x14921359376fa381ace3af6d41a56a741b171a8a oh, yes.
0x4cd135f6d7f9781db768cd18e3a5a7c790130f18 in what way will you get convincing proof to-day that you can respect him, and that he... esteems you, as you said.
0x4b50d0093589e17a1bbe00b9cf197dad038e3ef5 i think you said to-day?”
0xc45043c3be6f8bc821b8eda10b134909b35338d5 “mother, show rodya pyotr petrovitch’s letter,” said dounia.
0x561d7c6ccbb9c38ee8d8bcc64340cfae8a3bf0ed with trembling hands, pulcheria alexandrovna gave him the letter.
0xea66db41e9d21cced588b0a94ab53af9a954a5d9 he took it with great interest, but, before opening it, he suddenly looked with a sort of wonder at dounia.
0x87829927706259554070aef706ed3d8b902fef7a “it is strange,” he said, slowly, as though struck by a new idea.
0x968f2fe9b34f268069561c2fca518ff27c8eeb5a “what am i making such a fuss for?
0x293e43d6d8493b03118f9290b2b79604d46ad029 what is it all about?
0xb3b02f6fbb078c53c41fae105eee8045ea212918 marry whom you like!”
0xbf7bb9393720240e9dd4817f799c73f48d295467 he said this as though to himself, but said it aloud, and looked for some time at his sister, as though puzzled.
0x935932db6e5348223bec6452088a0c9fb56aab67 he opened the letter at last, still with the same look of strange wonder on his face.
0x3796623ef182ac5d008cc1a7f57203e3c4c093bd then, slowly and attentively, he began reading, and read it through twice.
0x7de941955a45b781fe81ad4c1b2845158d4480d8 pulcheria alexandrovna showed marked anxiety, and all indeed expected something particular.
0x6f58d2a62e93511d75451df29dbc55d376313d2f “what surprises me,” he began, after a short pause, handing the letter to his mother, but not addressing anyone in particular, “is that he is a business man, a lawyer, and his conversation is pretentious indeed, and yet he writes such an uneducated letter.”
0x3fbd88502a2cc9fcd21d829b4c245c0abd094955 they all started.
0x8bee7a17e75956f79ff75287627d84d83e8196c0 they had expected something quite different.
0x288e25395ca5a0d3e87b13570f085ff9f55b1edc “but they all write like that, you know,” razumihin observed, abruptly.
0x32c07b09d7161610e202852f763a3cb9935ecd99 “have you read it?”
0xa00f66ccca0a0d5e24a747fa3544a07776ae36a4 “yes.”
0xcb12fc3f2f44446d4d0e54ecaf2ef6ea19dd2743 “we showed him, rodya.
0xb43317d0bc33533811ff64dad74d23980d796320 we... consulted him just now,” pulcheria alexandrovna began, embarrassed.
0xe8abac762c868151e189a9d4d61e67a7998ddff3 “that’s just the jargon of the courts,” razumihin put in.
0x9baa6bc002993bb339905e36ab2c60f945df7f52 “legal documents are written like that to this day.”
0x011008e17b1b4af55ee503e5bbfb822006c84adb “legal?
0x86520e16324809af0ede3335924ab128aec7a202 yes, it’s just legal--business language--not so very uneducated, and not quite educated--business language!”
0x89c44a764bd7e48065212c6e18bea4364370370c “pyotr petrovitch makes no secret of the fact that he had a cheap education, he is proud indeed of having made his own way,” avdotya romanovna observed, somewhat offended by her brother’s tone.
0xbb67b67af52533b933a55ef06a18f8d3d2e511d3 “well, if he’s proud of it, he has reason, i don’t deny it.
0xe6b70534b9be65dc190ca5aabbc304af4e27f3ca you seem to be offended, sister, at my making only such a frivolous criticism on the letter, and to think that i speak of such trifling matters on purpose to annoy you.
0x96490e73431e8797837c6e328966a286fa1c5455 it is quite the contrary, an observation apropos of the style occurred to me that is by no means irrelevant as things stand.
0xec0bf889c6863e7efd11a1206e50df131cae6f5c there is one expression, ‘blame yourselves’ put in very significantly and plainly, and there is besides a threat that he will go away at once if i am present.
0x27bb11dc3371086b18cce0b9a50c826470021b2b that threat to go away is equivalent to a threat to abandon you both if you are disobedient, and to abandon you now after summoning you to petersburg.
0x9cb6a0fc12758a74143c6bc7d320b20b3826b56d well, what do you think?
0x522e34717e0fee61249171bb737f1c8f52bbc879 can one resent such an expression from luzhin, as we should if he (he pointed to razumihin) had written it, or zossimov, or one of us?”
0x82a54048be4812137edad70bc51cfcfad2c72467 “n-no,” answered dounia, with more animation.
0xde0974f2751cd6ae4c1e5ae7028ca71d9ebef75d “i saw clearly that it was too naïvely expressed, and that perhaps he simply has no skill in writing... that is a true criticism, brother.
0xd23c82409561826bfa4cb3861cfdf80a6a47088c i did not expect, indeed...” “it is expressed in legal style, and sounds coarser than perhaps he intended.
0x2dc49804f3b6d6905031dff380752f1571922109 but i must disillusion you a little.
0x015db8db126ab7228b7ba56a69952dc44014f8ef there is one expression in the letter, one slander about me, and rather a contemptible one.
0x5f8c1fc26e07c98568296028edc250cef62105e2 i gave the money last night to the widow, a woman in consumption, crushed with trouble, and not ‘on the pretext of the funeral,’ but simply to pay for the funeral, and not to the daughter--a young woman, as he writes, of notorious behaviour (whom i saw last night for the first time in my life)--but to the widow.
0xf991daeb962a33106b53c1f1cf5b7d33d90ecb41 in all this i see a too hasty desire to slander me and to raise dissension between us.
0x4ac1c98b7300bec8790675cb30a5ad464d3777bc it is expressed again in legal jargon, that is to say, with a too obvious display of the aim, and with a very naïve eagerness.
0x9abe288cc09d78e7dbb327ec437328a32257601f he is a man of intelligence, but to act sensibly, intelligence is not enough.
0x2dcf4a4be2f822c77c3e970a64c4e50866e2cdd8 it all shows the man and... i don’t think he has a great esteem for you.
0x05ad817367278b4b4e1c5feae8d484ff2eb5bc77 i tell you this simply to warn you, because i sincerely wish for your good...” dounia did not reply.
0xd8227edbeecc567c69c691a090806a0f2d90c424 her resolution had been taken.
0x9ca022b9c46a2546b2932c0e48de2919363da9c1 she was only awaiting the evening.
0x436428ddbcdd15d77c019831608fab6a18d2ab2d “then what is your decision, rodya?”
0x088c9e8a9c5f691c1bc79f909c0e443bc72c690b asked pulcheria alexandrovna, who was more uneasy than ever at the sudden, new businesslike tone of his talk.
0x55fcc03d917ff0e6e7251a5776cb8814c808d267 “what decision?”
0x334a439c30e8839d736bc40d6a3bbf4c831d3f63 “you see pyotr petrovitch writes that you are not to be with us this evening, and that he will go away if you come.
0x4670aa6460399e8582ba14e87ea1b6b9a1b98075 so will you... come?”
0x78b57b11ec466427e8a50c572f70bbc5bd055900 “that, of course, is not for me to decide, but for you first, if you are not offended by such a request; and secondly, by dounia, if she, too, is not offended.
0xc958a569fae24acb7b213c0dd07a0ddfe057c13a i will do what you think best,” he added, drily.
0x3e558403380b26f49c4983883f682b426aaa7d80 “dounia has already decided, and i fully agree with her,” pulcheria alexandrovna hastened to declare.
0x105b3e003b71bcc7a99613866549a7a7bbe51ae8 “i decided to ask you, rodya, to urge you not to fail to be with us at this interview,” said dounia.
0x10f87a5bc53d0ebce8fa554d1b1e3422d560ab17 “will you come?”
0xa00f66ccca0a0d5e24a747fa3544a07776ae36a4 “yes.”
0xd5795944cfc0ba2516a410dd8039f974c3e247b7 “i will ask you, too, to be with us at eight o’clock,” she said, addressing razumihin.
0x55a0b1b625fe0540218fac5e4d8341b0e0f58d39 “mother, i am inviting him, too.”
0xf3395e7cd8daad9c4a1e709c22b056ba7f859253 “quite right, dounia.
0x49a75697f772e3c1fd1592f7fa5c1c284cfa755f well, since you have decided,” added pulcheria alexandrovna, “so be it.
0x1ca070c2bcf856fc12e6f36a2a1013b9fa15e305 i shall feel easier myself.
0x5606d20f194dffac32cf15b44dde743c484d3b4d i do not like concealment and deception.
0x0175bafc6277e099ce6ba85b06849f4fed18ab7f better let us have the whole truth.... pyotr petrovitch may be angry or not, now!”
0xfef45b9b7f0d1bb9de25432ebee813a7290eab8f chapter iv at that moment the door was softly opened, and a young girl walked into the room, looking timidly about her.
0x37455505badc456fcd5bb48b3abb88ba6125e466 everyone turned towards her with surprise and curiosity.
0xbefcbfb7765cd6b54522aec83fcc1079ca865398 at first sight, raskolnikov did not recognise her.
0x72f839062832fd4b8cfcc87c340cef6ad8734495 it was sofya semyonovna marmeladov.
0xc1d8adc1733d740b3adce501550278b1ff9b4859 he had seen her yesterday for the first time, but at such a moment, in such surroundings and in such a dress, that his memory retained a very different image of her.
0xd88f2f06bdbe3fc17d8702c7db0013e8749eb66f now she was a modestly and poorly-dressed young girl, very young, indeed, almost like a child, with a modest and refined manner, with a candid but somewhat frightened-looking face.
0x8f6b3d57a614454fc5a2e791d48f702c24909d38 she was wearing a very plain indoor dress, and had on a shabby old-fashioned hat, but she still carried a parasol.
0xa45bb5284f01506b629b1f5f8c9e5a661e66bc96 unexpectedly finding the room full of people, she was not so much embarrassed as completely overwhelmed with shyness, like a little child.
0xd705c893056d3c046335d0fbe717bf0021503672 she was even about to retreat.
0xae16ca21784d5d78138cfd307a563bbd14b04546 “oh... it’s you!”
0xf6a6febe286c55d7569c256161896c46f4830b68 said raskolnikov, extremely astonished, and he, too, was confused.
0xc58ea21eab8245acdd356aff7b0bf5823c7c3b1d he at once recollected that his mother and sister knew through luzhin’s letter of “some young woman of notorious behaviour.”
0x440fe8a65970711bfec0d3c8b29ad8c10c9dfb8c he had only just been protesting against luzhin’s calumny and declaring that he had seen the girl last night for the first time, and suddenly she had walked in.
0x4a170c77a57704a62ce1b57be694ad651aec0b2c he remembered, too, that he had not protested against the expression “of notorious behaviour.”
0x1b453ebd08cd6ab8adbd3a83accab0bbfc311a0b all this passed vaguely and fleetingly through his brain, but looking at her more intently, he saw that the humiliated creature was so humiliated that he felt suddenly sorry for her.
0x2d57b800dd885c5b57b1d792d2e61dcf84c642fd when she made a movement to retreat in terror, it sent a pang to his heart.
0xc789825373b345d4f93b49a4cdd76f1c8c26fce5 “i did not expect you,” he said, hurriedly, with a look that made her stop.
0xe58a5344e734d22eee1ca5c6f6bd0431ace63cc7 “please sit down.
0xdc5363e4b381914177dfd7c61762328f6dc1610d you come, no doubt, from katerina ivanovna.
0x421002c1a0e4a74ca7dfb35df3791e2de97eb428 allow me--not there.
0xad7df0f3a833e7964cefa2b39aca8f623492d03b sit here....” at sonia’s entrance, razumihin, who had been sitting on one of raskolnikov’s three chairs, close to the door, got up to allow her to enter.
0x501a07596356f86eb7548f9799ccd4c044dd1f98 raskolnikov had at first shown her the place on the sofa where zossimov had been sitting, but feeling that the sofa which served him as a bed, was too _familiar_ a place, he hurriedly motioned her to razumihin’s chair.
0xba87e2f2a8740835941902c5300c51b74dfe35bd “you sit here,” he said to razumihin, putting him on the sofa.
0x56f590234586757d838660b9df8d0753160f1220 sonia sat down, almost shaking with terror, and looked timidly at the two ladies.
0x483a24abeedad273ec4cc104b53af32e21bf84e7 it was evidently almost inconceivable to herself that she could sit down beside them.
0x9ae9bfe0e8e2443e62de5efe634fd74c75a22885 at the thought of it, she was so frightened that she hurriedly got up again, and in utter confusion addressed raskolnikov.
0x3bbf763017f534de2f3521f6366b610995f7a7d1 “i... i... have come for one minute.
0x111ee57ca854f07dde8cd10c3b124a3ec248a8ea forgive me for disturbing you,” she began falteringly.
0x51ecf79e5b6c249c1af3e71854441211e1b81851 “i come from katerina ivanovna, and she had no one to send.
0xe1394f619e1bc0ea0d2a0c4261182810f17d4ef1 katerina ivanovna told me to beg you... to be at the service... in the morning... at mitrofanievsky... and then... to us... to her... to do her the honour... she told me to beg you...” sonia stammered and ceased speaking.
0x96a2011df9045c80db628a456b7f7221dc8495f3 “i will try, certainly, most certainly,” answered raskolnikov.
0x472e35583c2bc30575db1d077fe552c90c0a2797 he, too, stood up, and he, too, faltered and could not finish his sentence.
0xc19654e2a54c454e6ccad072def33a3dde226e55 “please sit down,” he said, suddenly.
0xf387fd1db6b88eea6eff224dd0603bda4d52155d “i want to talk to you.
0xf888f81fc1d0b7fe9c1bb186c6a4b37403789061 you are perhaps in a hurry, but please, be so kind, spare me two minutes,” and he drew up a chair for her.
0x592802ba57def5b9285c3a0346e50242d3ef8cc8 sonia sat down again, and again timidly she took a hurried, frightened look at the two ladies, and dropped her eyes.
0x11525b745e355b8e0846d75d2c78053a4019be1b raskolnikov’s pale face flushed, a shudder passed over him, his eyes glowed.
0xa49206b16d3d2acbf17f216d997377dcd19b6428 “mother,” he said, firmly and insistently, “this is sofya semyonovna marmeladov, the daughter of that unfortunate mr. marmeladov, who was run over yesterday before my eyes, and of whom i was just telling you.”
0xea2ff9994c8d76eb6c84c248faa115bd730a8155 pulcheria alexandrovna glanced at sonia, and slightly screwed up her eyes.
0x1df9f8190c7b503190960266b7d039fce415b529 in spite of her embarrassment before rodya’s urgent and challenging look, she could not deny herself that satisfaction.
0x75cf40431a4b4351fc21d7609158b39246e8fff6 dounia gazed gravely and intently into the poor girl’s face, and scrutinised her with perplexity.
0x9a6ce88a95dda7d2410ac35c88c7a8c0c2f76721 sonia, hearing herself introduced, tried to raise her eyes again, but was more embarrassed than ever.
0x1a0729278417d7a7ffd34133b4da86a6e412183b “i wanted to ask you,” said raskolnikov, hastily, “how things were arranged yesterday.
0xac59b5341f037fef9cf9bd513afb239e50886a07 you were not worried by the police, for instance?”
0xb19e1aa1f207533df7b1cfcd99ee718ec1a1cd8b “no, that was all right... it was too evident, the cause of death... they did not worry us... only the lodgers are angry.”
0x59b94e8316619c3973deecdf49dfca0f1d3c680c “why?”
0x812c58409311a22cdd0c5891db96c9d5c0aa626f “at the body’s remaining so long.
0xc2fd1e91e73ca9897f62dcba5a90db7f44d08b73 you see it is hot now.
0x2e1319dc4641ec78d6735f093e79a172a08c30dd so that, to-day, they will carry it to the cemetery, into the chapel, until to-morrow.
0x3b549189dbe63ebf3b5967e9623cee8964d67155 at first katerina ivanovna was unwilling, but now she sees herself that it’s necessary...” “to-day, then?”
0x3e3aa38e656076f25405d6c4bcb6db1899857e27 “she begs you to do us the honour to be in the church to-morrow for the service, and then to be present at the funeral lunch.”
0xa2978ba7f81efaec791c5bc26e473dcece0bae7f “she is giving a funeral lunch?”
0x1e202a7ef98bdfea6d818ab33ee1c7bd9b0c109f “yes... just a little.... she told me to thank you very much for helping us yesterday.
0x46244f5b8d33d2a014017b2336600336a7ee50c7 but for you, we should have had nothing for the funeral.”
0x9c8581963e3f0898e608b95c3e96c890b190ead1 all at once her lips and chin began trembling, but, with an effort, she controlled herself, looking down again.
0x3d38d1ad91dada6a1472b33af0f165797a32352b during the conversation, raskolnikov watched her carefully.
0x54d44b16f8fe9b14901840d055c1199dd199279e she had a thin, very thin, pale little face, rather irregular and angular, with a sharp little nose and chin.
0xffb57d32d059ae3f5aa9e9e750ab60f319c2c547 she could not have been called pretty, but her blue eyes were so clear, and when they lighted up, there was such a kindliness and simplicity in her expression that one could not help being attracted.
0xde383b97fdfe1bc490593d343e02b6f40e79a62a her face, and her whole figure indeed, had another peculiar characteristic.
0xb3cc7b40fe18c60adb18abf9f226814fd909b494 in spite of her eighteen years, she looked almost a little girl--almost a child.
0xaa9a4d60fc5d7b488e3e7dee2fc2e448fc1e5510 and in some of her gestures, this childishness seemed almost absurd.
0x39ed5a44961001258e98fcb0f29ef376cf24e6ff “but has katerina ivanovna been able to manage with such small means?
0xc290594c321bfbd685a54d39ff907c03667fad7b does she even mean to have a funeral lunch?”
0x01b81647d47019d4b4ad4993c0a7e4c8f263cdeb raskolnikov asked, persistently keeping up the conversation.
0x85ba420687f31f1b519e266add1d18b273125227 “the coffin will be plain, of course... and everything will be plain, so it won’t cost much.
0x7c04ba1f58ff4a8849ae163d490ebe26f57745e7 katerina ivanovna and i have reckoned it all out, so that there will be enough left... and katerina ivanovna was very anxious it should be so.
0xd79b3be9c7797bd2ccd3b337f89634f644d45d3a you know one can’t... it’s a comfort to her... she is like that, you know....” “i understand, i understand... of course... why do you look at my room like that?
0xcf6cb7aba29dafd6ad96127606ce00ebaedecb4e my mother has just said it is like a tomb.”
0xf651e82e50807233054a757be4344dbcf4b11afc “you gave us everything yesterday,” sonia said suddenly, in reply, in a loud rapid whisper; and again she looked down in confusion.
0xd9f92fbd85a4335fb09a1801f5ec056e3f30e0c9 her lips and chin were trembling once more.
0xc6a21e7a8c62fe5becea3eec3f48a2bd835665fb she had been struck at once by raskolnikov’s poor surroundings, and now these words broke out spontaneously.
0x96e6f246252368336ab5424e3e548bf9b931b60a a silence followed.
0x6682250a4eb3f84ae4b0583d05f4a29a27ab0056 there was a light in dounia’s eyes, and even pulcheria alexandrovna looked kindly at sonia.
0xe5dd70a582a4f7a52971b727ed1fb362b5e00ee7 “rodya,” she said, getting up, “we shall have dinner together, of course.
0xdf1a6989f74338358956cbc9be20667f6edd9fb6 come, dounia.... and you, rodya, had better go for a little walk, and then rest and lie down before you come to see us.... i am afraid we have exhausted you....” “yes, yes, i’ll come,” he answered, getting up fussily.
0xd288caf5be6a743dcdea1fc871f858bb3adbb06d “but i have something to see to.”
0x9faf7e2cedae6da02da9af97672eb73da4765ffb “but surely you will have dinner together?”
0x45b6b1d86235d6041a3b47fa228849d323f9ca77 cried razumihin, looking in surprise at raskolnikov.
0xbf88212b1ff5a8b9eaea9de92afa0c41e4b69ed7 “what do you mean?”
0xebc221aaa5c5a47c2c1e6068b4ccbe4d8686dfb5 “yes, yes, i am coming... of course, of course!
0x92f2e791ca281f93c0a89e965f370f1b36347e17 and you stay a minute.
0xfb009c106bdc62868c7849053af94d3ddd2a860e you do not want him just now, do you, mother?
0x64a72741f0e0a4b7958405ff7845004b2929b117 or perhaps i am taking him from you?”
0xe702e5d2f974b62edec903af320edbc9a9554279 “oh, no, no. and will you, dmitri prokofitch, do us the favour of dining with us?”
0x499b3293d44bf56e28d9c0a02a8ca75e9fc78ef6 “please do,” added dounia.
0xe67dd8371f2b01ac9c349d06a5f5bde16f99d2d8 razumihin bowed, positively radiant.
0xb459c3aa4d16825ede44a044e3914585310e18b6 for one moment, they were all strangely embarrassed.
0xd0283adc216a9ab7ade41ecde50a14661fb69c0f “good-bye, rodya, that is till we meet.
0x3554a9325005acaad6d9c80647ed4db9f58e316c i do not like saying good-bye.
0x6f0a11b80a076087f70dea879c11dc0e90104704 good-bye, nastasya.
0x32f591dc13ce413fbee419c684bd68461d8c8286 ah, i have said good-bye again.”
0xbbcc1f1ebc10c084b50e2c0c765004b7a2533686 pulcheria alexandrovna meant to greet sonia, too; but it somehow failed to come off, and she went in a flutter out of the room.
0xdfa9c973d7b4f8c8035c7150f4ddbdd19a60e77e but avdotya romanovna seemed to await her turn, and following her mother out, gave sonia an attentive, courteous bow.
0xeb6bc386c15bd22d4d98f80759c029d40155399a sonia, in confusion, gave a hurried, frightened curtsy.
0xfa0afdacaa35c82c9bf45148880607dd435b9712 there was a look of poignant discomfort in her face, as though avdotya romanovna’s courtesy and attention were oppressive and painful to her.
0xa267880471b55087fcd2dc9f2d73fb3b6ea80165 “dounia, good-bye,” called raskolnikov, in the passage.
0x383345d7bf5cd762fe691f032d197a012e9239a5 “give me your hand.”
0x483ded2cefe1ea3e4e6e5b85a60a1c944a623b5e “why, i did give it to you.
0x61d399cae927e9e6dcb6d5acafc30a94b979e2b6 have you forgotten?”
0xeef5d979af5f6df6ec4961c6b0607c1a1cf7eede said dounia, turning warmly and awkwardly to him.
0x21ea1bf843f3789fe6a617a6e9711da965d48c79 “never mind, give it to me again.”
0xf439a8151c3153817f66376f493f5180f27a3369 and he squeezed her fingers warmly.
0x4f5267aa4b7ae2bec26fef086897cc360ee27ce8 dounia smiled, flushed, pulled her hand away, and went off quite happy.
0x3fec0bc8d68a2c3058d42e7425a99f7f8126c930 “come, that’s capital,” he said to sonia, going back and looking brightly at her.
0x38f9782a919ebc0ab0a4b0c4db5d7a3cb838f4cb “god give peace to the dead, the living have still to live.
0x41b20d632fb70b8357b8b664c210827efbda3531 that is right, isn’t it?”
0xd222643b31cec1d98a756b96f941916efd23c0b2 sonia looked surprised at the sudden brightness of his face.
0xdd57825c30898114df588a71856258dbbcd76377 he looked at her for some moments in silence.
0xcaed772fc67d5343cc67d6e96a022869cf74a050 the whole history of the dead father floated before his memory in those moments.... ***** “heavens, dounia,” pulcheria alexandrovna began, as soon as they were in the street, “i really feel relieved myself at coming away--more at ease.
0x448ae948cefa03adc9917c9a83baacb8bba9f1d1 how little did i think yesterday in the train that i could ever be glad of that.”
0x90b38e568ab97bf7cdcb0a030c13f86155589cc2 “i tell you again, mother, he is still very ill. don’t you see it?
0x756e19e05d916e4848a8cda2070336df660c413a perhaps worrying about us upset him.
0x3da25e9dbd7836086d8578edb15cd6c4aa1ce32f we must be patient, and much, much can be forgiven.”
0x9a82136953fe821b7487fafab546a650fe380ee7 “well, you were not very patient!”
0x42eea0d8262de20ed0925fb176be2dba6d2941b2 pulcheria alexandrovna caught her up, hotly and jealously.
0x6a95516620a7397959c5035bf11ae10aeab7f439 “do you know, dounia, i was looking at you two.
0x28d5530d3856190cf3a7e498a066fe77aff57942 you are the very portrait of him, and not so much in face as in soul.
0x22bbe1f38a6143eb3490fa0cc5a70ba5a5ab22d7 you are both melancholy, both morose and hot-tempered, both haughty and both generous.... surely he can’t be an egoist, dounia.
0x303a28a4341840da3e8b64d15c45361a8383db65 eh?
0x6caca949cec0663d07317ad005634b58c20c4412 when i think of what is in store for us this evening, my heart sinks!”
0xf3ec15efbac141808eb01344e86c024b5d46bb46 “don’t be uneasy, mother.
0x91562e9d0937267beebc2d514d569557bf04146f what must be, will be.”
0x8217ecc0c16c71648cec281f88bb6c1d3df1afa1 “dounia, only think what a position we are in!
0x8c379d1f477303e10cc8f51a7e1bf8d25c194952 what if pyotr petrovitch breaks it off?”
0xef84dd55870d06a7575361a862d385d0166b5f6a poor pulcheria alexandrovna blurted out, incautiously.
0x9aca57dd9ac9aa73229d03ce54ba607a4bab2c72 “he won’t be worth much if he does,” answered dounia, sharply and contemptuously.
0xca9f1c9faac06abf8d59a6c6843a0aa922985a4c “we did well to come away,” pulcheria alexandrovna hurriedly broke in.
0xb2148f6012d26678590c2def44579517700f2493 “he was in a hurry about some business or other.
0x20c9d831965ec2cfa4496ac15f872e0bcfb644db if he gets out and has a breath of air... it is fearfully close in his room.... but where is one to get a breath of air here?
0x35b5be9e776b4c9e7baeaaa115237f100350de13 the very streets here feel like shut-up rooms.
0xd2ada9e319d064236af52b349e351cb101549caa good heavens!
0x074e3b85b2b78f3c65405e25af18239a65984700 what a town!... stay... this side... they will crush you--carrying something.
0x37960a92a93ff6863dfb7360d3fc4fd19711315c why, it is a piano they have got, i declare... how they push!... i am very much afraid of that young woman, too.”
0xb290e0ec5fdf46e40336fba33189c53b1ff0332c “what young woman, mother?
0x12816b14cb101d64e89336e9f49890ec74c83f6c “why, that sofya semyonovna, who was there just now.”
0x59b94e8316619c3973deecdf49dfca0f1d3c680c “why?”
0x8577aa9e27f4a00fda309d5bfb415bcb66f37119 “i have a presentiment, dounia.
0x2fd9d1d75d43e8f506fe7bce84a6d409743df2ba well, you may believe it or not, but as soon as she came in, that very minute, i felt that she was the chief cause of the trouble....” “nothing of the sort!”
0xc5ae3dcf00cb96b0668ad748a75c0857c4d48f76 cried dounia, in vexation.
0xb2d4a8c945b8046bb4e22072b98cd69445aa93d7 “what nonsense, with your presentiments, mother!
0x153af6ee2da796c03f3c8d59fa3ca17b1e0138aa he only made her acquaintance the evening before, and he did not know her when she came in.”
0x0678de1ebc485a387ddb08336490b1d05ff5de45 “well, you will see.... she worries me; but you will see, you will see!
0x559be28febd4b18945ea7c224138c91a78e74c89 i was so frightened.
0xc458e7fcb0efaaad78c9d0fdbda0ee52be347147 she was gazing at me with those eyes.
0xe0f3fcbbdef59ed202fe0d970f9c9198464b1c0e i could scarcely sit still in my chair when he began introducing her, do you remember?
0x6213803c3d27d76c2b49e7b4e1010cc4488af15d it seems so strange, but pyotr petrovitch writes like that about her, and he introduces her to us--to you!
0x816d7954cb67f27555d592eda5f7fbc041eed75c so he must think a great deal of her.”
0xfe2065edcafa012482e2b96defacac608ab7dc56 “people will write anything.
0xbd27914977aea8c3744ad95faca075a576b17415 we were talked about and written about, too.
0xe85a35687d1485b35e66c540cfe527ff53ff6d92 have you forgotten?
0x7712083de84eb25c70de8b3717fbebcc8db0f8ec i am sure that she is a good girl, and that it is all nonsense.”
0x03410c750b0d2ff7687fdd7eeb4e53d5a7d97c60 “god grant it may be!”
0x6b3465f8614b6fb6c313d4d6ec051a92ff8108f6 “and pyotr petrovitch is a contemptible slanderer,” dounia snapped out, suddenly.
0xf8552047869f4912cc445c28e11df1b7d74f8673 pulcheria alexandrovna was crushed; the conversation was not resumed.
0xf03e6356a68d062de991c025738a3ab6eaaa4503 ***** “i will tell you what i want with you,” said raskolnikov, drawing razumihin to the window.
0x973d38404ebef86cb755609c0f1d0f0bea2497ab “then i will tell katerina ivanovna that you are coming,” sonia said hurriedly, preparing to depart.
0xa6458cc108b47a7500ef356227ba4833bebd98d3 “one minute, sofya semyonovna.
0xb34b39414f56baaf9760349a88a936bbcc2e2f65 we have no secrets.
0x208e3b7b65c864742598f3567ef7ca38d1004b90 you are not in our way.
0xd66bb162d929076a4d7150a076e84c00bbc8676b i want to have another word or two with you.
0xbfa9fc5fedb068805b97990568eea083ad521dd5 listen!”
0xa02198c694e8d6adc617c77d5ff788d71e967caa he turned suddenly to razumihin again.
0xb3127fd4c856cfc5ed955a5d997a58a426ae20fd “you know that... what’s his name... porfiry petrovitch?”
0x6f9d465f50bb6ab6f0d8e3053e17a4631c73b317 “i should think so!
0x670c610b127c21a6e91bba372d42c2a281d43cb8 he is a relation.
0x9d2d308f9dd3c36583792d0b7012e4f511b13634 why?”
0xaac7ad9bf1083eb392172bee1a1e136d01bac10d added the latter, with interest.
0x55f09d10bd0fcfd7b7976cc0ed5d7454f28fb815 “is not he managing that case... you know, about that murder?... you were speaking about it yesterday.”
0x4e53e31b814438fa576e1d2c727f9b6024713fed “yes... well?”
0xb44acd6660bfaf66c249cd183368466f0cdb40f1 razumihin’s eyes opened wide.
0x6480cb4df2b63e51af756c6f705f2ff63ee46be3 “he was inquiring for people who had pawned things, and i have some pledges there, too--trifles--a ring my sister gave me as a keepsake when i left home, and my father’s silver watch--they are only worth five or six roubles altogether... but i value them.
0x0ebc22823c51b0024477ba1bde67355551af4e6b so what am i to do now?
0x439c337927960321fdd8604b51629df05aa01426 i do not want to lose the things, especially the watch.
0xeaf5e9e725888ccdda079d4e9c43243b76bef471 i was quaking just now, for fear mother would ask to look at it, when we spoke of dounia’s watch.
0xea42caf839b4ee8f054f6f206bea914524873d94 it is the only thing of father’s left us.
0x2a8bf1f71be35b4b89fc87f4aa0a60853a93813d she would be ill if it were lost.
0x96e8b0aa4550411421758ebab8cd4def8ed329ac you know what women are.
0x21e5a200ab429fe6f1dea82c1c8cd72b13597996 so tell me what to do.
0x869ad6fecfdffdd773af08c7a7306061a764c183 i know i ought to have given notice at the police station, but would it not be better to go straight to porfiry?
0x303a28a4341840da3e8b64d15c45361a8383db65 eh?
0xb701e245e0265c11b571739988b7f4f2f4f9389a what do you think?
0x91438a81a1d2e5b58051905b6369429a0e81f23e the matter might be settled more quickly.
0x090a674b2fc9ac3608f36419825ac2fb136dae51 you see, mother may ask for it before dinner.”
0x50e6a7534c38e90ff67a9f06a8cb44d4b778c28b “certainly not to the police station.
0x48dc07cd97286be17983fff85477cc02fd5bee32 certainly to porfiry,” razumihin shouted in extraordinary excitement.
0x17f1c68256cf37e6dc18788ba664542a56956d03 “well, how glad i am.
0x79339676f7e37efaf128a0c87339d2d4628ec6cc let us go at once.
0xad319a452a558bf0ce4c6887b6921a05c470efa4 it is a couple of steps.
0x1acf4f74a0dbc874f8fde376e1b5ab57d3373f76 we shall be sure to find him.”
0xe0bea629671f84591d66d5170bacb535d5704c9f “very well, let us go.”
0x9fd900d088601ca4258dd1f1c39e37fde2d87cf8 “and he will be very, very glad to make your acquaintance.
0x0aba773c0aef7006492c6aaee6a1274049348a4e i have often talked to him of you at different times.
0xed7bb7f625206f54712e8fdbd23f10a09bc3094e i was speaking of you yesterday.
0x6079704c4f3803daf8c40658b1724560bf5087cd let us go.
0xcc636952f4c81b31480fd661ea6237513e13237f so you knew the old woman?
0x53dc15d8734b631d87addf77c1bef9fed2ba1257 so that’s it!
0x2a90d81c00472230ae78ddd5c75cdc6a7f6884b6 it is all turning out splendidly.... oh, yes, sofya ivanovna...” “sofya semyonovna,” corrected raskolnikov.
0x2dab8618f332a273c56fcb73085c5680d8742eca “sofya semyonovna, this is my friend razumihin, and he is a good man.”
0xaccc39baf4c8669878d3cc11b3206ec8e60ca085 “if you have to go now,” sonia was beginning, not looking at razumihin at all, and still more embarrassed.
0xdc77c8abe52a42515623e845e9a120ce5af21759 “let us go,” decided raskolnikov.
0xde747afa652be01779702005731924e906f31d2b “i will come to you to-day, sofya semyonovna.
0x6adafb1adda585a058433e64e835fb777a25855f only tell me where you live.”
0x1b2ee6c79ca0acc45b060f1b9c38391232ef6598 he was not exactly ill at ease, but seemed hurried, and avoided her eyes.
0x12a56c943fdc4b1db9f8d351ce0dad44bab04ce7 sonia gave her address, and flushed as she did so.
0xde85e54ad80707456f19697f786e03d8c6c17444 they all went out together.
0x29f0398486bca8e04ee105efa04c8c5a7ed70b61 “don’t you lock up?”
0x97db74f38a35a824e7c663530292e51cc50b7b0b asked razumihin, following him on to the stairs.
0xe145429e586518edf035af02b096588170efb6cf “never,” answered raskolnikov.
0xf8aef09291e3a7c24cbed0b244c27430cd07e9e4 “i have been meaning to buy a lock for these two years.
0x558808e88070899e5499a36450882ef1b10c85ab people are happy who have no need of locks,” he said, laughing, to sonia.
0x05081648c5f0c544c39251b7be0f9404d4fda5b4 they stood still in the gateway.
0xd7d676e19c71be4e52e4496a4ca9cb8d30db7d7a “do you go to the right, sofya semyonovna?
0xfd67cb9865163d05d6f9c7f3359e3612c15d9dd1 how did you find me, by the way?”
0xdf5b192fb4a157c7c5891befac04f77ab3630f9c he added, as though he wanted to say something quite different.
0xbb5fbc6afbdb003fba75c1a825a4c5ae9e8c0d7e he wanted to look at her soft clear eyes, but this was not easy.
0xac9827151806e30ced6cc5e961f79ad1bb98683a “why, you gave your address to polenka yesterday.”
0x14b658dc52dbf81d3670da50f894f9af3ad19d38 “polenka?
0x3ddcf11603df43307e4a7ec4b6aacba11009d260 oh, yes; polenka, that is the little girl.
0x81229b5d7538c4288ea282b4713f3487f7ddcefd she is your sister?
0x301accb330b267cc033a27677db409221c9b7883 did i give her the address?”
0xe4a634ab24be9232c2e7ab3216bf987d1c4dfa89 “why, had you forgotten?”
0x746715e699a979cf09eefd06e00dd27d4eb7c7e3 “no, i remember.”
0xac0367e3e4fabab07d8b913c06df90547627e7cf “i had heard my father speak of you... only i did not know your name, and he did not know it.
0x870261cfcadddad39e409df79bca829cbec9e6dd and now i came... and as i had learnt your name, i asked to-day, ‘where does mr. raskolnikov live?’
0xf26785a749a16750f1b50ed9cae8527d052e395c i did not know you had only a room too.... good-bye, i will tell katerina ivanovna.”
0x4ab9848e664f6f5227c44f9db702294fb08bc72f she was extremely glad to escape at last; she went away looking down, hurrying to get out of sight as soon as possible, to walk the twenty steps to the turning on the right and to be at last alone, and then moving rapidly along, looking at no one, noticing nothing, to think, to remember, to meditate on every word, every detail.
0x3413c40324f76fe86bb1e664e06927e0bcfc2b55 never, never had she felt anything like this.
0x191a861fbd8c61813a21318e19d0980277408068 dimly and unconsciously a whole new world was opening before her.
0x78109e8d870c639de2137649814b420eaa43f8ff she remembered suddenly that raskolnikov meant to come to her that day, perhaps at once!
0xea7fbf4125b771803cd2ceef12e89d7ea6a4d83c “only not to-day, please, not to-day!”
0xe6f16331828d3d37263fa4c08dbff9d73ed0bd4c she kept muttering with a sinking heart, as though entreating someone, like a frightened child.
0xc15f93ba94aff93986b9fe33688b9d40cc21fd1a “mercy!
0x5c1e0c01afee61156a2b219eeb34f91fac235d24 to me... to that room... he will see... oh, dear!”
0xb9ea2531baa11a67c5e1ef55b2f9af4476a4dd3e she was not capable at that instant of noticing an unknown gentleman who was watching her and following at her heels.
0xbabe039b37b4047af99d9380fe17ff866b3651e5 he had accompanied her from the gateway.
0xac7d44aaf25ca9802cb5c41269a8838d554f15a9 at the moment when razumihin, raskolnikov, and she stood still at parting on the pavement, this gentleman, who was just passing, started on hearing sonia’s words: “and i asked where mr. raskolnikov lived?”
0xb1516f17607b928125c2d4d2d2ed22211e1e89d0 he turned a rapid but attentive look upon all three, especially upon raskolnikov, to whom sonia was speaking; then looked back and noted the house.
0x3ac37d46a7b53259139341dbab77bd6b2219f4fc all this was done in an instant as he passed, and trying not to betray his interest, he walked on more slowly as though waiting for something.
0xb46a9a0c669713990a7fd495864b49cf68e08d26 he was waiting for sonia; he saw that they were parting, and that sonia was going home.
0xf2192184521778783f71b00350c879070a3fdec3 “home?
0x4bfc973915b15c34d41266101ffd5292e6935cd7 where?
0x07f68098ce4c93e1b887b25a1f8d448f1620b6c0 i’ve seen that face somewhere,” he thought.
0xd9fc569c3d7b89a0de31ab19612a656d8738bcef “i must find out.”
0x180a0e9e214c4593572bace050e2ffd548a81261 at the turning he crossed over, looked round, and saw sonia coming the same way, noticing nothing.
0x2586cd09d268f5e174a39d5b5892cff6b3ebbb7b she turned the corner.
0xf716791a9d6266f75982ad240b2a7da76eb51171 he followed her on the other side.
0xf5730a757f84c5675e0693cbeda95423e687c256 after about fifty paces he crossed over again, overtook her and kept two or three yards behind her.
0x7ddddd47619cffe983a881f5b72c89d11ee01c4d he was a man about fifty, rather tall and thickly set, with broad high shoulders which made him look as though he stooped a little.
0x5da42b68ec6147c39ec9db4dacc9b8d271faaee8 he wore good and fashionable clothes, and looked like a gentleman of position.
0x4e300fbdecfc8801bcedae943d42f9908477cc67 he carried a handsome cane, which he tapped on the pavement at each step; his gloves were spotless.
0x8486e9ca90d6520d97e5c88d913c4387f98646dd he had a broad, rather pleasant face with high cheek-bones and a fresh colour, not often seen in petersburg.
0x2b4fc1a54e048644c736c6d5222df41f985df620 his flaxen hair was still abundant, and only touched here and there with grey, and his thick square beard was even lighter than his hair.
0x1f782355152c9874a2960360d9b82e1735d94208 his eyes were blue and had a cold and thoughtful look; his lips were crimson.
0x1e2c66c5981daa88c5baadf9824723fea2ed1d3b he was a remarkedly well-preserved man and looked much younger than his years.
0xe1afc3dcfe9b8bfdb1dda567d4fe9587d9216c2d when sonia came out on the canal bank, they were the only two persons on the pavement.
0x7327bd89fd86c9b443131a0b1e745746f425a19e he observed her dreaminess and preoccupation.
0x35a7a1e60a87124fe9053b8195fa08b748fb44a5 on reaching the house where she lodged, sonia turned in at the gate; he followed her, seeming rather surprised.
0xa0f6e0eae05a0c3f7254d9a812dbecb8ed2191a9 in the courtyard she turned to the right corner.
0x7cdf4195e6dad9ee9cf92383de99e23c66822570 “bah!”
0x40630a4f95e384e892ce16791873a711fd2f33e2 muttered the unknown gentleman, and mounted the stairs behind her.
0x576e77d554e1b3838c4eebc8b481cf3c25209f08 only then sonia noticed him.
0x71b8193e5341458a7128412ccf39a75793ba2c9d she reached the third storey, turned down the passage, and rang at no. 9. on the door was inscribed in chalk, “kapernaumov, tailor.”
0x7cdf4195e6dad9ee9cf92383de99e23c66822570 “bah!”
0x204b0e8c0a32bff97f4143566752dc53ff5e2a42 the stranger repeated again, wondering at the strange coincidence, and he rang next door, at no. 8. the doors were two or three yards apart.
0xb722f8127b07bf45b4e0fca650cd6d1c388f8fe3 “you lodge at kapernaumov’s,” he said, looking at sonia and laughing.
0x14c8f3888295a6a6b670130bcf90a0ab0d18e634 “he altered a waistcoat for me yesterday.
0x2ba6cf27107a9480716d0421263b8ba9a7d4562a i am staying close here at madame resslich’s.
0xf500438e178a125f765d0493c54654df5ad57d20 how odd!”
0x08186bcd57785becc4595626c0a55f8e6eefccf3 sonia looked at him attentively.
0xbae8fd7a97ea8d442fe3249fdf28a17a8fe56453 “we are neighbours,” he went on gaily.
0xd01945368a6144e23e48754fb9f7a03ef1781e5b “i only came to town the day before yesterday.

0x6612b290f95df4bb9077e6be9ddae032d86ada94 sonia made no reply; the door opened and she slipped in.
0x8b2bdeafe657b43133d7740f2a78093d4e91e22e she felt for some reason ashamed and uneasy.
0x41603b8a62dd69a4f1177da2b8295bc0b1d7b658 ***** on the way to porfiry’s, razumihin was obviously excited.
0x21d5a49a4f6bd284ab3929d798c3756714611a76 “that’s capital, brother,” he repeated several times, “and i am glad!
0x82db8cc9b953ee60fdff2fec68fb3d8c194fa46f i am glad!”
0x919baf051085c8d9007c67931175049958b3ca47 “what are you glad about?”
0x55c0984225ac4e40aafa3eee1f29c4cf353d0e3c raskolnikov thought to himself.
0xe96fb21c9cd4e771142b06ce5a78d3caa1e2192d “i didn’t know that you pledged things at the old woman’s, too.
0xf429328a670e331f7b5898a4687460ade40a0ad4 and... was it long ago?
0x85913564d4ec689186b1f22189b075eca45e5d62 i mean, was it long since you were there?”
0xea6289632336aa55f43932edfba57a005e3b4b36 “what a simple-hearted fool he is!”
0x8a1da83a3ea793868b12f0ab99a4e26713509cb9 “when was it?”
0x663995826e25e3d1a0bf4e55eb6faebc8c27dcc8 raskolnikov stopped still to recollect.
0x99e42b1c738db241139dccbf6b56d7e47fe7af06 “two or three days before her death it must have been.
0xe80fa7c4f84f3af495b625e1aedc1004a948288c but i am not going to redeem the things now,” he put in with a sort of hurried and conspicuous solicitude about the things.
0xb412611a634aec6422bfe82c3aa3e1828bedbc2a “i’ve not more than a silver rouble left... after last night’s accursed delirium!”
0xd437256848ec783dc23472b80f7bd6ba26226be0 he laid special emphasis on the delirium.
0x38b4728221c9083991b53e7a05bdd0abf5ddda69 “yes, yes,” razumihin hastened to agree--with what was not clear.
0xe537ba2631aee0c71ea41f890ffe28c8136c7c50 “then that’s why you... were stuck... partly... you know in your delirium you were continually mentioning some rings or chains!
0xa1cc3aca463a9ee3e670beb8499e3cecad036a3b yes, yes... that’s clear, it’s all clear now.”
0xbd1c69c8c72b271c03ef6999350cd5efa2f58922 “hullo!
0xc982640a7c9abb8c118cc54cec3b1b2cbf26f058 how that idea must have got about among them.
0x4c5a0fc081b9db0822873f46f2eb883ef3a0cdc7 here this man will go to the stake for me, and i find him delighted at having it _cleared up_ why i spoke of rings in my delirium!
0x3589276bdae5ff4687f5c7fb025ef48a0a136ca5 what a hold the idea must have on all of them!”
0x709a2150278737215e2ede6d7ed41a2eaf32be2c “shall we find him?”
0x268b1c58e544f669e6d7289969fec55677d45fff he asked suddenly.
0x0cda218c09b720b7905c15d08ea5cc2f7fd68916 “oh, yes,” razumihin answered quickly.
0x292e8fd10c8c8f8342cd26e3fcb5cdf24a298bbc “he is a nice fellow, you will see, brother.
0x1149df152e9e487ee3ec8e54ecde48005f1e168d rather clumsy, that is to say, he is a man of polished manners, but i mean clumsy in a different sense.
0xf195dbaa7ab37e550455ab9da8d9212d33df7cdb he is an intelligent fellow, very much so indeed, but he has his own range of ideas.... he is incredulous, sceptical, cynical... he likes to impose on people, or rather to make fun of them.
0xdb6fca9233bd04ed38b0ebef1519ea4dfc6ead99 his is the old, circumstantial method.... but he understands his work... thoroughly.... last year he cleared up a case of murder in which the police had hardly a clue.
0x711c97b8725604afd3110fc46367122c97cf9001 he is very, very anxious to make your acquaintance!”
0xd239fee6437dcc626b0b1ce3b30718c21d7feec1 “on what grounds is he so anxious?”
0x0efe3cf89d357cbc3f28fa0916c02b75a4036572 “oh, it’s not exactly... you see, since you’ve been ill i happen to have mentioned you several times.... so, when he heard about you... about your being a law student and not able to finish your studies, he said, ‘what a pity!’
0x4cc971021ae7c81d2d442324e782a07956764154 and so i concluded... from everything together, not only that; yesterday zametov... you know, rodya, i talked some nonsense on the way home to you yesterday, when i was drunk... i am afraid, brother, of your exaggerating it, you see.”
0xd925ce5fccd34b0b9314565227fa1f35fbe7007c “what?
0x79bbf90f56c7b8640cbc5850473015632a0514c0 that they think i am a madman?
0x6f4ce3ee11e739ffdf7a88bc9071db29f42a2b0a maybe they are right,” he said with a constrained smile.
0xd5b3d58f07b6e2218bd5bdf597f5f42d2e72157b “yes, yes.... that is, pooh, no!... but all that i said (and there was something else too) it was all nonsense, drunken nonsense.”
0x0127d690e80ea531c6748375ecf4b2396c9aedc5 “but why are you apologising?
0x28f6d0705c32959f3bd449bcba529fafaccab4be i am so sick of it all!”
0x6227f0bf05b5ec09052e6fc8e55d860484be3abb raskolnikov cried with exaggerated irritability.
0x8adc30b8ba8d121ff5246e06a020a51229541fc7 it was partly assumed, however.
0xb97b603805a5c36f19ba06d389861fafa49f3473 “i know, i know, i understand.
0xb86224b483b72af470b7efbc1987ab0a90664432 believe me, i understand.
0xb68d9f97075c984df4fc8a1113b7b36038dd68c0 one’s ashamed to speak of it.”
0x47188704a2ac1db9ae0e8459246b397c9e02a28b “if you are ashamed, then don’t speak of it.”
0xf2ab078b16bf46b96a9978cdc6896b892c15e091 both were silent.
0xb0382d45accfdfd742c1a355f2e9fba8650ba903 razumihin was more than ecstatic and raskolnikov perceived it with repulsion.
0x46b3a3d88ac5e072e0457d09784546822b661395 he was alarmed, too, by what razumihin had just said about porfiry.
0xf913e871cd603ed339aa8459f6c05581c1fe9586 “i shall have to pull a long face with him too,” he thought, with a beating heart, and he turned white, “and do it naturally, too.
0x60de07ce30e4ef4a12adc7eb6833c601b5558b7b but the most natural thing would be to do nothing at all.
0xaedae1d5a3f3f07331ec9193a17d8d9f3e6d301c carefully do nothing at all!
0x3460dd507561c4b117e6db98e61fa26926fc3708 no, _carefully_ would not be natural again.... oh, well, we shall see how it turns out.... we shall see... directly.
0x176a77b5797a35b28324a62f184223e1fabcbeac is it a good thing to go or not?

0x1cd4b52b7862326850ee225eecd9da5ea9e16939 “in this grey house,” said razumihin.
0xf887af86f67d339e23987e57db623c081d2c6418 “the most important thing, does porfiry know that i was at the old hag’s flat yesterday... and asked about the blood?
0xe8b1ee74a49ce0b4cb7970fe55430d7192667ec5 i must find that out instantly, as soon as i go in, find out from his face; otherwise... i’ll find out, if it’s my ruin.”
0xa75a2adcb029a50301615707524a9cbf0aea1414 “i say, brother,” he said suddenly, addressing razumihin, with a sly smile, “i have been noticing all day that you seem to be curiously excited.
0x2498ede62386a1e2fcc58fa0129642d938d96aa3 isn’t it so?”
0x89eca609f5d96d064b917185f6406893b84c907b “excited?
0x79df46cca3498b8fa343415eb4fe3afc599d4104 not a bit of it,” said razumihin, stung to the quick.
0x5b28eb168363258e01abcad5b18cba0b5b7a36e7 “yes, brother, i assure you it’s noticeable.
0xa210082fabed7cb42e0b284abf81f7b8c1880379 why, you sat on your chair in a way you never do sit, on the edge somehow, and you seemed to be writhing all the time.
0x141fdb35c4c9b243604da5192f30430e0ea1a6b0 you kept jumping up for nothing.
0x1aae4e5a4995028a67130d77c9d7e437183ce390 one moment you were angry, and the next your face looked like a sweetmeat.

0xeea58647b8d1fadd5a0aebb283220ca077789721 razumihin was utterly overwhelmed, turning cold with horror.

0x817dbedd8b817eeeb956900797ee82e911a665a1 raskolnikov laughed as though he could not restrain himself.
0xf3fecb84e7a0fe56d2e50d3bff5b90a58e12213d so laughing, they entered porfiry petrovitch’s flat.
0xa15aba3acb5bdf6af818182e3f14d4e6ac474f9d this is what raskolnikov wanted: from within they could be heard laughing as they came in, still guffawing in the passage.
0x174afe330d2a309162895c0410edddac60d1905a “not a word here or i’ll... brain you!”
0x570390c61eeca22da594a291e5783cebb46f076a razumihin whispered furiously, seizing raskolnikov by the shoulder.
0x4d9b86e745731ac30bd0eddf1be0a5010836ec40 chapter v raskolnikov was already entering the room.
0xfbf89ca1f00f476cea6e0c9966b4a446a7d4d50c he came in looking as though he had the utmost difficulty not to burst out laughing again.
0x20ca5cf28f59ee243e5109a1555b78eae285e036 behind him razumihin strode in gawky and awkward, shamefaced and red as a peony, with an utterly crestfallen and ferocious expression.
0xdccc8407d5dfa45f61de666576fa2e08887bbcc6 his face and whole figure really were ridiculous at that moment and amply justified raskolnikov’s laughter.
0x7f52f7fc45535b4cc7aaa9faad4bbebdce7b723d raskolnikov, not waiting for an introduction, bowed to porfiry petrovitch, who stood in the middle of the room looking inquiringly at them.
0x9e9d56ce62e503152371995ad2b55510b0cadbad he held out his hand and shook hands, still apparently making desperate efforts to subdue his mirth and utter a few words to introduce himself.
0x7f57d4dbf8ec105c88d032882cfdf09698a40d18 but he had no sooner succeeded in assuming a serious air and muttering something when he suddenly glanced again as though accidentally at razumihin, and could no longer control himself: his stifled laughter broke out the more irresistibly the more he tried to restrain it.
0x9d0e1b3d79cbd46977c003afd13eaefa3d0b2f7a the extraordinary ferocity with which razumihin received this “spontaneous” mirth gave the whole scene the appearance of most genuine fun and naturalness.
0x0c0507afb418f36c5e6967016e65c77bde15fa54 razumihin strengthened this impression as though on purpose.
0x00becac78b0abda9075c79cf8e125206bb7f06e0 “fool!
0x7e5bfcbd64c5d117de80e642c8815b150f7121f1 you fiend,” he roared, waving his arm which at once struck a little round table with an empty tea-glass on it.
0xf561283dbb4a6ec519cb7ff6c4f940dd8dd788ee everything was sent flying and crashing.
0x0a75dd2dd63bd86a6cf6bc2aefe0715f7a089f6a “but why break chairs, gentlemen?
0xaf306cf0de83a354d4ae4ad1c3c9c667cd23b1b3 you know it’s a loss to the crown,” porfiry petrovitch quoted gaily.
0x31fb10b042fcba282a6a93485d6aff59087b53cd raskolnikov was still laughing, with his hand in porfiry petrovitch’s, but anxious not to overdo it, awaited the right moment to put a natural end to it.
0xcadbbd0d194c32bd093303f910890250817e714f razumihin, completely put to confusion by upsetting the table and smashing the glass, gazed gloomily at the fragments, cursed and turned sharply to the window where he stood looking out with his back to the company with a fiercely scowling countenance, seeing nothing.
0xf55d69b3f9d964a47c462e68bc360f5d7942f90c porfiry petrovitch laughed and was ready to go on laughing, but obviously looked for explanations.
0x67d9f583db581d351528156525ba82f4189eb1e4 zametov had been sitting in the corner, but he rose at the visitors’ entrance and was standing in expectation with a smile on his lips, though he looked with surprise and even it seemed incredulity at the whole scene and at raskolnikov with a certain embarrassment.
0xe297fe98e286a1c312e4c005b1039e2d570a9b65 zametov’s unexpected presence struck raskolnikov unpleasantly.
0x76392081bcaebb3dce1482554eda6c7f39e472f5 “i’ve got to think of that,” he thought.
0x03dc7e362b6b90fc9b70067ef165ebe5ad48d444 “excuse me, please,” he began, affecting extreme embarrassment.

0xa26ad287a4f978188f7214b6163e746ec08637c7 “not at all, very pleasant to see you... and how pleasantly you’ve come in.... why, won’t he even say good-morning?”
0x9987b1f2d6d4d67d189a8c5c7700e0c406ea54c1 porfiry petrovitch nodded at razumihin.
0x397e847ebb1333a8b9322fbd9fbc4b656d56e549 “upon my honour i don’t know why he is in such a rage with me.
0xdef9c5d6b5ae393fa1a590476c980cdf7d2840fb i only told him as we came along that he was like romeo... and proved it.
0xb11ecda62c095888fff63a15f36d1ab55d6cb1ea and that was all, i think!”
0x001060481a3cf16780896c8df491465cd868f2fc “pig!”
0xfa8485ed781562bcba585bf585f4f92f3347f075 ejaculated razumihin, without turning round.
0xe35b4db34dc07fb8e453e700e109194b0c4f5803 “there must have been very grave grounds for it, if he is so furious at the word,” porfiry laughed.
0x6b3d231539f4952895467924741bbc2b83803651 “oh, you sharp lawyer!... damn you all!”
0x6b015cd50d782e9705bc5c7ff4a713adae0859db snapped razumihin, and suddenly bursting out laughing himself, he went up to porfiry with a more cheerful face as though nothing had happened.
0x873506cdb392cc44aa28bdf9ec4394921d44a6af “that’ll do!
0xbf54d6247016766f1513e44f0663af269c996374 we are all fools.
0xb69c8fa7cedba9c5e699a7635424e0b2507a79bb to come to business.
0x9a8541196beff7ba75ca294ab902b506c5761e81 this is my friend rodion romanovitch raskolnikov; in the first place he has heard of you and wants to make your acquaintance, and secondly, he has a little matter of business with you.
0x0cf87980b6ccbfa97a80c6661b8e769f1de660ef bah!
0x7e7c2a2633b77137da7f2a42924fe8fb4c49b0f9 zametov, what brought you here?
0xebe2ebfb670e7e5af96e7fc9da24db2fbbd89946 have you met before?
0x98b8c975aca5a7c4306286145a7346c41beaf46e have you known each other long?”
0xfca54d87423d4bbe2507e52df584b3f2c98aec18 “what does this mean?”
0x86f951914dc120fbbc316888be4588acb923f6ab thought raskolnikov uneasily.
0x971210941383f53d83a18e1400f6252072a6d127 zametov seemed taken aback, but not very much so.
0x79e1788e6e2ad5ccc77d38baa573a9f9aca126f4 “why, it was at your rooms we met yesterday,” he said easily.
0x6b4b5c2f66ac4ed402f94ab4c148c2a2e95d55d3 “then i have been spared the trouble.
0x34171f5249fb99095bc6c2486273accc61855c55 all last week he was begging me to introduce him to you.
0x4b1bf4f79d43ad8a037c1c8a0d71d73dc624089c porfiry and you have sniffed each other out without me.
0x8ad04ae8e977e5bd5867915f1680ea67cf1811c4 where is your tobacco?”
0x531b6cbbd356ed74f9579aef07ba57c107e63107 porfiry petrovitch was wearing a dressing-gown, very clean linen, and trodden-down slippers.
0x0ae9238f42fd3744e32e50b1654676310d26674a he was a man of about five and thirty, short, stout even to corpulence, and clean shaven.
0xe82316fda8c88f9e011f1e386965632c8566dcee he wore his hair cut short and had a large round head, particularly prominent at the back.
0xdc937845e6839619897885ae5aea2cc127a2004f his soft, round, rather snub-nosed face was of a sickly yellowish colour, but had a vigorous and rather ironical expression.
0x211125de90f04fa849c02243c6bd012b09413dfd it would have been good-natured except for a look in the eyes, which shone with a watery, mawkish light under almost white, blinking eyelashes.
0xbeed284085c595e7eb16180b7413b12f59ae1c87 the expression of those eyes was strangely out of keeping with his somewhat womanish figure, and gave it something far more serious than could be guessed at first sight.
0xa68967a732ef6c30236ca9b51d107e254d7d1dbb as soon as porfiry petrovitch heard that his visitor had a little matter of business with him, he begged him to sit down on the sofa and sat down himself on the other end, waiting for him to explain his business, with that careful and over-serious attention which is at once oppressive and embarrassing, especially to a stranger, and especially if what you are discussing is in your opinion of far too little importance for such exceptional solemnity.
0x3652f122c2d5ac8d7ff4e7b19d11a22a3d49ad8a but in brief and coherent phrases raskolnikov explained his business clearly and exactly, and was so well satisfied with himself that he even succeeded in taking a good look at porfiry.
0xd298df579367fb03d2474c80f8bb13edac379a95 porfiry petrovitch did not once take his eyes off him.
0x548c447ba1c7e093e97169637f941bbb66291cae razumihin, sitting opposite at the same table, listened warmly and impatiently, looking from one to the other every moment with rather excessive interest.
0xcf2cbf2c046c24783d49685d94725cbb33d6802c “fool,” raskolnikov swore to himself.
0xe329766de9a24778fb285f2eaa696375a2f7b322 “you have to give information to the police,” porfiry replied, with a most businesslike air, “that having learnt of this incident, that is of the murder, you beg to inform the lawyer in charge of the case that such and such things belong to you, and that you desire to redeem them... or... but they will write to you.”
0xb77ac985b0830bbbcb6412845e0c96567614b7c6 “that’s just the point, that at the present moment,” raskolnikov tried his utmost to feign embarrassment, “i am not quite in funds... and even this trifling sum is beyond me... i only wanted, you see, for the present to declare that the things are mine, and that when i have money....” “that’s no matter,” answered porfiry petrovitch, receiving his explanation of his pecuniary position coldly, “but you can, if you prefer, write straight to me, to say, that having been informed of the matter, and claiming such and such as your property, you beg...” “on an ordinary sheet of paper?”
0x811955d03d78d7bb276c4b997b0be0fef4783e9e raskolnikov interrupted eagerly, again interested in the financial side of the question.
0x725540bcf97d2c09208b8908bf8cc14df2880c0c “oh, the most ordinary,” and suddenly porfiry petrovitch looked with obvious irony at him, screwing up his eyes and, as it were, winking at him.
0x4a6095ff5acccb592ff703a86206c859d26e21d2 but perhaps it was raskolnikov’s fancy, for it all lasted but a moment.
0x74f1e081e2af95816b1ebd9b9517d4e49cbb0d2d there was certainly something of the sort, raskolnikov could have sworn he winked at him, goodness knows why.
0x899b476439e2c7cfb237a933f33e6ca368759caf “he knows,” flashed through his mind like lightning.
0x3e1801b9909e12defae586cf6b82244ddb74ff5b “forgive my troubling you about such trifles,” he went on, a little disconcerted, “the things are only worth five roubles, but i prize them particularly for the sake of those from whom they came to me, and i must confess that i was alarmed when i heard...” “that’s why you were so much struck when i mentioned to zossimov that porfiry was inquiring for everyone who had pledges!”
0x60e2d0a2b313824e14639fb1d8a19ba6ed0d8beb razumihin put in with obvious intention.
0x099d08f39b8e579977d51263dc475e4b1fdc19f1 this was really unbearable.
0x01f5fa095e2f21564846716513dbefa1100c2a4e raskolnikov could not help glancing at him with a flash of vindictive anger in his black eyes, but immediately recollected himself.
0x6b0f0df7b9f5a4036a92feb8934dcce2fc1cf286 “you seem to be jeering at me, brother?”
0x9a5322039fc364eafe9b99495c44699284ea7d8d he said to him, with a well-feigned irritability.
0xfc5a811879da8316c0a08f532d72e3d4b2075083 “i dare say i do seem to you absurdly anxious about such trash; but you mustn’t think me selfish or grasping for that, and these two things may be anything but trash in my eyes.
0xd521fafc66cb36cb7382406d75799906f8a88e0f i told you just now that the silver watch, though it’s not worth a cent, is the only thing left us of my father’s.
0x16bcde1483ea01a706081a242fee7028f2beb59b you may laugh at me, but my mother is here,” he turned suddenly to porfiry, “and if she knew,” he turned again hurriedly to razumihin, carefully making his voice tremble, “that the watch was lost, she would be in despair!
0xd02a776f722755b421b7a2fcf8c54643f16fda7b you know what women are!”
0x471f46f318130d00dd681256c0fa2de40d99239a “not a bit of it!
0x6785315c65326c069144bd5bbb75fbb2a9e55529 i didn’t mean that at all!
0x025ca58396148518607d684fbea104fb294859d3 quite the contrary!”
0x3bc9838c63cf6e39cd6dae332331d4b741f2e054 shouted razumihin distressed.
0x92289908c50c9d5ab49248823da7d12f1a926f35 “was it right?
0x08ff174430d277cbc3d59f0899b1b4f4e1584893 was it natural?
0x8b11c24f0955353a1b845d1ebae288b0f1d5a99c did i overdo it?”
0xa6fffc2ece79d8a0c8e43ab969a99faeccd1143a raskolnikov asked himself in a tremor.
0x8715c814909712cdf518934626490248ea7066e6 “why did i say that about women?”
0x34c4a402f20824787a9f9efc5591028d7e912c76 “oh, your mother is with you?”
0x296eb0d5ced4be6d91d23fd5df9f1ecc70521062 porfiry petrovitch inquired.
0xa00f66ccca0a0d5e24a747fa3544a07776ae36a4 “yes.”
0xaf22c784bbef5805a967863643f93e79a9c12fcb “when did she come?”
0x735f4e8668bc9564dbed5e3b4d9da8c92cf94d7f “last night.”
0x5700deba087120b7d83b5140c54a750437742ccd porfiry paused as though reflecting.
0x9260ebf06aad6226deab9b0975fd95b48a77298f “your things would not in any case be lost,” he went on calmly and coldly.
0x48b30bd6b769065923c4ae729bcbc032d664e836 “i have been expecting you here for some time.”
0x0bdc28744d6abe7fdd591ca0a11aaa3b8c61510c and as though that was a matter of no importance, he carefully offered the ash-tray to razumihin, who was ruthlessly scattering cigarette ash over the carpet.
0x2ccb9df2d6698ba7953d12799109835519d79726 raskolnikov shuddered, but porfiry did not seem to be looking at him, and was still concerned with razumihin’s cigarette.
0xd925ce5fccd34b0b9314565227fa1f35fbe7007c “what?
0x4e081c4e1b13f1b81267e154775582a4cf9507e6 expecting him?
0x1c5390f8063d301d60b9dccf30348f5a6e3be81b why, did you know that he had pledges _there_?”
0x7c4d547aee74a44436715f8c7bf5ee0ca8053140 cried razumihin.
0xd96aed63ee51455db3e74f3787074f35c1eed7b1 porfiry petrovitch addressed himself to raskolnikov.
0x9f4ae662048dccb7893f33736f88204663f2015c “your things, the ring and the watch, were wrapped up together, and on the paper your name was legibly written in pencil, together with the date on which you left them with her...” “how observant you are!”
0x4ed1e183bf66e0a62f0920ecfc86b925077ab46f raskolnikov smiled awkwardly, doing his very utmost to look him straight in the face, but he failed, and suddenly added: “i say that because i suppose there were a great many pledges... that it must be difficult to remember them all.... but you remember them all so clearly, and... and...” “stupid!
0x0384e4307b1e231a92855ae68b7bde421bb4e537 feeble!”
0xf5eb9a7700c47f1c638e42f6143a3df6b0941693 he thought.
0x77a589e7522b10a6eb8904f04a36e6c43374c82b “why did i add that?”
0x238e3eeab2f2f03cbec5d17a93e0f1b7f1c34c6c “but we know all who had pledges, and you are the only one who hasn’t come forward,” porfiry answered with hardly perceptible irony.
0x7f2c838f394785ef3eb848ffafec584f608ec457 “i haven’t been quite well.”
0x507b9c0dc7c0f5b37daba5938ab9d73a15d4ca9c “i heard that too.
0x082f2ec15a65087979934950075289d59a30d70f i heard, indeed, that you were in great distress about something.
0x6d15d177f52bbdb75c902f8c0b22acdb7d2e9f2b you look pale still.”
0x6c134d536b6066e8ae91b89899bdcfba12b95738 “i am not pale at all.... no, i am quite well,” raskolnikov snapped out rudely and angrily, completely changing his tone.
0xdde881c6ebbb47651228b80782c84a9efd1c66e6 his anger was mounting, he could not repress it.
0x55753d7155a00e7be2b3a3d777bc54baac0b5899 “and in my anger i shall betray myself,” flashed through his mind again.
0xa8fb8cfe98bf69d2269417169f31d150971fb710 “why are they torturing me?”
0x68aa5ff25cb405ec66b416bf944b47c4e1934523 “not quite well!”
0xf2819ef49f1998f4b9ff4de4760fc38554c5aff6 razumihin caught him up.
0x3303573d281d6ddcc77c9e24f4bc8e953be00a49 “what next!
0x77143b097a376c1b43ed6d6a394d1724d0808a75 he was unconscious and delirious all yesterday.
0x16d39afe587851e3fc2c9bb77f83c21922bea1f6 would you believe, porfiry, as soon as our backs were turned, he dressed, though he could hardly stand, and gave us the slip and went off on a spree somewhere till midnight, delirious all the time!
0x5fa62f43617f47ceba5a8174239c57f814fb013f would you believe it!
0xaedd4678fc7ad889ad12a4131343492ee629d821 extraordinary!”
0x5e83ceec942af6473a60f5d7487170e354e30413 “really delirious?
0x1d0d2366e7034cbdf5ee11fd3e5fa22b43232222 you don’t say so!”
0xbe13a5fc0d33fcd5fb49367138dd5b198f9856a7 porfiry shook his head in a womanish way.
0xbe1e96968635af07c9f3a2224580c7e37866e8f4 “nonsense!
0xaa218e536940657a2d8998c9daa83f47edc8427f don’t you believe it!
0xe9b42ab420b6298de10d56f71fe12d70a56583fd but you don’t believe it anyway,” raskolnikov let slip in his anger.
0x25fc229057f9b18c44199e59d95c329c2848fc5d but porfiry petrovitch did not seem to catch those strange words.
0x01a61dcded4fa77aa34a8c955d92bac9e6926997 “but how could you have gone out if you hadn’t been delirious?”
0xd170ac728524fdbd3855ea849c6884cd0e7b663e razumihin got hot suddenly.
0x54029e6dfd12b8221dbf676d9177d532e163d781 “what did you go out for?
0x197eb20822dd16be5cd908a1a56e58997c8cef79 what was the object of it?
0xf4feef26324c9ac37b84f40bb4cf4c9347a70df1 and why on the sly?
0xe7128e85275b23efc3b35d867048c9a1a12125cb were you in your senses when you did it?
0xf8e245d65381a6556daee4b8dc7dc61bf4b4db2f now that all danger is over i can speak plainly.”
0x92daf1d85545e47a3b85beeebf5d05dc441f061f “i was awfully sick of them yesterday.”
0x52c4d11b2468205a6d5a9f9ef4f53e69fc430a20 raskolnikov addressed porfiry suddenly with a smile of insolent defiance, “i ran away from them to take lodgings where they wouldn’t find me, and took a lot of money with me.
0x372773dcc0946a66f51efdaaa54c8e3be2447863 mr. zametov there saw it.
0x1d45e1ce64c47f416f4235a53d1dab9a83a23f57 i say, mr. zametov, was i sensible or delirious yesterday; settle our dispute.”
0x7c44cbd5726f7d777540e6e5fec0d4778c3bf972 he could have strangled zametov at that moment, so hateful were his expression and his silence to him.
0xe6aaa7ab6c12ea5fa0eed653e44d87be3b618e5b “in my opinion you talked sensibly and even artfully, but you were extremely irritable,” zametov pronounced dryly.
0x75b813354417950b63dad84a1cc106dfe2765573 “and nikodim fomitch was telling me to-day,” put in porfiry petrovitch, “that he met you very late last night in the lodging of a man who had been run over.”
0x65850c0eecb590dad77e3ce1eb31b0a096a3c4c0 “and there,” said razumihin, “weren’t you mad then?
0x9b479be5f3d233d900437b65484ca1c25cb9a19d you gave your last penny to the widow for the funeral.
0x703c04469030cedf47ba855609b668a31068b6d1 if you wanted to help, give fifteen or twenty even, but keep three roubles for yourself at least, but he flung away all the twenty-five at once!”
0x2bbd5e6e147fc24723aa80133181f8fb60c46745 “maybe i found a treasure somewhere and you know nothing of it?
0x8bacbac1659aebb8e37c1a682fa55605787ab514 so that’s why i was liberal yesterday.... mr. zametov knows i’ve found a treasure!
0x2e43f99eaf70580045d49fc8975ae211f3faaf4d excuse us, please, for disturbing you for half an hour with such trivialities,” he said, turning to porfiry petrovitch, with trembling lips.
0x376a5942ffea9241baa7ee3b33512d29d69ebaae “we are boring you, aren’t we?”
0x20fceee17c41679be7fef120f5c0273a2c28c9d8 “oh no, quite the contrary, quite the contrary!
0x39c3053b03b126735691dcaea583022e51e15a91 if only you knew how you interest me!
0x32a2a778f3c35b0a5b8227783e99a5ca4a421d61 it’s interesting to look on and listen... and i am really glad you have come forward at last.”
0x94a8886d654180d063c211a403b1eadd1d62559e “but you might give us some tea!
0x63b3d1a08e70b344fe61e5ecf88872f70701e38f my throat’s dry,” cried razumihin.
0xeff4cfccc32fe1635304b1e85948f731f313c37e “capital idea!
0xcff9f1b026a1ab9343582734e2ca78dd5131cb62 perhaps we will all keep you company.
0x9926323486b39bfa3f99fc0b857e0f0d846bf41d wouldn’t you like... something more essential before tea?”
0x1f1675bdf539b5d8bf21d4d27c13fc2473345941 “get along with you!”
0xe4ef048f85a0d71f397fdf54b90e9f7b1a26f07f porfiry petrovitch went out to order tea.
0x659bcc8ed5b76abe05f81f3b6a73422538b37155 raskolnikov’s thoughts were in a whirl.
0x23ae129edf8b97712265a559c4b9753ed2737d1f he was in terrible exasperation.
0x1798a120f4eb5d6241bfab9e64caaa9a2cafdc9c “the worst of it is they don’t disguise it; they don’t care to stand on ceremony!
0x2266ac346e067e882479f469025b42f13d697759 and how if you didn’t know me at all, did you come to talk to nikodim fomitch about me?

0x604a1552c08358c0d5ed315b9d18d63fe796b0ac they simply spit in my face.”
0x07a26879c37302f44665342aa49d6b2b002f4ad3 he was shaking with rage.
0xf000608572b5d996ed2be6415eef584a933996e6 “come, strike me openly, don’t play with me like a cat with a mouse.
0x23c0efc8316d3ec89c7f993e7e19cd4fdca54c6f it’s hardly civil, porfiry petrovitch, but perhaps i won’t allow it!
0xe9286a5042cdf56c0f81ce9549609b5c7aa017bc i shall get up and throw the whole truth in your ugly faces, and you’ll see how i despise you.”
0x45c438c70ab5abd1b8cbc715bc72d40bc423accc he could hardly breathe.
0x7cd8774b48ce47dc82b00ab9a642352fba138983 “and what if it’s only my fancy?
0x85247451bbefca2a492f22996877f63bb593dfd5 what if i am mistaken, and through inexperience i get angry and don’t keep up my nasty part?
0xd4800a4190d7036318556b7b0845271f6eaf988d perhaps it’s all unintentional.
0x82465442712bfe8b6ba844ea8e983946f9b217b3 all their phrases are the usual ones, but there is something about them.... it all might be said, but there is something.
0x8cf842bf1151c194bd90c747a21920b4ae1b3f34 why did he say bluntly, ‘with her’?
0xdf88917a893c62c709eab95877c34e03a11197bb why did zametov add that i spoke artfully?
0x7b330eb776a6d25882b12044c1e1c06a2a5ca055 why do they speak in that tone?
0x55dd4a5a84e29fc540af39b87e71023cc58a20a5 yes, the tone.... razumihin is sitting here, why does he see nothing?
0xfb50287b6f4936830bc97c71c7f49c9c9367d3cc that innocent blockhead never does see anything!
0x659609838d36f955a9057fe6f9593d82706c0d8d feverish again!
0xfffea1357233bcfab402c6b60160e2a93e0bd3cc did porfiry wink at me just now?
0xc3b3b425554a4e0befe4eda2082559d6d859ea09 of course it’s nonsense!
0xc64534b971bb77d1899d7b0b3c09622edc6dac8c what could he wink for?
0x63a03f93a47a34cc47f32e72db6c3a48699cb7b3 are they trying to upset my nerves or are they teasing me?
0x66859ba485d8b9a5432acfb000725f29d1725b37 either it’s ill fancy or they know!
0x1539d576730da3bd6ec76e4d98182abb1a8627be even zametov is rude.... is zametov rude?
0xca1d4c44ada7e7143ead822e59d355f1e062914c zametov has changed his mind.
0xee042726a4fe0551b4ae0ad2df3e0c517d059995 i foresaw he would change his mind!
0x4f09bcff54ea3dc3f25448e363f682ff270c44e1 he is at home here, while it’s my first visit.
0x59d08dae5cd68fa4b52a7f3360bb4a0938837c07 porfiry does not consider him a visitor; sits with his back to him.
0x4b4282cfdc3a03a06c67e62cf2ce4e9f4985e5cd they’re as thick as thieves, no doubt, over me!
0x5d4934b3db768eaea4dc83e70951bb2391fc1d77 not a doubt they were talking about me before we came.
0xa872bb6b6e2a20bae40fe101982d40bd66c22c71 do they know about the flat?
0x3ea0be7ea03dbbc596a7607e67d09423beca8dc1 if only they’d make haste!
0xdc1ebca9899c7557f2203e8d49e594eea59b7027 when i said that i ran away to take a flat he let it pass.... i put that in cleverly about a flat, it may be of use afterwards.... delirious, indeed... ha-ha-ha!
0x59fff156424d4724067c13382ec940d7240b023a he knows all about last night!
0xa380c9f8963bc80d8c8ca49cf605fe835be4b08b he didn’t know of my mother’s arrival!
0x2a8e9055d8ebc68fe77ead7071b56e4ae3c37fc3 the hag had written the date on in pencil!
0x36a99fdcc8574ed8009b102579fe07cfdc553e03 you are wrong, you won’t catch me!
0xce2e1f907204b948ff03c29879a028c99b2ed5df there are no facts... it’s all supposition!
0x815bcf7b8cba1e0ef940ef48ab24338c698bba36 you produce facts!
0xe87f6322ca0399bfbf21b87f0a9fe4b4d928c1c0 the flat even isn’t a fact but delirium.
0xa1263b0ff1d1b8eadacdc7b3d30ed781349728f4 i know what to say to them.... do they know about the flat?
0xb16200e58ae52284a89774e2d09daa042cd32c64 i won’t go without finding out.
0xee867e8249dbc352606d5cd39696829cc6bfb6e9 what did i come for?
0x4ad1466e6687a994ea9d68d189695d0aa2dd0862 but my being angry now, maybe is a fact!
0xcffcb8ae53bc7dfcd51336abb7430be85e88ca9e fool, how irritable i am!
0xf7219963eae5c146e878cc7486eba4741446610c perhaps that’s right; to play the invalid.... he is feeling me.
0xc1aea5cacc757eac427eacdf27a3f00b8e063f19 he will try to catch me.
0x15fd61dccce7c948891fd78a0281b30bf9fbfd51 why did i come?”
0xc23012cff123e0ad1116a991dc95d8ade79764cb all this flashed like lightning through his mind.
0x131910b7d6b279b6b1af60090e643d61f690085c porfiry petrovitch returned quickly.
0x21fc0e9fae4aebccda16ed6d412db0af0965187e he became suddenly more jovial.
0xe81d36fa5ed28c1c55edf2e4420ee8836672974e “your party yesterday, brother, has left my head rather.... and i am out of sorts altogether,” he began in quite a different tone, laughing to razumihin.
0x2d6dfedcca5343e2ce5e7857755b6715f43e5702 “was it interesting?
0x9bb5ac3d841bc3f6b291534958ef69c1d93c560b i left you yesterday at the most interesting point.
0x99fb7d2463158ad7a00055dbb6b7806271a2f282 who got the best of it?”
0x3efa31a36b3f64f5213343f14bcc4fa9e55bc64b “oh, no one, of course.
0x0940b0613e28a29f45ece7b7297c25203282658d they got on to everlasting questions, floated off into space.”
0x0e8af20a882c0f26e61ed95c78efb8f59a356f61 “only fancy, rodya, what we got on to yesterday.
0xcd02dcb9132ff1af5fe5ae4a07c35c2a28f917cf whether there is such a thing as crime.
0x9d2347535bdc7df8cc13fac9737b159b9957d641 i told you that we talked our heads off.”
0xf81310c27c5cfcc818ce5d3fecb013970550df41 “what is there strange?
0x34ba1175757c019993c4b9491a34205f49637283 it’s an everyday social question,” raskolnikov answered casually.
0xb0984f8ad8f39619f0aec36ddc00594122002f88 “the question wasn’t put quite like that,” observed porfiry.
0xf65b40c6f929cb8009e63be438a64c29f352fce1 “not quite, that’s true,” razumihin agreed at once, getting warm and hurried as usual.
0x0886d33ef74760e212ff3bcb58ebe5652b79e1aa “listen, rodion, and tell us your opinion, i want to hear it.
0x60c2bf90acce71ce393e54edfbc4868b66e2b153 i was fighting tooth and nail with them and wanted you to help me.
0x7a5001ac6f4aaa8704a195655b659de926f41d19 i told them you were coming.... it began with the socialist doctrine.
0x6d7ee8c88137ff76155bdcf1e19a871a4381f723 you know their doctrine; crime is a protest against the abnormality of the social organisation and nothing more, and nothing more; no other causes admitted!...”
0x3573f8593f104a1e90ffa8d87fa8aea18acec5c9 “you are wrong there,” cried porfiry petrovitch; he was noticeably animated and kept laughing as he looked at razumihin, which made him more excited than ever.
0xdcfcefe3343b51bab186d43a845e4285529a061b “nothing is admitted,” razumihin interrupted with heat.
0x0804503a08b74a88c35e2ef7fa578e7282f1fbc3 “i am not wrong.
0x19bec9982898d940cd1daad1fdf5a9ba2fce7b5e i’ll show you their pamphlets.
0xa45fb5537ee61ab3b5256f90f333bdc2c3d1e40b everything with them is ‘the influence of environment,’ and nothing else.
0x44185ba5c5185de79c7f9934fcaae99d63b93df2 their favourite phrase!
0x660fd4ea5d8b47349156e4f9b84a68b620a24817 from which it follows that, if society is normally organised, all crime will cease at once, since there will be nothing to protest against and all men will become righteous in one instant.
0xf45bf7bde818769921a28dbd3e6af80874190919 human nature is not taken into account, it is excluded, it’s not supposed to exist!
0x93d7819d244e299ce84ecdcab4d006469a743c45 they don’t recognise that humanity, developing by a historical living process, will become at last a normal society, but they believe that a social system that has come out of some mathematical brain is going to organise all humanity at once and make it just and sinless in an instant, quicker than any living process!
0x4bc5c096e06ee945cfe1849b8501e941c71aa2e2 that’s why they instinctively dislike history, ‘nothing but ugliness and stupidity in it,’ and they explain it all as stupidity!
0x1e3a8d494eb277505d0e155a30e0eca758a6354f that’s why they so dislike the _living_ process of life; they don’t want a _living soul_!
0xa4625c7cfbb1a40264fa2bc1614bae58e3cb3ca0 the living soul demands life, the soul won’t obey the rules of mechanics, the soul is an object of suspicion, the soul is retrograde!
0xdbaada8fc57ce35a556348bdd7abf0dde35b0da0 but what they want though it smells of death and can be made of india-rubber, at least is not alive, has no will, is servile and won’t revolt!
0xf73d3cff4547ac82ac70ba4373e5e37ad37d0e27 and it comes in the end to their reducing everything to the building of walls and the planning of rooms and passages in a phalanstery!
0x181676febe17cac542e642f0a367f7a1f75ba5ce the phalanstery is ready, indeed, but your human nature is not ready for the phalanstery--it wants life, it hasn’t completed its vital process, it’s too soon for the graveyard!
0x7aa33e531748b7af8439f88e900de1812ae01fd3 you can’t skip over nature by logic.
0x19c19f1ad575822d701a7b2ea42f619a99d58e70 logic presupposes three possibilities, but there are millions!
0x9d5a5d799e906dffaa5f5c26f3e676adddda68d7 cut away a million, and reduce it all to the question of comfort!
0xc200bb40d1b8e212d3be754632b096159f9d9117 that’s the easiest solution of the problem!
0x7fbfef899a17bd948545b6df012be9a5ded78d07 it’s seductively clear and you musn’t think about it.
0x5e0ccf94dce0785aa6cdd081f746ec44154d2196 that’s the great thing, you mustn’t think!
0x57809a1c1a50ff805e5b4bd234c112db5cf9a63f the whole secret of life in two pages of print!”
0x8bf7e5864a36cc4e0251babec8d5d96f6cedfa94 “now he is off, beating the drum!
0xea6b11babe1a5f6ddb4df2584c075388044febda catch hold of him, do!”
0xb872169c103c63ba2b6087ec2d5930ae7f6b33d2 laughed porfiry.
0x43c4259ce739db27e8c1399cd1e30b8468722ae6 “can you imagine,” he turned to raskolnikov, “six people holding forth like that last night, in one room, with punch as a preliminary!
0x7309efb802048ee019d33f561f2c90aa477edeec no, brother, you are wrong, environment accounts for a great deal in crime; i can assure you of that.”
0x496e2f50b7c894e8190bf2e08d673eb96cd69ef8 “oh, i know it does, but just tell me: a man of forty violates a child of ten; was it environment drove him to it?”
0xf59e3a38df4f01b10c139178cc6bca2eef46ca11 “well, strictly speaking, it did,” porfiry observed with noteworthy gravity; “a crime of that nature may be very well ascribed to the influence of environment.”
0x9d6e1154edfa7a8a0a58b36bfaeb9b603c003de9 razumihin was almost in a frenzy.
0xe348ae4c0e2435fbd617bfb08a0f20f92f5fdedf “oh, if you like,” he roared.
0x6442f84be6ac3e5ef39403d244c2e83daf32f46f “i’ll prove to you that your white eyelashes may very well be ascribed to the church of ivan the great’s being two hundred and fifty feet high, and i will prove it clearly, exactly, progressively, and even with a liberal tendency!
0xaf7c45af18ac8b785eeb24ebd1e8eb48467319b5 i undertake to!
0x8327872e218464d81765a796197dc408483e6443 will you bet on it?”
0x3363da55f57f3834352ea9b1ba8c78b57f8bf964 “done!
0xb1a62343a0b8397da2bb7726ec7816d16bb6d689 let’s hear, please, how he will prove it!”
0x1c27390e4dfe436f750e1a74905f76fad235b507 “he is always humbugging, confound him,” cried razumihin, jumping up and gesticulating.
0xe55ffabebbd9dd58fd4db61125f479467697c0e9 “what’s the use of talking to you?
0x2bd56d8e5c0c171462b5c68da09995a10cf44849 he does all that on purpose; you don’t know him, rodion!
0xb8279619a161b08403443022033ce42d7e3fc62d he took their side yesterday, simply to make fools of them.
0xfa5c5a883402b3166a5acc5da15a889b4cbe406a and the things he said yesterday!
0x276e92e61b623bb0da7761feb56e5d0e1f16f40d and they were delighted!
0x27b286670a82f2412b0993a186830256d26e4977 he can keep it up for a fortnight together.
0x1cb15ec8c8dd12422f58d457b09b882fad7481a9 last year he persuaded us that he was going into a monastery: he stuck to it for two months.
0xe202ee2f25e48bc72b189831559b375abfb1875d not long ago he took it into his head to declare he was going to get married, that he had everything ready for the wedding.
0xaefbc826807d56f2476c6d44cd85871bc1bc9646 he ordered new clothes indeed.
0x6e748010adfeb96a72cc4d2fc523d1f098a261b4 we all began to congratulate him.
0x095bbfa1601f907b0d0d4dd23f1a15a1d796d2d7 there was no bride, nothing, all pure fantasy!”
0x042262922b0ae3cbf476469ce9736ab85195a880 “ah, you are wrong!
0x66e7d8e125356130ea1d32efa5412a1804318e82 i got the clothes before.
0x2f63b26a79474f807484c9d5fd31d805c684df86 it was the new clothes in fact that made me think of taking you in.”
0xe6abfce9c8d21a4805610c9a5e7ad7b4a6db1c86 “are you such a good dissembler?”
0xd2a292347d180265c0003c1a03015a6f56d4f436 raskolnikov asked carelessly.

0xb80798e550704b064786555fc3aa6600ded66853 raskolnikov asked in astonishment.
0x87224593c7293a1b11608fe7f19baa4082d0a60c “i certainly did write an article upon a book six months ago when i left the university, but i sent it to the _weekly review_.”

0x8e74bef4b728c6517e40d972d51a326c8f315991 “i analysed, if i remember, the psychology of a criminal before and after the crime.”
0x3088be6db94dea091654f4e48e48224b555f9a3d “yes, and you maintained that the perpetration of a crime is always accompanied by illness.
0x9aabd52ad42e08c7bd1d4b41c078ba2a46334a63 very, very original, but... it was not that part of your article that interested me so much, but an idea at the end of the article which i regret to say you merely suggested without working it out clearly.
0xa395f5008f9441ff39d45abefadcf91ad2b6ae38 there is, if you recollect, a suggestion that there are certain persons who can... that is, not precisely are able to, but have a perfect right to commit breaches of morality and crimes, and that the law is not for them.”
0xd48ab29acb1f4403789a671f15171cd63df1ece5 raskolnikov smiled at the exaggerated and intentional distortion of his idea.
0xd925ce5fccd34b0b9314565227fa1f35fbe7007c “what?
0x7cf5cb90f64d4c513b3fa482057f80ab3bbc685f what do you mean?
0x66c788cca4cac54350d3f6741343ae92e417aaa5 a right to crime?
0x0be7af6eeb797878e9f030bbf4305fd70fd5eaf5 but not because of the influence of environment?”
0x4891b6a5925a0581ba0a591dcf6c9771926b2eae razumihin inquired with some alarm even.
0x2cf9954decca1eeb292257c0353c5aa5f13881ee “no, not exactly because of it,” answered porfiry.
0x867457c643550df85bf5839fec660e1681210c2e “in his article all men are divided into ‘ordinary’ and ‘extraordinary.’
0x9667ac7545cd2352bb50baa72522d198063b5ee7 ordinary men have to live in submission, have no right to transgress the law, because, don’t you see, they are ordinary.
0xc0ac721daeede0f139d428d490bbae613424faa8 but extraordinary men have a right to commit any crime and to transgress the law in any way, just because they are extraordinary.
0x977f6644b0e79ee83d039e7ebf0901e4cbc6dca6 that was your idea, if i am not mistaken?”
0x9dd1008505177c60e598e9d07c1b2026ab81333c “what do you mean?
0x936c83fa6faf8d9e8f54823a05ba45887913ce95 that can’t be right?”
0x4be3b1f501dd87ea57279ddf5538e9af249da2cc razumihin muttered in bewilderment.
0x1ec88946bf320016931936ed1b0e5435e280dd30 raskolnikov smiled again.
0x77623c098eb26c26be39ff8cd048ab1bd8c83dd3 he saw the point at once, and knew where they wanted to drive him.
0x86deac6733e0e9a8b49995e89d7f8fee7b0b5abe he decided to take up the challenge.
0x1f8837ee019d43387c63255f184f934ed3d86ade “that wasn’t quite my contention,” he began simply and modestly.
0x52158ea2a699a2cd85159bc58b5ff1a69c91f4e9 “yet i admit that you have stated it almost correctly; perhaps, if you like, perfectly so.”
0x48379eb6a3f3e3985621ed800acb944a46f2b628 (it almost gave him pleasure to admit this.)
0x378a96c49262d37c95f97cf43a1e080939d202f0 “the only difference is that i don’t contend that extraordinary people are always bound to commit breaches of morals, as you call it.
0xc3dacf36ef12e2b9ff38b3eb809f418aba7a5c4a in fact, i doubt whether such an argument could be published.
0x7b6e00d90a52d57bd3daaae4a14b95352731ba2e i simply hinted that an ‘extraordinary’ man has the right... that is not an official right, but an inner right to decide in his own conscience to overstep... certain obstacles, and only in case it is essential for the practical fulfilment of his idea (sometimes, perhaps, of benefit to the whole of humanity).
0xa8b932e2ecf330729a09bf868870e9cba7b0d9d2 you say that my article isn’t definite; i am ready to make it as clear as i can.
0xd86decf94f5b18c23b748e0613070929173042f0 perhaps i am right in thinking you want me to; very well.
0xa079d1a006d6101ca96d622aed82fd158536ae34 i maintain that if the discoveries of kepler and newton could not have been made known except by sacrificing the lives of one, a dozen, a hundred, or more men, newton would have had the right, would indeed have been in duty-bound... to _eliminate_ the dozen or the hundred men for the sake of making his discoveries known to the whole of humanity.
0xb30a34e57638143587352fb1814264023a289cf2 but it does not follow from that that newton had a right to murder people right and left and to steal every day in the market.
0x75966805933834287949242e62aa67a8726292e3 then, i remember, i maintain in my article that all... well, legislators and leaders of men, such as lycurgus, solon, mahomet, napoleon, and so on, were all without exception criminals, from the very fact that, making a new law, they transgressed the ancient one, handed down from their ancestors and held sacred by the people, and they did not stop short at bloodshed either, if that bloodshed--often of innocent persons fighting bravely in defence of ancient law--were of use to their cause.
0xf3fb6172687e6dc003c642f1cfcc3cfdd34c20a1 it’s remarkable, in fact, that the majority, indeed, of these benefactors and leaders of humanity were guilty of terrible carnage.
0x3c95a34a60e3e4f75ba16a02db1aa50d7985109c in short, i maintain that all great men or even men a little out of the common, that is to say capable of giving some new word, must from their very nature be criminals--more or less, of course.
0x8ba8687a2a521d683b6f58bce56f8b3f427484d7 otherwise it’s hard for them to get out of the common rut; and to remain in the common rut is what they can’t submit to, from their very nature again, and to my mind they ought not, indeed, to submit to it.
0x9c039e6b47d2181dcaba9a661a244c4b8be71857 you see that there is nothing particularly new in all that.
0x8de0d02335af291531e7597c2c960df7bb585a49 the same thing has been printed and read a thousand times before.
0x0c4dea1da88af4c0348392c1eec3d8342f87f2e2 as for my division of people into ordinary and extraordinary, i acknowledge that it’s somewhat arbitrary, but i don’t insist upon exact numbers.
0xbaf4b21af88f67afc86e9680ffa7a40f44e61bae i only believe in my leading idea that men are _in general_ divided by a law of nature into two categories, inferior (ordinary), that is, so to say, material that serves only to reproduce its kind, and men who have the gift or the talent to utter _a new word_.
0xe1886a81fc9e9c6ff492e0a71a963898d9ecf40b there are, of course, innumerable sub-divisions, but the distinguishing features of both categories are fairly well marked.
0xb1e4230aabd72dd5a2a12dbafbc63598f56ff6ff the first category, generally speaking, are men conservative in temperament and law-abiding; they live under control and love to be controlled.
0x8edd7dfae31f77e609c56cebc9b5f2fc054eb0ef to my thinking it is their duty to be controlled, because that’s their vocation, and there is nothing humiliating in it for them.
0x14c8b9dee17c6e3f053addc5c0d5fc7ae325a689 the second category all transgress the law; they are destroyers or disposed to destruction according to their capacities.
0xfac87c20b2e87778feefeae5816aa154db0a7bb8 the crimes of these men are of course relative and varied; for the most part they seek in very varied ways the destruction of the present for the sake of the better.
0xa012e74fe80d41a9f682cc17b6b32b138d33458d but if such a one is forced for the sake of his idea to step over a corpse or wade through blood, he can, i maintain, find within himself, in his conscience, a sanction for wading through blood--that depends on the idea and its dimensions, note that.
0x19cf6701b9857a7b7b3c90f618c1c95a379184cb it’s only in that sense i speak of their right to crime in my article (you remember it began with the legal question).
0xfb530a64ce948d53b4c3ed2c45c330f310a3b344 there’s no need for such anxiety, however; the masses will scarcely ever admit this right, they punish them or hang them (more or less), and in doing so fulfil quite justly their conservative vocation.
0x7ba31b9a9c4b49155087be930763055be5b96b2e but the same masses set these criminals on a pedestal in the next generation and worship them (more or less).
0xa5c1b84650d5ec770560400ec4e4d96da20a5826 the first category is always the man of the present, the second the man of the future.
0x718db3e7ea255018d158ffd417211ddeea7b3185 the first preserve the world and people it, the second move the world and lead it to its goal.
0x57069204b3d532f48909b7b54a25edb944548d71 each class has an equal right to exist.
0x369f605fdfc351f162b57dc2e379ff78538f506e in fact, all have equal rights with me--and _vive la guerre éternelle_--till the new jerusalem, of course!”
0x6aad300e522e26f5545132e8af4c1109ea3253cb “then you believe in the new jerusalem, do you?”
0x0c4b47f84648339973a19287acb8fe6c6d9ece18 “i do,” raskolnikov answered firmly; as he said these words and during the whole preceding tirade he kept his eyes on one spot on the carpet.
0x901d2d0e28b829d771b193481690755beacc3aeb “and... and do you believe in god?
0x486c30ea0c622c3a47c57936fab2da46ad814868 excuse my curiosity.”
0x56fff63daf184e15005f7da38c36caa5cfdf9210 “i do,” repeated raskolnikov, raising his eyes to porfiry.
0x2ee4e61076c59f6f9a5bffb6b71e564abf46b8fa “and... do you believe in lazarus’ rising from the dead?”
0x974da238ed683a0eca807ca2dbe0635f0c3f34a6 “i... i do.
0x6a390a9606104ff9df1033dee2f1cd2931c5a8f2 why do you ask all this?”
0xd810d0371f8707df7de5b43c6e40d879a5a28272 “you believe it literally?”
0xe70aaaa8568a50af8c43d1e24a1cac1ff0a7c78d “literally.”
0xf6c10035a12f3af0b538bf39a80646acddce031a “you don’t say so.... i asked from curiosity.
0x91c6a04c0df1f35a0edd7a7f3ea3530a5a21f675 excuse me.
0x84b633587dcad3907db3121fae855bb3ae82fe6b but let us go back to the question; they are not always executed.
0x05472fd56f6c91c9b53206359de7da7f8b9b9f3d some, on the contrary...” “triumph in their lifetime?
0x7b10e17c7b9d3a316bc816e500d7119168753680 oh, yes, some attain their ends in this life, and then...” “they begin executing other people?”
0x63ada0c1c12fba4f940976b4f539f182d43a0f99 “if it’s necessary; indeed, for the most part they do.
0x9dfaf7562651f66435892d0a1a6a1c152e42cbe1 your remark is very witty.”
0x32265bcc8e85751cc4694308e6a450846f6bb0e2 “thank you.
0x90317060627b00c2870c86ce7def49d7597b3ecf but tell me this: how do you distinguish those extraordinary people from the ordinary ones?
0x91fe10114d35dfb243eccdea6e2d957545ed5eed are there signs at their birth?
0xe95776d36b6677443d3e4b79165be8620268c778 i feel there ought to be more exactitude, more external definition.
0x1b11dbf153ac9e8d9b279afb2c7e7bde4d3fb904 excuse the natural anxiety of a practical law-abiding citizen, but couldn’t they adopt a special uniform, for instance, couldn’t they wear something, be branded in some way?
0x4c82e00195153ce88461bf057a7ad9ca57177cd6 for you know if confusion arises and a member of one category imagines that he belongs to the other, begins to ‘eliminate obstacles’ as you so happily expressed it, then...” “oh, that very often happens!
0x3132677a5cd53bff88c207fd28bccd270007a46f that remark is wittier than the other.”
0x1a7ee421b33771b65a3aa0380034b97343c8ad06 “thank you.”
0xdcfe0bb15290263de3e740a46803deb802f27e96 “no reason to; but take note that the mistake can only arise in the first category, that is among the ordinary people (as i perhaps unfortunately called them).
0x80a3ac14fda273b0a887b6575da249b1a72b3851 in spite of their predisposition to obedience very many of them, through a playfulness of nature, sometimes vouchsafed even to the cow, like to imagine themselves advanced people, ‘destroyers,’ and to push themselves into the ‘new movement,’ and this quite sincerely.
0xf8fcce0767fde5d6af9858287e5adf95cbea0f22 meanwhile the really _new_ people are very often unobserved by them, or even despised as reactionaries of grovelling tendencies.
0xc54bd7ef226cc8bf72fd7f634cb6c42740856167 but i don’t think there is any considerable danger here, and you really need not be uneasy for they never go very far.
0xfa57c68e87fa48fd74f2cc0a7dede55a398a75ad of course, they might have a thrashing sometimes for letting their fancy run away with them and to teach them their place, but no more; in fact, even this isn’t necessary as they castigate themselves, for they are very conscientious: some perform this service for one another and others chastise themselves with their own hands.... they will impose various public acts of penitence upon themselves with a beautiful and edifying effect; in fact you’ve nothing to be uneasy about.... it’s a law of nature.”
0x8d3e539d77c49260df78c9af601f5767bde6786f “well, you have certainly set my mind more at rest on that score; but there’s another thing worries me.
0x28415b4f16ae559f8a27bba17bdd461894c74f79 tell me, please, are there many people who have the right to kill others, these extraordinary people?
0xc40854208ef6e0ac4b5fb75d055677a261c09a27 i am ready to bow down to them, of course, but you must admit it’s alarming if there are a great many of them, eh?”
0x30238472bb6efb65faf2897adf9fb7b2fe689b3b “oh, you needn’t worry about that either,” raskolnikov went on in the same tone.
0x0d57cb2e1bf39754884b3c568a49063a0d7d1c74 “people with new ideas, people with the faintest capacity for saying something _new_, are extremely few in number, extraordinarily so in fact.
0xa6d0a4ccb72062cd6e303c05e904f654a498fba5 one thing only is clear, that the appearance of all these grades and sub-divisions of men must follow with unfailing regularity some law of nature.
0xfae52a10e91783218ff8f4e4a9b3bb37b1e3b511 that law, of course, is unknown at present, but i am convinced that it exists, and one day may become known.
0x1d9546075b85a5ca37ff41764e7aa351c822986c the vast mass of mankind is mere material, and only exists in order by some great effort, by some mysterious process, by means of some crossing of races and stocks, to bring into the world at last perhaps one man out of a thousand with a spark of independence.
0x06a518bd8afc18d39bc968349f003cd9e542b30d one in ten thousand perhaps--i speak roughly, approximately--is born with some independence, and with still greater independence one in a hundred thousand.

0x87dc41f77488c63808d7513c5247fd79a15d2b49 in fact i have not peeped into the retort in which all this takes place.
0x4645f08cdbe8dbd2b9578fa603a5eaded9154183 but there certainly is and must be a definite law, it cannot be a matter of chance.”
0x1f08b25da86401dfcaff6fc19ddfccd773ccfbdd “why, are you both joking?”
0xb7d2d565ed52c7ae093e012b78e1d7230f563499 razumihin cried at last.
0x79427fbb6b585a2886e90242291440f9a52b3e24 “there you sit, making fun of one another.
0xd52290fca25b906b89c3a957dec87f8bfde26801 are you serious, rodya?”
0x273ed3ec16423f7e675dc179d9018e912c791e18 raskolnikov raised his pale and almost mournful face and made no reply.
0x79732d66ff2491e156529bb43531b55a1e81d185 and the unconcealed, persistent, nervous, and _discourteous_ sarcasm of porfiry seemed strange to razumihin beside that quiet and mournful face.
0xe541695a64f2cf4576e44a36d9c56d8136f6d536 “well, brother, if you are really serious... you are right, of course, in saying that it’s not new, that it’s like what we’ve read and heard a thousand times already; but what is really original in all this, and is exclusively your own, to my horror, is that you sanction bloodshed _in the name of conscience_, and, excuse my saying so, with such fanaticism.... that, i take it, is the point of your article.
0x2e3a3e91bf8f32a92b49d07746de3e3621b2228f but that sanction of bloodshed _by conscience_ is to my mind... more terrible than the official, legal sanction of bloodshed....” “you are quite right, it is more terrible,” porfiry agreed.
0xbd7cf4908717c90d6c2dc2f05ebc3c6b86f29595 “yes, you must have exaggerated!

0xedeadb716d8017be3b1597aa772a44a3d9b98073 “but the real geniuses,” asked razumihin frowning, “those who have the right to murder?

0xc7ce75fa5a3d8832c58ed2bc25ba779b60054d1b he will suffer if he is sorry for his victim.
0x19dcbfe4414f0fc54b22401dc7524e9f96059304 pain and suffering are always inevitable for a large intelligence and a deep heart.
0x309982f8db4ef9ffd268dfabb6e455dcfd3aaa72 the really great men must, i think, have great sadness on earth,” he added dreamily, not in the tone of the conversation.
0xf2e670ec80f9328404e19830fd771fef66a8856c he raised his eyes, looked earnestly at them all, smiled, and took his cap.
0x7508e350e9e02e5e5651f14d67cbf5df71f47f03 he was too quiet by comparison with his manner at his entrance, and he felt this.
0xe3a28f8f95f4c7b16f028f9232b968f58ada3586 everyone got up.
0x24176ceeb8b4fe2d8ba1b28f70f638c7b5922234 “well, you may abuse me, be angry with me if you like,” porfiry petrovitch began again, “but i can’t resist.
0x6e3a86361501a694c06684f16cb527274e50e0a4 allow me one little question (i know i am troubling you).
0x36dd1a4e49b9c222bbd7035f78b41609a6ac80d2 there is just one little notion i want to express, simply that i may not forget it.”
0xad039add9e743541a90074798fc5c9b7f81f42e7 “very good, tell me your little notion,” raskolnikov stood waiting, pale and grave before him.
0x5422d6805922917394c0e11f2f3d51c618bddc64 “well, you see... i really don’t know how to express it properly.... it’s a playful, psychological idea.... when you were writing your article, surely you couldn’t have helped, he-he!
0x9babb26946d87b887ad008f71a005eb566ede2f8 fancying yourself... just a little, an ‘extraordinary’ man, uttering a _new word_ in your sense.... that’s so, isn’t it?”
0x60ab8d825f7d6adf22cdf5877c68d39fdd91b49c “quite possibly,” raskolnikov answered contemptuously.
0xc6943ce5273f930d9ba412ff7e2c0116979982d7 razumihin made a movement.
0x3dbb109435da2aa8e79f4d38d5dad48d08b03a60 “and, if so, could you bring yourself in case of worldly difficulties and hardship or for some service to humanity--to overstep obstacles?... for instance, to rob and murder?”
0xa9a383f4ec10e237e15c66a6b36c717e4a4f2f83 and again he winked with his left eye, and laughed noiselessly just as before.
0xd8b2383d7851c1b731b54bb48e5da21f2254c642 “if i did i certainly should not tell you,” raskolnikov answered with defiant and haughty contempt.
0x5f74c78c8a897ff61c537be9768b7e228074b26f “no, i was only interested on account of your article, from a literary point of view...” “foo!
0x78741df4e8a8062c894719258ec14a9e6ab8d3fa how obvious and insolent that is!”
0x466df1ef9ca7f20d262c2dfb715f75e1a853a4e4 raskolnikov thought with repulsion.
0x5d9d92381c7f57046f47c2c2480900912bb42b71 “allow me to observe,” he answered dryly, “that i don’t consider myself a mahomet or a napoleon, nor any personage of that kind, and not being one of them i cannot tell you how i should act.”
0xad80f56694ba16dbfaffe13967ddeb90449d5843 “oh, come, don’t we all think ourselves napoleons now in russia?”
0xfc65065301cc966279a00773856f17024a3a54c7 porfiry petrovitch said with alarming familiarity.
0x838b59173b6cb0b2b9e9d88c5541a3f0a6c70148 something peculiar betrayed itself in the very intonation of his voice.
0xe696997615daecdd4f62ba06dd49c777e0ec4b08 “perhaps it was one of these future napoleons who did for alyona ivanovna last week?”
0x12e7210b166e4e5de80ce54168f4ed0591d0bab6 zametov blurted out from the corner.
0x2da313cd76d169028ba6d58405e404c101904f66 raskolnikov did not speak, but looked firmly and intently at porfiry.
0xf761812e4946b3338f3fcdd82efabd95d86b7186 razumihin was scowling gloomily.
0x0e85b587ca453e21ffb4de1a0866e34c78da43f2 he seemed before this to be noticing something.
0xf025863739384d09a0404b6eaba2cb338d3b9a53 he looked angrily around.
0xbe49117cf6c7d085acb1dcde3d35599dff30f16b there was a minute of gloomy silence.
0xb83f0f3d76bacae66f5e5054295d19b507280ca4 raskolnikov turned to go.
0xbfea2810f601e18784b14127b5b9ed207b858cf0 “are you going already?”
0xb0f62e76dd0c00bfdb4e00d646ca2212557813f0 porfiry said amiably, holding out his hand with excessive politeness.
0xccbd92844eec6c8987d6d8811b23edc78a7b26ea “very, very glad of your acquaintance.
0x3f074e7cd66dbc980f8feb5144a62cbc4c47ad28 as for your request, have no uneasiness, write just as i told you, or, better still, come to me there yourself in a day or two... to-morrow, indeed.
0xf333107b39828856a0c1dc308e2bfa51fa9bb39c i shall be there at eleven o’clock for certain.
0x18bdc908980f851e4c78aa26cd879aee7404643e we’ll arrange it all; we’ll have a talk.
0x7be05d86ab2cab97c2469c55e4c221f1ded15fe9 as one of the last to be _there_, you might perhaps be able to tell us something,” he added with a most good-natured expression.
0x74ca94a2aca7b219e8c9eac73d7545ceca1c9721 “you want to cross-examine me officially in due form?”
0xc0fbf3e50612164c02b2d6c95b14b756b2138b15 raskolnikov asked sharply.
0x731f0d3c96e791d3102dca2757617bb5452828b4 “oh, why?
0x7870ca66b8e85908b0e4f69b256d05fe49653181 that’s not necessary for the present.
0x76d3df0f60dc4e205d1ed2cfd783ab2b2ba927f6 you misunderstand me.
0x68a1665c5f8fa4f05e44fa5777988250a3167f50 i lose no opportunity, you see, and... i’ve talked with all who had pledges.... i obtained evidence from some of them, and you are the last.... yes, by the way,” he cried, seemingly suddenly delighted, “i just remember, what was i thinking of?”
0xe2ba95455069fa185d6d1d142772c7a4e00a46d0 he turned to razumihin, “you were talking my ears off about that nikolay... of course, i know, i know very well,” he turned to raskolnikov, “that the fellow is innocent, but what is one to do?
0x06ee8e61e1ee82866f153f01dd83a647844cecac we had to trouble dmitri too.... this is the point, this is all: when you went up the stairs it was past seven, wasn’t it?”
0x01e2361a0272e19e1c35aea471abe01c0476354a “yes,” answered raskolnikov, with an unpleasant sensation at the very moment he spoke that he need not have said it.
0xe1a831b0d546c51af8f961b38b382d9130cfe531 “then when you went upstairs between seven and eight, didn’t you see in a flat that stood open on a second storey, do you remember?
0xb04aee5cc109894fb764a41dbf1138caa3b2fd94 two workmen or at least one of them?
0xb539fcd8fcd1642fbdc0f77e6cc51ac9d4bec44a they were painting there, didn’t you notice them?
0xbe1f7defe51fdf16ec7ecde7479b39b5c0146e86 it’s very, very important for them.”
0x1173b4046623d38a64f81376ab23fc176257c102 “painters?
0xdc8c32c315349f13f9e041146374cfc072971286 no, i didn’t see them,” raskolnikov answered slowly, as though ransacking his memory, while at the same instant he was racking every nerve, almost swooning with anxiety to conjecture as quickly as possible where the trap lay and not to overlook anything.
0x98d6715d93422c9e88ad139895c6c7a581972d4b “no, i didn’t see them, and i don’t think i noticed a flat like that open.... but on the fourth storey” (he had mastered the trap now and was triumphant) “i remember now that someone was moving out of the flat opposite alyona ivanovna’s.... i remember... i remember it clearly.
0x17c7b2ce5ed52633b19d98cb728314a599d6710f some porters were carrying out a sofa and they squeezed me against the wall.
0x3b7a4443ba8148110f9b9ed30aa152453405385d but painters... no, i don’t remember that there were any painters, and i don’t think that there was a flat open anywhere, no, there wasn’t.”
0xbf88212b1ff5a8b9eaea9de92afa0c41e4b69ed7 “what do you mean?”
0x787f630b1f0f66bc408c0e0899d840dc486af49d razumihin shouted suddenly, as though he had reflected and realised.
0xaeebcfcee016d3b305ba911763761f805ce05169 “why, it was on the day of the murder the painters were at work, and he was there three days before?
0xf3481483c005b3332fab2e2da2a83a9ec2a01388 what are you asking?”
0xf1c20dfa1779e7ddf69904d77a544b6e47effa51 “foo!
0x6a7a593382468112e8b28e94e48874177ff1bec1 i have muddled it!”
0x3c519dbd200fcc914f20938afd2a17ceabb0c91f porfiry slapped himself on the forehead.
0xeb04ebee986f9f3f455f7aa773f74736e66808da “deuce take it!
0x0debeef7b537d3a1eca12e137b50bf30cb73dda6 this business is turning my brain!”
0x0b8c3d2fbaa127262ff5fc2d9fabe29224f9d4f9 he addressed raskolnikov somewhat apologetically.
0xcca9a6dc978793e017bcca0549d839cee7470dff “it would be such a great thing for us to find out whether anyone had seen them between seven and eight at the flat, so i fancied you could perhaps have told us something.... i quite muddled it.”
0x463dde4d375d0171fdb2e6ef89681b708386ad1c “then you should be more careful,” razumihin observed grimly.
0x19eca006fcac5a83e9e665ab13450bb02f71ce04 the last words were uttered in the passage.
0xc4f9bb0384af74ee1cb83696e78a0d772cf9fa40 porfiry petrovitch saw them to the door with excessive politeness.
0xf6e8e779be80cd8b3fbf4f3ec894ec3e282c9316 they went out into the street gloomy and sullen, and for some steps they did not say a word.
0x6262962292a4c2dc04c3e3de595df6107a72cadd raskolnikov drew a deep breath.
0x9858d69674d6de431f17dbb51f55a1decb030561 chapter vi “i don’t believe it, i can’t believe it!”
0x735a0e4b2b2946ffaa23403f658cc1c4f438bc90 repeated razumihin, trying in perplexity to refute raskolnikov’s arguments.
0xf6b84196135f61ee6dd2ffb6160d40a09ed14bdb they were by now approaching bakaleyev’s lodgings, where pulcheria alexandrovna and dounia had been expecting them a long while.
0x19d778fbe981455e7abfd14e297a0d1498a43a82 razumihin kept stopping on the way in the heat of discussion, confused and excited by the very fact that they were for the first time speaking openly about _it_.
0x4dd88e4b3544712ed9a3e54ab9072aeb2b70af63 “don’t believe it, then!”
0x72674fcf1c011f0c8109a9793db69a38deb51f5f answered raskolnikov, with a cold, careless smile.
0x9936544fb854981525b6ab7541dccbf11b4cf26c “you were noticing nothing as usual, but i was weighing every word.”
0x8c8f98f4250147d02b0236e9c048326db33338dd “you are suspicious.
0x3f4fc32b522d4aa803cd8ce9e7d97997630426bd that is why you weighed their words... h’m... certainly, i agree, porfiry’s tone was rather strange, and still more that wretch zametov!... you are right, there was something about him--but why?
0x9d2d308f9dd3c36583792d0b7012e4f511b13634 why?”
0x5676a0a283ca1d53e3406b0e37ac7e197620a81f “he has changed his mind since last night.”
0x91cc93e88720ad9087268a90b740da70115d3fe4 “quite the contrary!
0xba63de2f46fc6eb1bae2ad5b6b293a4728b02222 if they had that brainless idea, they would do their utmost to hide it, and conceal their cards, so as to catch you afterwards.... but it was all impudent and careless.”
0x95bf86a247fd20db4d899d50d87b8ca8f2047e9b “if they had had facts--i mean, real facts--or at least grounds for suspicion, then they would certainly have tried to hide their game, in the hope of getting more (they would have made a search long ago besides).
0x072fee88c848d9687379ee298b5375edcad40eb2 but they have no facts, not one.
0x40ef3235a81adca81801ee1df38087a0e109f19a it is all mirage--all ambiguous.
0xd8cc694806109996a56cda0a8aff4a2db2f0e860 simply a floating idea.
0xccfef641ad8beb86b78635a8ac3aa4b0abe833b1 so they try to throw me out by impudence.
0x645a78ada9deada09b7680bd829f484ee26d5366 and perhaps, he was irritated at having no facts, and blurted it out in his vexation--or perhaps he has some plan... he seems an intelligent man.
0x86a10bc69dd8cd51f659da381ade3da4781b2099 perhaps he wanted to frighten me by pretending to know.
0xcb5b78ad1c76dd445daefbd53b3a32c20c424ac7 they have a psychology of their own, brother.
0xc8153ff8d82d7636d9c35944ea0b57bf5467b753 but it is loathsome explaining it all.

0x62a3585db9e89e42fadb18fff4879501d82b80c5 “and it’s insulting, insulting!

0x212f58532b8dc9a694481af529155db1f2a36910 but... since we have spoken openly now (and it is an excellent thing that we have at last--i am glad) i will own now frankly that i noticed it in them long ago, this idea.
0x77a0195afd4498f41c93932fe9f75b71cf31feee of course the merest hint only--an insinuation--but why an insinuation even?

0xd16e3ab646921fde4b906cdf43375a66ca429f04 simply because a poor student, unhinged by poverty and hypochondria, on the eve of a severe delirious illness (note that), suspicious, vain, proud, who has not seen a soul to speak to for six months, in rags and in boots without soles, has to face some wretched policemen and put up with their insolence; and the unexpected debt thrust under his nose, the i.o.u. presented by tchebarov, the new paint, thirty degrees reaumur and a stifling atmosphere, a crowd of people, the talk about the murder of a person where he had been just before, and all that on an empty stomach--he might well have a fainting fit!
0x3a69d38b77e84f47ebf4113d79966838355db1fe and that, that is what they found it all on!

0x17aea327696cd91916b6831741c23bf175dcebba raskolnikov could not help laughing.
0x26dfae97dca1e5983f2b86a6aa88cb96023f906e but at the very moment, he was struck by the strangeness of his own frankness, and the eagerness with which he had made this explanation, though he had kept up all the preceding conversation with gloomy repulsion, obviously with a motive, from necessity.
0xec63d8642b1dcacf10cce712b0fd8f2bc1c8a520 “i am getting a relish for certain aspects!”
0xa3718116e08d6cce7c24113e785d687422bf7f42 he thought to himself.
0xa12fcde4d9abe192bd4664472c22695be9ba0c5c but almost at the same instant he became suddenly uneasy, as though an unexpected and alarming idea had occurred to him.
0x5c2a754b940e02518043f6c519b8ca363764b9d2 his uneasiness kept on increasing.
0x6d6ca441f2ea2a5aaf28ef3383305090e81b07d8 they had just reached the entrance to bakaleyev’s.
0x4100f912bdcec4c56e62131d9d525d5b5d758c9f “go in alone!”
0x9838b2128f0225115bf3d32d31cf0694ddc22013 said raskolnikov suddenly.
0xfb035a707b9a305f2a12c468b49f67e256992c9a “i will be back directly.”
0xadfc6697bde7ddfe3e7772c0c7a4306ab3572cd2 “where are you going?
0x8f718849a5310b51a3c9533ea2109ea2c719bf44 why, we are just here.”
0x49e365b97d4ab8a5ad9e26846bf99570c1eb0c6d “i can’t help it.... i will come in half an hour.

0xe13b0c6881b80364336d31fbdc1b6742b6de22de “say what you like, i will come with you.”
0x45e093f800078fdb8d76a496c743324bb8c902ec “you, too, want to torture me!”
0xdba395a54dc890fec6017d9f39da71b26e28d233 he screamed, with such bitter irritation, such despair in his eyes that razumihin’s hands dropped.
0xbe811515497f29eb0f548f5b6e5aa39a20a9209c he stood for some time on the steps, looking gloomily at raskolnikov striding rapidly away in the direction of his lodging.
0x8a830c80fef3279c7df75d63e425204121850b5c at last, gritting his teeth and clenching his fist, he swore he would squeeze porfiry like a lemon that very day, and went up the stairs to reassure pulcheria alexandrovna, who was by now alarmed at their long absence.
0x215a54cbfbc4fa2b19ca1dba5bc31525f55df15e when raskolnikov got home, his hair was soaked with sweat and he was breathing heavily.
0x95363d545e83583129e1352edf321f930720232b he went rapidly up the stairs, walked into his unlocked room and at once fastened the latch.
0x30c929f45d7159a96d07e2efb36cf0c788906855 then in senseless terror he rushed to the corner, to that hole under the paper where he had put the things; put his hand in, and for some minutes felt carefully in the hole, in every crack and fold of the paper.
0x872e628cc56b153b73c6adc4197b8bc0d45df2ef finding nothing, he got up and drew a deep breath.
0x6e9a8f9e4959b2868d39d4b30737f2824c4321ed as he was reaching the steps of bakaleyev’s, he suddenly fancied that something, a chain, a stud or even a bit of paper in which they had been wrapped with the old woman’s handwriting on it, might somehow have slipped out and been lost in some crack, and then might suddenly turn up as unexpected, conclusive evidence against him.
0x8f69dcf24d71ef5be25c288729381d1085c489ae he stood as though lost in thought, and a strange, humiliated, half senseless smile strayed on his lips.
0x83a71bd56d09ebfc7e919c8c72d008ba185b885f he took his cap at last and went quietly out of the room.
0xd75e8fcbfcdf37644586ce2fa620b2d8a5fc3939 his ideas were all tangled.
0xc326f9e08cffc5a27a6e54882f8e67f1e81320af he went dreamily through the gateway.
0x70a29ad605eb089fbb0d8eedb90c1eb9135f3ff2 “here he is himself,” shouted a loud voice.
0x7b814eafcd2147d87affa60a67a8a6f92ebf18b5 he raised his head.
0x3532961470ffcbbdefe990a46f488f21e109de17 the porter was standing at the door of his little room and was pointing him out to a short man who looked like an artisan, wearing a long coat and a waistcoat, and looking at a distance remarkably like a woman.
0x74f404f6c97ce04a5c017f7684072e5215634f4c he stooped, and his head in a greasy cap hung forward.
0x4b8a111bd79eb80a5938d6f77136540d2b832f95 from his wrinkled flabby face he looked over fifty; his little eyes were lost in fat and they looked out grimly, sternly and discontentedly.
0xf7421ecf93fec117c5974f6568bf915fd84f7750 “what is it?”
0xf8ddb681235692ad7e08b6f01fb1a4953b2d3088 raskolnikov asked, going up to the porter.
0x4c1d9f5c8922541e4b342721a6c48eecf2f5498a the man stole a look at him from under his brows and he looked at him attentively, deliberately; then he turned slowly and went out of the gate into the street without saying a word.
0xf7421ecf93fec117c5974f6568bf915fd84f7750 “what is it?”
0x7b8b6091ba58f4640a164803487c404180d15f9d cried raskolnikov.
0x20e88747d587cd64b9741a64ce5cac162983e9b5 “why, he there was asking whether a student lived here, mentioned your name and whom you lodged with.
0x366024d058caea7a9adb7dae0760923029fcfa4e i saw you coming and pointed you out and he went away.
0x8cf8032b27198d77d1da21c006512c9080e82989 it’s funny.”
0x9aefc20206833bf06300d6cebe558068b7f6a091 the porter too seemed rather puzzled, but not much so, and after wondering for a moment he turned and went back to his room.
0x166d91229c82f5cfcdfcacc11bc061775722eb07 raskolnikov ran after the stranger, and at once caught sight of him walking along the other side of the street with the same even, deliberate step with his eyes fixed on the ground, as though in meditation.
0x384ccf590717d539b923fbcfb2830b82a836da89 he soon overtook him, but for some time walked behind him.
0x481062c8dcdd32ceff9f911ac266cf33a50232cd at last, moving on to a level with him, he looked at his face.
0xf468c26a5372c877cd01a74bf1c285fd3fa377c1 the man noticed him at once, looked at him quickly, but dropped his eyes again; and so they walked for a minute side by side without uttering a word.
0xfb7754e8366902f77caf9ed2f3dfe422bff8c662 “you were inquiring for me... of the porter?”
0x556e595769c2ae605d904856a7d9b946711e5f47 raskolnikov said at last, but in a curiously quiet voice.
0xfb64fd5b5abf6a06dfc7617d4d858ea8c68cfd20 the man made no answer; he didn’t even look at him.
0xa6ed925e7eaa8eab8d2dfff46ec1c478636e58ce again they were both silent.
0xbaa2f6da5513b3c496410e6d78f34c5487159b33 “why do you... come and ask for me... and say nothing.... what’s the meaning of it?”
0x7cd3387ba5ca4b4697f96a701275323430110fd6 raskolnikov’s voice broke and he seemed unable to articulate the words clearly.
0xb253a1d2f266fc3aa89c7cd75a9f446ce35c7086 the man raised his eyes this time and turned a gloomy sinister look at raskolnikov.
0x83b99488982062c559100da969a111c9642c156b “murderer!”
0x9ab27835e5c749c53dcec18357c8598244a117a0 he said suddenly in a quiet but clear and distinct voice.
0xf25749db939630509d70909ec901f079e5d31668 raskolnikov went on walking beside him.
0xa9f60dfdbcb40aab810abca002d5b18ac921bc51 his legs felt suddenly weak, a cold shiver ran down his spine, and his heart seemed to stand still for a moment, then suddenly began throbbing as though it were set free.
0xa5c6784b4559f2bdb898edb63a7a8510e5f2e554 so they walked for about a hundred paces, side by side in silence.
0x6ab48b15b4bbac458a93e20fa378a996f8b0e189 the man did not look at him.
0xe59feee2e4df1b985a82c820b47b9fcdab35d926 “what do you mean... what is.... who is a murderer?”
0xf788e0d12a68f61468543f8552830298ca812b33 muttered raskolnikov hardly audibly.
0x50ad5343ce3315b928298138aa34962227fa0a67 “_you_ are a murderer,” the man answered still more articulately and emphatically, with a smile of triumphant hatred, and again he looked straight into raskolnikov’s pale face and stricken eyes.
0xc454e0be30a87554bf66bcad84c16b3bc2140361 they had just reached the cross-roads.
0x44412571bcae06b2e2836418f148795372c71389 the man turned to the left without looking behind him.
0xd1617aa34b96f0364f10f3659f3e0ecc48debb2c raskolnikov remained standing, gazing after him.
0x0ba9e94ea6de564240c8209307f5ec810800724b he saw him turn round fifty paces away and look back at him still standing there.
0x2ae6ce2d8908a66c35a89058c22bb7465b9b2661 raskolnikov could not see clearly, but he fancied that he was again smiling the same smile of cold hatred and triumph.
0xc5c5d3b4c36a7d67f8d08befbb888755080ff34c with slow faltering steps, with shaking knees, raskolnikov made his way back to his little garret, feeling chilled all over.
0xfee65ae761ac10053f21f94468b19dd7cfa1ad1a he took off his cap and put it on the table, and for ten minutes he stood without moving.
0xf41dfa7bb9380a9f324c35e51efc9ab5137de874 then he sank exhausted on the sofa and with a weak moan of pain he stretched himself on it.
0x1106af69538dc72194a6cd5aaaea9c755fd68e22 so he lay for half an hour.
0x86aa187a0af60091115596c18c19bf37d9fcde3d he thought of nothing.
0xea6e56669d7160de3d91939d34eb1d7efda177dc some thoughts or fragments of thoughts, some images without order or coherence floated before his mind--faces of people he had seen in his childhood or met somewhere once, whom he would never have recalled, the belfry of the church at v., the billiard table in a restaurant and some officers playing billiards, the smell of cigars in some underground tobacco shop, a tavern room, a back staircase quite dark, all sloppy with dirty water and strewn with egg-shells, and the sunday bells floating in from somewhere.... the images followed one another, whirling like a hurricane.
0xa7af9ffbc6a19deb685d4adb14289ad7abd29f0a some of them he liked and tried to clutch at, but they faded and all the while there was an oppression within him, but it was not overwhelming, sometimes it was even pleasant.... the slight shivering still persisted, but that too was an almost pleasant sensation.
0x768c4e0b5f016d0070186416db54165e58f292bf he heard the hurried footsteps of razumihin; he closed his eyes and pretended to be asleep.
0x0b80ea46d441bed28e42c3a8f7115b5700185720 razumihin opened the door and stood for some time in the doorway as though hesitating, then he stepped softly into the room and went cautiously to the sofa.
0xa8de1af3d391acbdc26ec898a4bfed70c95f39e3 raskolnikov heard nastasya’s whisper: “don’t disturb him!
0xda7dce44dd12649ce0cd64a93d175cb9880fad84 let him sleep.
0x0e4c664c1db0589f92fcb4cf668b66d7bf5cee62 he can have his dinner later.”
0xfa2c6e4f30a7671e76032f2d8506f9a8affff801 “quite so,” answered razumihin.
0xa05f35e0d22c4f1f89113e9096fa923be1a6a7ef both withdrew carefully and closed the door.
0xad2b7df3834b0874de76564053ee5052cc996d4a another half-hour passed.
0x30ea2654e9f5d3869366dab7586e607316f022be raskolnikov opened his eyes, turned on his back again, clasping his hands behind his head.
0xdbc449b60ffd1a3ee99f9340986646cabe1b64c3 “who is he?
0x491383202d5c3f9424da694ec89f1490220a20f0 who is that man who sprang out of the earth?
0x0bdae749ffe61e45f6f84c374dafe7c404ce5c34 where was he, what did he see?
0xb44397e35b69598df06f865d1628c32d46ac75ad he has seen it all, that’s clear.
0xd5e5987d769b4d87573ea7d99baa28687207fa24 where was he then?
0xfed7f8127f7b753b7ae933c7ee8f561bc3c8e135 and from where did he see?
0x70d1248feb40857f7c9899e9b61c1ddbfd53626e why has he only now sprung out of the earth?
0x36534b0e1300ecd43ab4eae1246c750620b5717a and how could he see?
0x46955ebbc64885b338010555c3b3ed5954f9d4d2 is it possible?
0xeccdb6f9ea4574f9e101c3581db9b2614651d1f2 hm...” continued raskolnikov, turning cold and shivering, “and the jewel case nikolay found behind the door--was that possible?
0xe2215a85ee621f9f4722796aee45a9ab38f18924 a clue?
0xa1c7950e618d6bfe6984bdc53bb39bedd01e200f you miss an infinitesimal line and you can build it into a pyramid of evidence!
0xa5b575339dd0d3712399fe1bd25fb6d215d6abf5 a fly flew by and saw it!
0x64184f18687d584f2a40b0038d8a4a56e943c17f is it possible?”
0x88f947cf490588ca6ea4b0f5667d213686b9b61e he felt with sudden loathing how weak, how physically weak he had become.
0xcfc24466988ec1f945e2fa64a0771c8506a347e8 “i ought to have known it,” he thought with a bitter smile.
0x61d7dde1d34241963643d9b04d76685adf5c650d “and how dared i, knowing myself, knowing how i should be, take up an axe and shed blood!
0x04957209f385710764a5b832f5e631f24643b223 i ought to have known beforehand.... ah, but i did know!”
0x77fdf1e082cece9e10638625b0899c7efd137ce3 he whispered in despair.
0xe0a2b65f9be91cee840d71f38c1c403847c48e1d at times he came to a standstill at some thought.
0x09a5bd7f4d2fdc6e6f0de37a183595425839d952 “no, those men are not made so.
0xd9a8aea2ee78f3bd9ce55bdee9161965216ebb52 the real _master_ to whom all is permitted storms toulon, makes a massacre in paris, _forgets_ an army in egypt, _wastes_ half a million men in the moscow expedition and gets off with a jest at vilna.

0x280baae9dbec3c68fd8d0a54ff682cb688dee818 one sudden irrelevant idea almost made him laugh.
0x0cf972801bae4cc244ef6b9513d1e6a917377824 napoleon, the pyramids, waterloo, and a wretched skinny old woman, a pawnbroker with a red trunk under her bed--it’s a nice hash for porfiry petrovitch to digest!

0xa37d20bd27308f6aeabf9f321a7e137b42b60de2 at moments he felt he was raving.
0xcc0f10ca01c1a594edaa73448b3720e35bf84123 he sank into a state of feverish excitement.
0xf4ad3833aec22044ad32e6a824d0dc9a773cfeb2 “the old woman is of no consequence,” he thought, hotly and incoherently.
0x226125e9d8cb90043b5125c2dbd1ee83da805877 “the old woman was a mistake perhaps, but she is not what matters!

0x78ed90715a15498eef68ae5422d23c9dddd3b5dc i only live once, i too want.... ech, i am an æsthetic louse and nothing more,” he added suddenly, laughing like a madman.
0xe287cfd69a105e0601546fbc0f0cf3358c992e03 “yes, i am certainly a louse,” he went on, clutching at the idea, gloating over it and playing with it with vindictive pleasure.
0x9db4847cf658bb3b79a5b4b2813dd9aa119ed7e3 “in the first place, because i can reason that i am one, and secondly, because for a month past i have been troubling benevolent providence, calling it to witness that not for my own fleshly lusts did i undertake it, but with a grand and noble object--ha-ha!
0x7986603136460ac5133aff44b770f54cd06527ec thirdly, because i aimed at carrying it out as justly as possible, weighing, measuring and calculating.

0xbe6cffdf873cc59246926b7290a52e0c82365f94 and what shows that i am utterly a louse,” he added, grinding his teeth, “is that i am perhaps viler and more loathsome than the louse i killed, and _i felt beforehand_ that i should tell myself so _after_ killing her.
0xe2c8545f5ee96a11cf6b9017db35a85d370e243e can anything be compared with the horror of that?

0x5a65ad02c25d2a8d496ee811e314349e6b30b5b3 the ‘prophet’ is right, he is right when he sets a battery across the street and blows up the innocent and the guilty without deigning to explain!

0xb94cd650a320ea416e1fe9e1f5297ef4cde278b6 his hair was soaked with sweat, his quivering lips were parched, his eyes were fixed on the ceiling.
0xf7cd17addfb29aaf97f4b8a1043d59a59708b16e “mother, sister--how i loved them!

0xb5775adb4d81a1c74a86737f6cbb5a907a9572d9 he lost consciousness; it seemed strange to him that he didn’t remember how he got into the street.
0x099c39f26245aac2c4f3ed0995cfd5da550ca4bf it was late evening.
0xd5a6c036ec8afe11483e7c524db6c9cfcba17248 the twilight had fallen and the full moon was shining more and more brightly; but there was a peculiar breathlessness in the air.
0xeaa180a8fba113858047e8c1473be77f78a3db79 there were crowds of people in the street; workmen and business people were making their way home; other people had come out for a walk; there was a smell of mortar, dust and stagnant water.
0x284dd554cef791deee00d9e336d17dd42c233801 raskolnikov walked along, mournful and anxious; he was distinctly aware of having come out with a purpose, of having to do something in a hurry, but what it was he had forgotten.
0xdb745f1fe9130feeb7f3570575ce2a759de4008a suddenly he stood still and saw a man standing on the other side of the street, beckoning to him.
0x35f29971d56dfd6bc54bec90fbcfd9954f117e96 he crossed over to him, but at once the man turned and walked away with his head hanging, as though he had made no sign to him.
0xbb00b544c5bb17cc61aa9142d4471d46e502530e “stay, did he really beckon?”
0xfb4d187be09f143cf439b06034e50abd66166959 raskolnikov wondered, but he tried to overtake him.
0xad47c05288450de543a21ec804101aadb49a34db when he was within ten paces he recognised him and was frightened; it was the same man with stooping shoulders in the long coat.
0x9842331e5eb068455f62fb8244c83f2d369cbbbd raskolnikov followed him at a distance; his heart was beating; they went down a turning; the man still did not look round.
0x930a94284d6967f0c485cfedf2b517ae67069274 “does he know i am following him?”
0x04972745030d82cebc4335a41e35f125f4ecfa67 thought raskolnikov.
0x1d7b9fdafaf7d212e4f7bf313b27fc2698444732 the man went into the gateway of a big house.
0x8a85260d1be974e0f7b0f778500a1e6a003716e0 raskolnikov hastened to the gate and looked in to see whether he would look round and sign to him.
0x06a2b6182629beddf8facaa1275e406ebf064393 in the court-yard the man did turn round and again seemed to beckon him.
0xea57ec03374530ebf416478db7b483536096df6c raskolnikov at once followed him into the yard, but the man was gone.
0x2474cdd13b3c4133486892c5157e0af0ddc8b93f he must have gone up the first staircase.
0xc4d6da27fc7567857b06dd5f2f8cee0319e2c1e4 raskolnikov rushed after him.
0xd3f75a4cba64491dec86823207ee1ac503ef1e16 he heard slow measured steps two flights above.
0xb2c04973adece82add3bfd2ec6c30f556b62243b the staircase seemed strangely familiar.
0x040158b7bb221e2930f3fa6749d3aa3fe6caf2b8 he reached the window on the first floor; the moon shone through the panes with a melancholy and mysterious light; then he reached the second floor.
0x0cf87980b6ccbfa97a80c6661b8e769f1de660ef bah!
0xde20a5e107fce67cc490c8a7c23ba4692a1bd430 this is the flat where the painters were at work... but how was it he did not recognise it at once?
0x3b8521cc73c376bfbf4aa8986d706718035d5bd6 the steps of the man above had died away.
0x11bd7c0e5d73a2f26369566c78280b8e9fcc4c02 “so he must have stopped or hidden somewhere.”
0x8507e423d0044dbcb511528c8843f4ce6e46ae4e he reached the third storey, should he go on?
0x80fc01b6a7de0003064c4545bf14a9e1f37b30d9 there was a stillness that was dreadful.... but he went on.
0x4663e24208102b4567c0c85205acc489e27fe580 the sound of his own footsteps scared and frightened him.
0x70cd2a6ce8a12fd050ab2ccd1a9574f2e604c047 how dark it was!
0x3f56a819e331176898eee469a9334cb407f9f79f the man must be hiding in some corner here.
0x660160464ed2bf20c4c2451b079a19eb0b74df25 ah!
0x986e9d57b3074b6e6772354cc37fc8c6a2992552 the flat was standing wide open, he hesitated and went in.
0x6bc197b60a58d409c0b2974511c4599df7ce6645 it was very dark and empty in the passage, as though everything had been removed; he crept on tiptoe into the parlour which was flooded with moonlight.
0x32581332a62967c6f6d722b97e5076fd1b0a85c1 everything there was as before, the chairs, the looking-glass, the yellow sofa and the pictures in the frames.
0xd415eef079a157a7e7f408246677338a5272c14c a huge, round, copper-red moon looked in at the windows.
0xf6b843576052da1fa1afc8d1e6f923eaecf31f60 “it’s the moon that makes it so still, weaving some mystery,” thought raskolnikov.
0x3fd00b1e43371b91dcef224e15bd1eefc2941356 he stood and waited, waited a long while, and the more silent the moonlight, the more violently his heart beat, till it was painful.
0x3f74256340f4b82de5cacc5666bfa155b11a65f4 and still the same hush.
0x59fa54172aa95706287c189c03a35e2310e120ec suddenly he heard a momentary sharp crack like the snapping of a splinter and all was still again.
0x65f55ef7db437b3e0ffa7f15b1fae0d2994669b7 a fly flew up suddenly and struck the window pane with a plaintive buzz.
0x8076bf69d95287166b90eedcbf1b161734182dc7 at that moment he noticed in the corner between the window and the little cupboard something like a cloak hanging on the wall.
0xb6d5abe0865b2aa5f242d4c42cfcd09f8feb4c7e “why is that cloak here?”
0x7897c822df5547cf3c48019a650b15f47e871e65 he thought, “it wasn’t there before....” he went up to it quietly and felt that there was someone hiding behind it.
0x9be4dff8ec35dc7767cccee117134ef9d032e345 he cautiously moved the cloak and saw, sitting on a chair in the corner, the old woman bent double so that he couldn’t see her face; but it was she.
0x349bf4dafa70acbb925c0cd97080c6d3abaae039 he stood over her.
0xef9946361087ee201dfc9c166cac3500fb55220e “she is afraid,” he thought.
0x28f4e72df2cb7c1e39a2d4d0e1b3047c57b9b07a he stealthily took the axe from the noose and struck her one blow, then another on the skull.
0xd09b6d950464b66cd5cb546d701ae464b7d26e91 but strange to say she did not stir, as though she were made of wood.
0xc2b77897110725908ac22d5a2d21cca274e9c93f he was frightened, bent down nearer and tried to look at her; but she, too, bent her head lower.
0xfb1e562ce15f858608a90b77c18d44f58704f7a8 he bent right down to the ground and peeped up into her face from below, he peeped and turned cold with horror: the old woman was sitting and laughing, shaking with noiseless laughter, doing her utmost that he should not hear it.
0xf3aa02199864618187ed2e657027093f3142f8a0 suddenly he fancied that the door from the bedroom was opened a little and that there was laughter and whispering within.
0x94d8ef8d48f8735ca50c9fb1f4b68dcca6f25adf he was overcome with frenzy and he began hitting the old woman on the head with all his force, but at every blow of the axe the laughter and whispering from the bedroom grew louder and the old woman was simply shaking with mirth.
0xeb4348fd36734e87ed5a46e0fcf1a9449f21cd00 he was rushing away, but the passage was full of people, the doors of the flats stood open and on the landing, on the stairs and everywhere below there were people, rows of heads, all looking, but huddled together in silence and expectation.
0x1faebfae99d6386e5cf53ea6a321e3e42e338980 something gripped his heart, his legs were rooted to the spot, they would not move.... he tried to scream and woke up.
0x325966a6919ed5c1b7dfe3d9e4809dd655503641 he drew a deep breath--but his dream seemed strangely to persist: his door was flung open and a man whom he had never seen stood in the doorway watching him intently.
0x70e290d079a55b15c036d1ce54e0a05f53bed642 raskolnikov had hardly opened his eyes and he instantly closed them again.
0xb9ecf4959e4b5fc0a168b9ed5616506a6836c68f he lay on his back without stirring.
0xfed287d716b2d523fb09354a85b646549798a35b “is it still a dream?”
0xc61885c176e3fba5010d2b059e3e2a43df5fedad he wondered and again raised his eyelids hardly perceptibly; the stranger was standing in the same place, still watching him.
0xe234fcdefde78fbd1144d803b69f095ec6a0c504 he stepped cautiously into the room, carefully closing the door after him, went up to the table, paused a moment, still keeping his eyes on raskolnikov, and noiselessly seated himself on the chair by the sofa; he put his hat on the floor beside him and leaned his hands on his cane and his chin on his hands.
0xda2ebac924b8ab66575f6da8947537e68900085c it was evident that he was prepared to wait indefinitely.
0x0d7644de27caa334099ef4dd6d3e6b899da09d5b as far as raskolnikov could make out from his stolen glances, he was a man no longer young, stout, with a full, fair, almost whitish beard.
0x8ffc1e745d85d3e1c394fa3b2606304a992566c8 ten minutes passed.
0x601312f7fcb5805da038b891951d8f30e599d4b7 it was still light, but beginning to get dusk.
0x13183f91f19b8cfa74741daf9f6364e943ae86c4 there was complete stillness in the room.
0x819209dc0929af46300bb921163c73dc73fe6ee3 not a sound came from the stairs.
0x395eef18d98972ad98034129bd3989b79951ba68 only a big fly buzzed and fluttered against the window pane.
0x6e7a35bf12ed3ca5fab44db6b9851893f708ca00 it was unbearable at last.
0x0e52eb9ab9d1c10755e46b4788455ffe36d80bc7 raskolnikov suddenly got up and sat on the sofa.
0x005d4440cd100590bf101edbe9505a0cb0e6670c “come, tell me what you want.”
0xa2e95342002ff37ae265772fa7f92d6165f0ba49 “i knew you were not asleep, but only pretending,” the stranger answered oddly, laughing calmly.
0x8c1c404a2a545e2345cb9fa66270c550a1063aa5 “arkady ivanovitch svidrigaïlov, allow me to introduce myself....” part iv chapter i “can this be still a dream?”
0x32075c138fff6591acca416308b338db2fede1af raskolnikov thought once more.
0x81130650c2bf8f87d56fd4a769cf6f458e0b3573 he looked carefully and suspiciously at the unexpected visitor.
0xb22563dda029ecdb72fd91c445c29db0b69353f6 “svidrigaïlov!
0x6770e1d64e55ba5df53bb34e7e66e86f33f00d38 what nonsense!
0xc5be1ec89ac91ee688331c4aee3268221c9176f6 it can’t be!”
0x5a57bb07e41c6e578a01293490acccb10a6a4ca5 he said at last aloud in bewilderment.
0x467e969a7a4b4af39363e0563d19a79683d63f00 his visitor did not seem at all surprised at this exclamation.
0x417292ba536910f65302421e432475cf52fa2155 “i’ve come to you for two reasons.
0xf2c459dd31ce95c4a4667a4f548fa413d8b3c1bd in the first place, i wanted to make your personal acquaintance, as i have already heard a great deal about you that is interesting and flattering; secondly, i cherish the hope that you may not refuse to assist me in a matter directly concerning the welfare of your sister, avdotya romanovna.
0x10823920fddb13a0a50c7dc2ffff75302503ec73 for without your support she might not let me come near her now, for she is prejudiced against me, but with your assistance i reckon on...” “you reckon wrongly,” interrupted raskolnikov.
0x9e93c00f9643847017d35ba3990b44b709577b79 “they only arrived yesterday, may i ask you?”
0x272cb23cd9b8e01a5cfadd064f361f0b906e7bad raskolnikov made no reply.
0xc73794bd82ff63de86e26c2c01946bb34a8cfc54 “it was yesterday, i know.
0x26fb29b0489adc72086457805f6959941ccedd60 i only arrived myself the day before.

0x6fa9d701770632da6b81dc3689baa50c273d4c19 raskolnikov continued to look at him in silence.
0x3be9aff5873a36b48668ad9281da5319706daf7b “that in my own house i persecuted a defenceless girl and ‘insulted her with my infamous proposals’--is that it?
0x872a4228573832c3e41b7ae4f3d5ea0dccfabad3 (i am anticipating you.)
0xcbb659eb7b15faeb02f3e05ac5ba5a1a5c8d96d4 but you’ve only to assume that i, too, am a man _et nihil humanum_... in a word, that i am capable of being attracted and falling in love (which does not depend on our will), then everything can be explained in the most natural manner.
0x4e245f01d28c9290ecaffbf0571257e57ba4276c the question is, am i a monster, or am i myself a victim?
0x1188ce14917aa3dcc0bce1a94c8d361329b4ccc0 and what if i am a victim?
0x1dd633596d2751fe7764d314d1395a40bfd10f18 in proposing to the object of my passion to elope with me to america or switzerland, i may have cherished the deepest respect for her and may have thought that i was promoting our mutual happiness!
0xdeb144d65489186358cd2c2f1201a5953f30de73 reason is the slave of passion, you know; why, probably, i was doing more harm to myself than anyone!”
0x0ea7083c903860dcabfc24fd9f38b7fa2e5c5358 “but that’s not the point,” raskolnikov interrupted with disgust.
0x4218deb82270171acac9b598d0c8ec6ee27a451d “it’s simply that whether you are right or wrong, we dislike you.
0x74c9dadf881c3f38d4d71777ab59d58756a2a40b we don’t want to have anything to do with you.

0x0e7d73713de8bb96dc02cdbd06e5ff9f49452265 svidrigaïlov broke into a sudden laugh.
0xabe6344e48dfd2c68aff6f247f485ff78bc710b5 “but you’re... but there’s no getting round you,” he said, laughing in the frankest way.

0x7dcd3a21901a0e780e45d8e8155a28beb896e7c5 cried svidrigaïlov, laughing openly.
0x27f46b9847c17704ed311263e446b76f506c416a “but this is what the french call _bonne guerre_, and the most innocent form of deception!... but still you have interrupted me; one way or another, i repeat again: there would never have been any unpleasantness except for what happened in the garden.
0xfdc2d556610f60ace6858df62e18b1fb6ecc3f88 marfa petrovna...” “you have got rid of marfa petrovna, too, so they say?”
0x5d6c778a68922dc53e83c3273f754f64fd5ba71f raskolnikov interrupted rudely.
0xc46b8033e7898e6ceb4c9447e2516be4a78458d7 “oh, you’ve heard that, too, then?
0x783b30839f8d4b0b9fcfe530d7065af3ab3e910a you’d be sure to, though.... but as for your question, i really don’t know what to say, though my own conscience is quite at rest on that score.
0x1575c52d3a3804fe78a22abba9670265b439d3bb don’t suppose that i am in any apprehension about it.
0x54408a73f49341e8e43b3eb8ec62f64539589ee2 all was regular and in order; the medical inquiry diagnosed apoplexy due to bathing immediately after a heavy dinner and a bottle of wine, and indeed it could have proved nothing else.
0xce36e88f90389f91275131156a04c24835dd4638 but i’ll tell you what i have been thinking to myself of late, on my way here in the train, especially: didn’t i contribute to all that... calamity, morally, in a way, by irritation or something of the sort.
0x7109cff391f794ab6bfa02946681e470aea0ed56 but i came to the conclusion that that, too, was quite out of the question.”
0xd0ea4b5c5f135165682c546bca6b725157cff8a1 raskolnikov laughed.
0x4123b321b5855ec5d05e29421399801c5ecfa879 “i wonder you trouble yourself about it!”
0x41ae236c002a97cf468b666b74af7d8f14c58930 “but what are you laughing at?
0x28a2ceac478d0a43d98b1ffecd604cd0fbddc6c2 only consider, i struck her just twice with a switch--there were no marks even... don’t regard me as a cynic, please; i am perfectly aware how atrocious it was of me and all that; but i know for certain, too, that marfa petrovna was very likely pleased at my, so to say, warmth.
0x0b45eec7332dc6ea8146e8813b377d82220efe5b the story of your sister had been wrung out to the last drop; for the last three days marfa petrovna had been forced to sit at home; she had nothing to show herself with in the town.
0x88e4cf8dc41fbedfc74d9c5f62a332fd0749d343 besides, she had bored them so with that letter (you heard about her reading the letter).
0x0c13babeb2345af93f5152e131c7f9bea7d7dc62 and all of a sudden those two switches fell from heaven!
0x66262191b5bed7ca4405dbeca5173669e1325302 her first act was to order the carriage to be got out.... not to speak of the fact that there are cases when women are very, very glad to be insulted in spite of all their show of indignation.
0xf7ec705f5d79140c5c26e9ea45d6974fd7064963 there are instances of it with everyone; human beings in general, indeed, greatly love to be insulted, have you noticed that?
0x879bc02ff8678d1a4ddeff330c811ac8c31886c7 but it’s particularly so with women.
0x46b915d02e8a3d063b7dffb8ba63d086ad98c80d one might even say it’s their only amusement.”
0x677ce49224ff9d6c06b78e7fcd6868bb0d83a6d1 at one time raskolnikov thought of getting up and walking out and so finishing the interview.
0xf37af02d4a344f3a8ba904c177570e0348dfadf4 but some curiosity and even a sort of prudence made him linger for a moment.
0xfa2d695027a307dfee6339eb33024d65ab8afa7a “you are fond of fighting?”
0x7b378fb62c7c1168182fa5ea2da1bbfd42057f22 he asked carelessly.
0xc7675a3b669feb87bfd65d778e7df260abc6f35b “no, not very,” svidrigaïlov answered, calmly.
0x7b07e06574e00a71e7b1f4ae716915aa0217aa10 “and marfa petrovna and i scarcely ever fought.
0xc17988cf88e571930fb373e31eaa7a0341202ec9 we lived very harmoniously, and she was always pleased with me.
0xc488a4d399693a3b6bb01d1a3067496bc6eca463 i only used the whip twice in all our seven years (not counting a third occasion of a very ambiguous character).
0x0a8223eaa39d5b321a94085fb626688c4eddd5b2 the first time, two months after our marriage, immediately after we arrived in the country, and the last time was that of which we are speaking.
0x3bb1cce4b5db000e0b3586a3d3cf576043ccf5cf did you suppose i was such a monster, such a reactionary, such a slave driver?
0xcc31dcabe1b47336ae0fd5de3d0e411918b11dae ha, ha!
0x5b8998d7dd46e15c7151b16e438bb34f21286cfb by the way, do you remember, rodion romanovitch, how a few years ago, in those days of beneficent publicity, a nobleman, i’ve forgotten his name, was put to shame everywhere, in all the papers, for having thrashed a german woman in the railway train.
0x2fbcc33034a8cc931eb1b9f52ea58844c4adf298 you remember?
0xa36cb38b3508987e7babff522b43ff3f50c5eb85 it was in those days, that very year i believe, the ‘disgraceful action of the _age_’ took place (you know, ‘the egyptian nights,’ that public reading, you remember?
0xb02b3483121c87779487f0bb5fc084b11b2740f7 the dark eyes, you know!
0xbfc5f7534ee58dba8dd14aa968751fc03998d7a5 ah, the golden days of our youth, where are they?).
0x02b3fdb81431402d179c5c9c05041999f2713b08 well, as for the gentleman who thrashed the german, i feel no sympathy with him, because after all what need is there for sympathy?
0xfbef82d14e6b6f570aae3d246fca6b81bd05d3b3 but i must say that there are sometimes such provoking ‘germans’ that i don’t believe there is a progressive who could quite answer for himself.
0x98badc05825f74bd941f3a2c13ccba35d7681ea6 no one looked at the subject from that point of view then, but that’s the truly humane point of view, i assure you.”
0x597ef6e7a45c804cd779226ca3b262c717d79a87 after saying this, svidrigaïlov broke into a sudden laugh again.
0x7cc513e81ae4e3d7767130f9c5e047934bcfbcc4 raskolnikov saw clearly that this was a man with a firm purpose in his mind and able to keep it to himself.
0xf752e9cb5e593930b90184ce1fd462f07ab3f955 “i expect you’ve not talked to anyone for some days?”
0xacfbf23c8f7ae5c818fb1cd1580839b4957670ae he asked.
0x86f2a00d26df3c6d7fa3a81b07e3778dd40db83e “scarcely anyone.
0x48fb151f93d6ad21f2a366836a5227ca0b5bad11 i suppose you are wondering at my being such an adaptable man?”
0xaf56d9613ba124260b2be95a4ee8cb9dc2f73fdd “no, i am only wondering at your being too adaptable a man.”
0x20e12d5e53e39ac2bcde65928d215615437733c9 “because i am not offended at the rudeness of your questions?
0xcb1738a118042f3306cfb6b8e525d6e7a58d74a4 is that it?
0x4166360f1f179bfdf578b7a83aa45f6dbb58d626 but why take offence?
0x3fbfb126453eb5cc9ab55c2550302a20df83f031 as you asked, so i answered,” he replied, with a surprising expression of simplicity.
0x58aca5490c82438d46d5a4b23036c9c84701de4b “you know, there’s hardly anything i take interest in,” he went on, as it were dreamily, “especially now, i’ve nothing to do.... you are quite at liberty to imagine though that i am making up to you with a motive, particularly as i told you i want to see your sister about something.
0x4c9e1ae8217da67dd5ae299fab7399ee03b26ad4 but i’ll confess frankly, i am very much bored.
0x0bf78bfc2de35ef386d98b4f2ae975020d5b5fc2 the last three days especially, so i am delighted to see you.... don’t be angry, rodion romanovitch, but you seem to be somehow awfully strange yourself.
0x9a50159262558ba23533247a71cc3dd60bfa53b9 say what you like, there’s something wrong with you, and now, too... not this very minute, i mean, but now, generally.... well, well, i won’t, i won’t, don’t scowl!
0xc5f16a5ef12f21379565296d5269824a22247206 i am not such a bear, you know, as you think.”
0x4c3a8eed1a0fac79980bed451ce84b1363a4c2d3 raskolnikov looked gloomily at him.
0x6bbf73e60f013ef51633add129b5f38a931e6d7c “you are not a bear, perhaps, at all,” he said.
0x46f3c6cc4d5a790dc41dc5d361bca4e90b35b5d5 “i fancy indeed that you are a man of very good breeding, or at least know how on occasion to behave like one.”
0xddff8f7d60d31f53e3aba2f6efec2fe4d5e843c4 “i am not particularly interested in anyone’s opinion,” svidrigaïlov answered, dryly and even with a shade of haughtiness, “and therefore why not be vulgar at times when vulgarity is such a convenient cloak for our climate... and especially if one has a natural propensity that way,” he added, laughing again.
0x80ec466278362d3d3d0a92fb419b92535b99d040 “but i’ve heard you have many friends here.
0x1c9178371d007994665bbdb7e801694f644db26a you are, as they say, ‘not without connections.’
0x0519a383cc53e59fa2c760fe219664064218bb7d what can you want with me, then, unless you’ve some special object?”
0x1dadc7a71f2ff29de18915c50968b99d9c73158f “that’s true that i have friends here,” svidrigaïlov admitted, not replying to the chief point.
0xa0808612dcb330a0861430d85e9f46164fdbfc4a “i’ve met some already.
0x6583e15618c3f301b07342da132dbc0e170c69f9 i’ve been lounging about for the last three days, and i’ve seen them, or they’ve seen me.
0xf319a8009fad57ba4ac075f49e6c753f38cb0739 that’s a matter of course.
0xa2f4b89a47f8e5cc31b2a17d9ca0e5cfa4d73cfd i am well dressed and reckoned not a poor man; the emancipation of the serfs hasn’t affected me; my property consists chiefly of forests and water meadows.
0x9f6ce3904f0a3cf2365f91e54c17cdb4c98ee8cc the revenue has not fallen off; but... i am not going to see them, i was sick of them long ago.
0xcc41b81aaf96890f6fd59eae0cf2eab6f56a18b5 i’ve been here three days and have called on no one.... what a town it is!
0x42392d254f7441f86a68bdaae1664646b57b5f64 how has it come into existence among us, tell me that?
0x06cc41332134a79de16409dd0fd941aeaa03d3e2 a town of officials and students of all sorts.
0xab19bd291e64a7fe6ddab1dd8da3aafcc8b5aa91 yes, there’s a great deal i didn’t notice when i was here eight years ago, kicking up my heels.... my only hope now is in anatomy, by jove, it is!”
0x9a4492631e7271a6948410c8d18aecce47f8345f “anatomy?”
0x0e48d34e39de7bc7b33f6fa93fba4854a1bc8f7d “but as for these clubs, dussauts, parades, or progress, indeed, maybe--well, all that can go on without me,” he went on, again without noticing the question.
0x799b04a715876908e28d4a6da214be40ab926873 “besides, who wants to be a card-sharper?”
0xa27b90fded7faabe17d650f1da443b9b0ed354ab “why, have you been a card-sharper then?”
0x2ac74ebd7eca797e99a97dc506497287d478ac03 “how could i help being?
0x8ac72d6f8288e041eecc0862d9fa20c71bfec1d9 there was a regular set of us, men of the best society, eight years ago; we had a fine time.
0x657fbd9d3525d5a73528315fba916bcd2a721fa6 and all men of breeding, you know, poets, men of property.
0x3f3c82410ab0eb61f4e50fce38f3878944973b4d and indeed as a rule in our russian society the best manners are found among those who’ve been thrashed, have you noticed that?
0xe3cb0b88b7a7bd0b8e62ff60e5c3bd2d71702e35 i’ve deteriorated in the country.
0x432b66f823459baa95c838ba4adc303d4b003873 but i did get into prison for debt, through a low greek who came from nezhin.
0x40863997f350f29c5808fa7fdc061e6c9de96e75 then marfa petrovna turned up; she bargained with him and bought me off for thirty thousand silver pieces (i owed seventy thousand).
0xb7763a5037683d3c96b3e70865600e94f76ce680 we were united in lawful wedlock and she bore me off into the country like a treasure.
0x7245e8d7ea9c93c3cef52f933cb47c51a3baba25 you know she was five years older than i. she was very fond of me.
0xd5626f363f17ef12b97102e67878955f380d066e for seven years i never left the country.
0xd09da0223d615e8c8c385bb5881d4ceddc3dc3f5 and, take note, that all my life she held a document over me, the iou for thirty thousand roubles, so if i were to elect to be restive about anything i should be trapped at once!
0x812546b521915bf98f6f4890aee3d774b32b8c85 and she would have done it!
0xea433492091df6a96b64f1468da7f30f517fda4b women find nothing incompatible in that.”
0x891abf0355992f0c733a74aff318c79d7cc8669f “if it hadn’t been for that, would you have given her the slip?”
0xb37c2abe09995236caaeefeebf091eeab4f5bba7 “i don’t know what to say.
0x917a4417880a9b34aa8db839dcecb51bf8748f22 it was scarcely the document restrained me.
0x1528c0fabcec4ccf3e2864b9b6f83718d6fa70e4 i didn’t want to go anywhere else.
0x54367268603e10c49c9c4ccf5855ffb65705647e marfa petrovna herself invited me to go abroad, seeing i was bored, but i’ve been abroad before, and always felt sick there.
0x465c0d7d38e9f661f97e4ba45b137133075dd27e for no reason, but the sunrise, the bay of naples, the sea--you look at them and it makes you sad.
0xcc02f3246ca43ee48b85e73a4c54fe29e8d45bce what’s most revolting is that one is really sad!
0xd28b706be633ede98cbc4bfd73f53ef5fada74d1 no, it’s better at home.
0xd249581ff62759dc05a8953f2fc72b0f0745a898 here at least one blames others for everything and excuses oneself.
0x32bbedcd93f31080166372d22662fa58379798ae i should have gone perhaps on an expedition to the north pole, because _j’ai le vin mauvais_ and hate drinking, and there’s nothing left but wine.
0x3e0e944fba2abaf99ccbc0acbd1e65a5a2dda83f i have tried it.
0x5d1d3dd31cdeaa2ce34476a835e9d66cba15aca8 but, i say, i’ve been told berg is going up in a great balloon next sunday from the yusupov garden and will take up passengers at a fee.
0xbffa7ac6efea8d2c9aa75efb48fcbf1e2c8d6905 is it true?”
0x3d080b4cb828431b4d083338b6a487b2ed6dee78 “why, would you go up?”
0xe12ed0d86b793a0bfc2092f161e4a615ec412c19 “i... no, oh, no,” muttered svidrigaïlov really seeming to be deep in thought.
0xdf2c1d005bdfb2bbd8b89980d64f960d1ba9f028 “what does he mean?
0x6537fdfb6de7c6734503768f53c52d6e1242bab1 is he in earnest?”
0x18eb26c4966ce94ee043c05d0a4ead2c84d8f37d raskolnikov wondered.
0x1065d7c533270597ea2aa8b8cb501e9f742f24b9 “no, the document didn’t restrain me,” svidrigaïlov went on, meditatively.
0xcfde7dde5b2953229b5a3ea407db83c3014af0f5 “it was my own doing, not leaving the country, and nearly a year ago marfa petrovna gave me back the document on my name-day and made me a present of a considerable sum of money, too.
0x9b46e97cf1564c7d77e2ed655c2d54a7b746d552 she had a fortune, you know.
0xed5f3cd07f9e266ad036b73fb2db0af53c9676c5 ‘you see how i trust you, arkady ivanovitch’--that was actually her expression.

0x03cb06a6208bf2a58af6cf71537ae95a74c469f4 but do you know i managed the estate quite decently, they know me in the neighbourhood.
0x25c35dba42ed8bd69e980170a06d1f7965305d86 i ordered books, too.
0x5c555cba9e31f8ed3a93b41ba882fd69d4f960cc marfa petrovna at first approved, but afterwards she was afraid of my over-studying.”
0xb58128c7e74cf9d16e92a9d2c9a2676daf2c3d24 “you seem to be missing marfa petrovna very much?”
0x4007821c204995520feef78e16b52949bf5e736a “missing her?
0x6fc1cf407fe8aecb7c6cee9472bec0aa21b5a930 perhaps.
0xda1695486cb9b76d23efe7bf132b4d42d618031e really, perhaps i am.
0xdb9368b5712cf0e3c5887315a3359a31e84cf39e and, by the way, do you believe in ghosts?”

0x2275a102638c66c525c911032aa443f762989bed “why, ordinary ghosts.”

0x0eef7082bb4e73d97fb5dac63d86347bf192ae17 svidrigaïlov looked at him rather oddly.
0xb229dc742b8b4d37e15b84255025168d75171fe1 “marfa petrovna is pleased to visit me,” he said, twisting his mouth into a strange smile.

0xf25a8d419ae638905ab305a6bd156a069570c79a at the same moment he was surprised at having said it.
0xca295b78b36f1557f2cb1ac5008c013f8c4659b9 he was much excited.
0xe5223fdb02d9ee9ecf8a04f7116dd98e3afde8a1 “what!
0x46a14989c545953313a59f35f91f01da8dd62487 did you think so?”
0xa7559adc850e48839ba55aeff580c1f0211b951a svidrigaïlov asked in astonishment.
0xd7cb5cd3762cbe7331ce8d89a8299ff35a314495 “did you really?
0xfc14e8e64f2407500c72f51d9769fac18808253a didn’t i say that there was something in common between us, eh?”
0x3698a3e8adee6a3f627d2916bbf667ed40548377 “you never said so!”
0x068ed30f0ed46ccfc01a361bd2cb2104b8d9cb04 raskolnikov cried sharply and with heat.
0x881db4d83493ac56dfa5bbe7e32bd802aaf02f22 “didn’t i?”
0x32ce54f56b31b99cecad1f8c6aef54fb2300a200 “no!”
0x7bf9d79a74072af3ebb7675c7cce3ed1b2398b30 “i thought i did.
0xa28d3429fcfda6c9065ad8eec0509db5c7dc0e5a when i came in and saw you lying with your eyes shut, pretending, i said to myself at once, ‘here’s the man.’” “what do you mean by ‘the man?’
0x55fc0bc3693906c9b0dd259f3545a8ecb941c652 what are you talking about?”
0x7b8b6091ba58f4640a164803487c404180d15f9d cried raskolnikov.
0x317bb8350295f340892c1bf60a205721868cb572 “what do i mean?
0x8b065ef0408d85ec942012104b4ba0c6c111d873 i really don’t know....” svidrigaïlov muttered ingenuously, as though he, too, were puzzled.
0x05046cbfe6ac9091f1e66bfbc4926f702d5b70ab for a minute they were silent.
0x84d16701fcf71e9f242efb66a65360771302f67e they stared in each other’s faces.
0x558d3e982ae01c6055eb941de89b4631781179de “that’s all nonsense!”
0xe27b2b8dce340761fa34289375eaf2e7dde2f4a0 raskolnikov shouted with vexation.
0x909e2804029de284a22537130b257412fa43b6e8 “what does she say when she comes to you?”
0x415c31f6010eb1eb35db4e49f01fa07f48aa1f3e “she!
0x865c5c77aee4e702129ddd924e20633eacf6f3bd would you believe it, she talks of the silliest trifles and--man is a strange creature--it makes me angry.
0x20775485e5a3b4ae46bccc735362fd8b98e2d0d5 the first time she came in (i was tired you know: the funeral service, the funeral ceremony, the lunch afterwards.
0x1c1e2478c47665191c67106cff9711b9f878bcea at last i was left alone in my study.
0xb6dbaec4f1d6f900d5f6240edffd413a9deb2bb9 i lighted a cigar and began to think), she came in at the door.
0x2effbdf7b109a556048daa83308d885a947ad4e9 ‘you’ve been so busy to-day, arkady ivanovitch, you have forgotten to wind the dining-room clock,’ she said.
0x9f3e5904bd67bf10c110b6e5a4bbc11611de497c all those seven years i’ve wound that clock every week, and if i forgot it she would always remind me.
0x1c250b6cd916626d8f1c05120771f2c8210e1bda the next day i set off on my way here.
0x8ae35f0e0b8cce6c41f24694c9a2c3002c26d1c8 i got out at the station at daybreak; i’d been asleep, tired out, with my eyes half open, i was drinking some coffee.
0x10544576567682b14a1ff1de99993c2c036e3b66 i looked up and there was suddenly marfa petrovna sitting beside me with a pack of cards in her hands.
0xd6e94885df2ef33e2245366242db8bb6a3a6ddde ‘shall i tell your fortune for the journey, arkady ivanovitch?’
0xffacf402624074c1a3f133ee4f646296b311772f she was a great hand at telling fortunes.
0x707e9966fa901a6622d2b228a09b5b4d3e3614a9 i shall never forgive myself for not asking her to.
0x5a7c64df05108a9f9088ec72c012d72708222452 i ran away in a fright, and, besides, the bell rang.
0x488394fcc62fbc3f4db52846030840bf4f2c7c00 i was sitting to-day, feeling very heavy after a miserable dinner from a cookshop; i was sitting smoking, all of a sudden marfa petrovna again.
0xf13634b1f6f2858ead8896ca0348622ab4fd6d7d she came in very smart in a new green silk dress with a long train.
0x3ce5307c03dadee2942a541fb271e0c7fa548717 ‘good day, arkady ivanovitch!
0x07b11a75f46f5a02996810cfa43a3b40cf0ad2b8 how do you like my dress?
0xed18ed6f785bcff1ab3b556d4d9fb3c5c706e7ce aniska can’t make like this.’
0x9f9016d495901c1c008ff867f805e5d4c288bd07 (aniska was a dressmaker in the country, one of our former serf girls who had been trained in moscow, a pretty wench.)
0x0affb8c0ba89c4f1c22aefa8c0f5032f41d243db she stood turning round before me.
0x5f3f5d4ab7dfe8815b873f2e558f5bb338552928 i looked at the dress, and then i looked carefully, very carefully, at her face.
0x5ef132d5c5ebcdb3f03c00a608b52c542a7c7c83 ‘i wonder you trouble to come to me about such trifles, marfa petrovna.’
0x52fb84914e2c25b3ea5ddb05625d9cedcf03b3c5 ‘good gracious, you won’t let one disturb you about anything!’
0x83b3a6b01347fb79e904b6383a130b2240781d14 to tease her i said, ‘i want to get married, marfa petrovna.’
0x66baaf810dbaaf5cf7166a59ebf7c34ba81be22d ‘that’s just like you, arkady ivanovitch; it does you very little credit to come looking for a bride when you’ve hardly buried your wife.
0x0ce6183d07577b4b8ecbed5105c4eca2676d85bd and if you could make a good choice, at least, but i know it won’t be for your happiness or hers, you will only be a laughing-stock to all good people.’
0xec72848e7ca87a220b05107434d3752bc1d90c01 then she went out and her train seemed to rustle.
0x7b698ee216599a33dcfe96779761b5ebe2d6f92b isn’t it nonsense, eh?”
0xb6b4fc9e98c0e34fe30586a9b30bdd172243680e “but perhaps you are telling lies?”
0x6fd4025a36c812293385ea7d65a891e8ecd6256a raskolnikov put in.
0x499804fe2c0124490a4d7c13e19893469c04b22f “i rarely lie,” answered svidrigaïlov thoughtfully, apparently not noticing the rudeness of the question.
0x1fa091c7505bb42562b490e1ec04370782113908 “and in the past, have you ever seen ghosts before?”
0x3f8eb7e6136a72070112dd2e5a92b08f020192f6 “y-yes, i have seen them, but only once in my life, six years ago.
0x5ef2871046cb2889c8942c14395e222410675ce6 i had a serf, filka; just after his burial i called out forgetting ‘filka, my pipe!’
0xf0d2c7c1daa84dba033a1004d3bcb22cf6a950d5 he came in and went to the cupboard where my pipes were.
0xb921c4f4ba2ecfaaf11bae34f58a426f9eaa461d i sat still and thought ‘he is doing it out of revenge,’ because we had a violent quarrel just before his death.
0x5d57aac50d802acaf7f22af666d01115dd4b4d54 ‘how dare you come in with a hole in your elbow?’
0xd74c54feabaf29cd7a1879f37c529affd501afa0 i said.
0x926b3f1d0dffef304c0ddb55aa4d538aebaccd0b ‘go away, you scamp!’
0x415753521a12987d15553134aa325ae9bb02ccff he turned and went out, and never came again.
0x4de9fac8a4baac1a8cc01b6a84282253b7d5ff59 i didn’t tell marfa petrovna at the time.
0x9a9a4218411c492dadbb0121c415d89f2a311311 i wanted to have a service sung for him, but i was ashamed.”
0xfbf29fa113801a75db9eab6437ff2fb80c5b5266 “you should go to a doctor.”
0x897d280700b6345496b625c67a683c6aa9680e84 “i know i am not well, without your telling me, though i don’t know what’s wrong; i believe i am five times as strong as you are.
0xd79ec7aed5d9fa4c5eb5de14ca1313da4b33217f i didn’t ask you whether you believe that ghosts are seen, but whether you believe that they exist.”
0x8a60330b6bdaeb0d4f4fdc5d2bd3dc6ba8de6375 “no, i won’t believe it!”
0x18db386ecf86d595a0cbbf5708628cba83904fdd raskolnikov cried, with positive anger.
0xea4e76aa756c867bf34c47ec8a18b8c40aab6b56 “what do people generally say?”
0x3cf49331d0cf224580b153d15fd6bcf6a212f989 muttered svidrigaïlov, as though speaking to himself, looking aside and bowing his head.
0x4505ce7557d2ba4e24afbf319b0626c1b2875c28 “they say, ‘you are ill, so what appears to you is only unreal fantasy.’
0xc9e435dffe67a9b776be90fe89659a13d9879133 but that’s not strictly logical.
0x6bcef815fb20936c2f4ad6f0c88b3c4eff92fbe6 i agree that ghosts only appear to the sick, but that only proves that they are unable to appear except to the sick, not that they don’t exist.”
0xd42a121eb49161c2977d5dc86ed02c683e12537c “nothing of the sort,” raskolnikov insisted irritably.
0x082f1b7ffc35b52bd0b6ad8e63e0f992d2715a5d “no?
0xf52b14b5b4a68c5fb1d837afecadcccf87e79914 you don’t think so?”
0xa0bb9fbbfe2a7cc6d3f031f3d31d81283742cd9d svidrigaïlov went on, looking at him deliberately.
0x215d995ca5a2e9284e612d5d59a037552d9adf47 “but what do you say to this argument (help me with it): ghosts are, as it were, shreds and fragments of other worlds, the beginning of them.
0x3d2cd35313cafc9c59cc70a8708a2a46eb147a71 a man in health has, of course, no reason to see them, because he is above all a man of this earth and is bound for the sake of completeness and order to live only in this life.
0xae2ec4fd9534f548ba4380af52ee05e5a3e05d60 but as soon as one is ill, as soon as the normal earthly order of the organism is broken, one begins to realise the possibility of another world; and the more seriously ill one is, the closer becomes one’s contact with that other world, so that as soon as the man dies he steps straight into that world.
0x0cf79c0198b0b1810834d113a5385d81fb90c2f6 i thought of that long ago.
0x0c7dd7d8b27f2ed762c0e68deebe59e0350b6ae2 if you believe in a future life, you could believe in that, too.”
0x33cc1f76d92bb84215118ec7eb58587595e091a2 “i don’t believe in a future life,” said raskolnikov.
0x61485fc516ea3f978f2f03db2f020f883c620cf8 svidrigaïlov sat lost in thought.
0x4c461c5072c4c9671c7e5d17cd66339979efc005 “and what if there are only spiders there, or something of that sort,” he said suddenly.
0xeb40ee2beb52ff55b6d345e20e35d8000a028f34 “he is a madman,” thought raskolnikov.
0x18f822a84e4f5379c5075158cdb97de4aa5bbeea “we always imagine eternity as something beyond our conception, something vast, vast!
0x733b3e69e3a9ac7f982e9685fbec67b1d97aac1d but why must it be vast?
0x48441da07d0a189793a8f6199e45bf5342ed0f0a instead of all that, what if it’s one little room, like a bath house in the country, black and grimy and spiders in every corner, and that’s all eternity is?
0x9f4400ce83e0d27575280b68b016ecc3e395cd78 i sometimes fancy it like that.”
0xc172c6c19619052d8e5a2c7ac1d95eeb961d4289 “can it be you can imagine nothing juster and more comforting than that?”
0x61a7359393bc8a39c3da8619fe1f683feacfe1a4 raskolnikov cried, with a feeling of anguish.
0x4352477908efcc7be599c3bfdd8acf330c4e1cd9 “juster?
0x5b44e8e0fd25bd00645d7a709002f539425e8bff and how can we tell, perhaps that is just, and do you know it’s what i would certainly have made it,” answered svidrigaïlov, with a vague smile.
0x4c47004faf974df4abc89af6ed04055d46e30984 this horrible answer sent a cold chill through raskolnikov.
0x12e384a2ea61b813d7c8bd90bb7238993bf87256 svidrigaïlov raised his head, looked at him, and suddenly began laughing.
0x33ada97918874f95967a7389d274b5ae809fd62c “only think,” he cried, “half an hour ago we had never seen each other, we regarded each other as enemies; there is a matter unsettled between us; we’ve thrown it aside, and away we’ve gone into the abstract!
0xf497cb5d1b52a4b7ad63893e2056412e63db67f8 wasn’t i right in saying that we were birds of a feather?”
0x9f5309aa4d5b5cfd6f6389e8b1f37ec1590f86da “kindly allow me,” raskolnikov went on irritably, “to ask you to explain why you have honoured me with your visit... and... and i am in a hurry, i have no time to waste.
0x72dc71cf76cebcd739ee29857099f11cad435706 i want to go out.”
0x7d2085382ae30719e93c3ecd7518ef963602f670 “by all means, by all means.

0x939b8608a684ab3e3d93c1d06a64167928f570ab “can you refrain from any question about my sister and from mentioning her name?
0x42bf07230cf84bd8e34dfda7d4a40bbfc8aa9601 i can’t understand how you dare utter her name in my presence, if you really are svidrigaïlov.”
0xd568c21733cd5757eae66051a4908d928d5d5708 “why, but i’ve come here to speak about her; how can i avoid mentioning her?”
0x1eb4012b91707ecec1860d85c35b4477663bcf85 “very good, speak, but make haste.”
0x921a7d0417fc4d35e5583d9bfa702b497794606a “i am sure that you must have formed your own opinion of this mr. luzhin, who is a connection of mine through my wife, if you have only seen him for half an hour, or heard any facts about him.
0xede053c8b5ceae38a207cbf8f11733ee4f12a8b8 he is no match for avdotya romanovna.
0x5f59016f9d693467f267775bf3d3d028b1b069af i believe avdotya romanovna is sacrificing herself generously and imprudently for the sake of... for the sake of her family.

0x3b1c7db94be49c37abfbc0dd42481edaef45fc56 “all this is very naïve... excuse me, i should have said impudent on your part,” said raskolnikov.
0xc29b03f7ecf2b31225188ace05680dc79b09dcef “you mean to say that i am seeking my own ends.

0x618d600522aee5e98b26dded616b6c774954f67e i will confess something psychologically curious about that: just now, defending my love for avdotya romanovna, i said i was myself the victim.

0x0106d6a522460ca16180aa843bc3073f0dcc0c9d “i certainly am idle and depraved, but your sister has such qualities that even i could not help being impressed by them.

0x8281dd566ce686a2c7c7b424d9ca7a375eb63dc9 if avdotya romanovna does not accept it, i shall waste it in some more foolish way.
0xdd2932ab666fb6951f7cba17682eecaad3019df0 that’s the first thing.
0x35bde5a472822a7458ce8d07cdcc84e7a0f78e26 secondly, my conscience is perfectly easy; i make the offer with no ulterior motive.
0xb591b0e167fc598d2a69c77ecb4d6c01cc69d18f you may not believe it, but in the end avdotya romanovna and you will know.
0xaef1958a9b28cff372dcb69edb518c3c969bf911 the point is, that i did actually cause your sister, whom i greatly respect, some trouble and unpleasantness, and so, sincerely regretting it, i want--not to compensate, not to repay her for the unpleasantness, but simply to do something to her advantage, to show that i am not, after all, privileged to do nothing but harm.
0x3b5bdea2877bce224399e699465a09adf2d0fb06 if there were a millionth fraction of self-interest in my offer, i should not have made it so openly; and i should not have offered her ten thousand only, when five weeks ago i offered her more, besides, i may, perhaps, very soon marry a young lady, and that alone ought to prevent suspicion of any design on avdotya romanovna.
0xfb23d766b96e6b928fc0b9ac341003ea2e66067f in conclusion, let me say that in marrying mr. luzhin, she is taking money just the same, only from another man.
0x0dc8a81457f8377783bf52c29d2573116e09782f don’t be angry, rodion romanovitch, think it over coolly and quietly.”
0xd83488cea9ec1c1f3362bc34c97dd3122aecc9b0 svidrigaïlov himself was exceedingly cool and quiet as he was saying this.

0x8de4c095ebdabcf0613ac7b2b140e42224c0fe5e that’s absurd.

0x4b513a9e3635aa57b23307e2dd5a3569a92fb3cd asked razumihin, as soon as they were in the street.

0xf514bf734a559c387176192ccdc6e7073d5ee013 “yes, i remember him perfectly, i should know him in a thousand; i have a good memory for faces.”
0x9fd02899914656cef96b849ba4cb7cc4581a77d8 they were silent again.
0x81b61c11d11dbd5e34cbc40fbd4dfa850280c5f5 “hm!... that’s all right,” muttered raskolnikov.
0xe1ff442e0774e0c216f3f6f8514253240bb362e2 “do you know, i fancied... i keep thinking that it may have been an hallucination.”

0x9eea4d3a5429f98da2e93d8ef08089e66489e26c raskolnikov did not answer.
0x702620a908c6cd1b61799fdefbd21cee5c767948 razumihin thought a minute.
0x6ac87ddcc5f09e972bdde8aeb761562ae721ecae “now let me tell you my story,” he began, “i came to you, you were asleep.
0x7e360612fd47d531261be82bbaceaf36a013ffa3 then we had dinner and then i went to porfiry’s, zametov was still with him.

0x1c0ba1f54e34de6a6399a831070af3b6783d3243 they don’t seem to understand and can’t understand, but are not a bit ashamed.
0x64658b9eee89c2eccf929463400ce543a106c6bd i drew porfiry to the window, and began talking to him, but it was still no use.
0x3e50e3f493ef139876c69ed05dfaf56233d06ab1 he looked away and i looked away.
0xb94d004889be4b5a799cfbd70c9669fe4540def9 at last i shook my fist in his ugly face, and told him as a cousin i’d brain him.
0x32ce97e036b5ceb6207686ec663deaec32e99cd0 he merely looked at me, i cursed and came away.
0x41b2ac836ab4914dea71c97e3d632675f55c512e that was all.
0xc79a50174673d9446a61d89535765ba678ba5240 it was very stupid.
0x290651ec3fc8127d77d88283748fd62e028b60df to zametov i didn’t say a word.
0x905c3e6c495d708b668c59bb25854507203e8cd9 but, you see, i thought i’d made a mess of it, but as i went downstairs a brilliant idea struck me: why should we trouble?
0x80526c16c900814cd875a21c4acf0c592c6bdb22 of course if you were in any danger or anything, but why need you care?
0xb6cd198c74367ace7d1b0d914a2ccb1a4d6fa3b0 you needn’t care a hang for them.

0xa114d8252e1ab2125c787d49daa59ec29da24b1a “to be sure,” answered raskolnikov.
0xb132c9d8d1836608148c469e24793368ca67c90d “but what will you say to-morrow?”
0xa3718116e08d6cce7c24113e785d687422bf7f42 he thought to himself.
0x629233c3cf56c7c4112a0e1ddca045e9a652f248 strange to say, till that moment it had never occurred to him to wonder what razumihin would think when he knew.
0x5a6985a2abd35d756099bf43338b84717064ee35 as he thought it, raskolnikov looked at him.
0xf5c004e619fd182a1c94138dcd6694163ff54665 razumihin’s account of his visit to porfiry had very little interest for him, so much had come and gone since then.
0x38a3cc9ce904b00296b8323103855bba30084971 in the corridor they came upon luzhin; he had arrived punctually at eight, and was looking for the number, so that all three went in together without greeting or looking at one another.
0x8324ba153a3c2f8ae16260ef99c8dcdd1c948cfb the young men walked in first, while pyotr petrovitch, for good manners, lingered a little in the passage, taking off his coat.
0x21586837a0c569c21fc53a6c4a5eb2cc76726d5d pulcheria alexandrovna came forward at once to greet him in the doorway, dounia was welcoming her brother.
0xf2946cbc4fd532d1e56971af5c37b373309e0adb pyotr petrovitch walked in and quite amiably, though with redoubled dignity, bowed to the ladies.
0xa461657bb8d129257b5fe51299bf1a3d55a118ce he looked, however, as though he were a little put out and could not yet recover himself.
0x056a4635dc4df7d8766f5878d004ecea7d18c265 pulcheria alexandrovna, who seemed also a little embarrassed, hastened to make them all sit down at the round table where a samovar was boiling.
0xd2c8cefb96af61ad49ade8797a2b943f4fddfda5 dounia and luzhin were facing one another on opposite sides of the table.
0x44e46ce286bea39ffe19471a5818896322751f08 razumihin and raskolnikov were facing pulcheria alexandrovna, razumihin was next to luzhin and raskolnikov was beside his sister.
0x51b25e80300be9c77db0379959779cb0c1638ca9 a moment’s silence followed.
0x391c06af2712449b14dabac08f2d889f1a9ecd6f pyotr petrovitch deliberately drew out a cambric handkerchief reeking of scent and blew his nose with an air of a benevolent man who felt himself slighted, and was firmly resolved to insist on an explanation.
0xa1ad92a577bdb3bbcbf8bbdf5c72049fa9b702d1 in the passage the idea had occurred to him to keep on his overcoat and walk away, and so give the two ladies a sharp and emphatic lesson and make them feel the gravity of the position.
0x09dc6f7f35c4093c04d17d224c765c907b38affc but he could not bring himself to do this.
0x9bb33e2c2ce141d490ba08613419a9b7eae52dbd besides, he could not endure uncertainty, and he wanted an explanation: if his request had been so openly disobeyed, there was something behind it, and in that case it was better to find it out beforehand; it rested with him to punish them and there would always be time for that.
0xdea3aff7acdd2f3d0a2366c47da1da819539fe8f “i trust you had a favourable journey,” he inquired officially of pulcheria alexandrovna.
0x44dafb5c1d6a1243580f6b89d2d5f235725ad017 “oh, very, pyotr petrovitch.”
0x071c6ccb2c4a3f48ada6b60993b6bd66c33892d2 “i am gratified to hear it.
0xb8e3b1fd4ec102d134735a5e8ea11784f4cf8bed and avdotya romanovna is not over-fatigued either?”
0xc0af8633683082c97feb5e140f11c8f5bc721c04 “i am young and strong, i don’t get tired, but it was a great strain for mother,” answered dounia.
0xb3d87e23e819f6f218bd9041885229a0337dad00 “that’s unavoidable!
0x4f5e5626bbca593a595ac10d9f52d28fe2211f83 our national railways are of terrible length.
0x4b3cfe25ad425b612ec6a61752f81e94b952ea1c ‘mother russia,’ as they say, is a vast country.... in spite of all my desire to do so, i was unable to meet you yesterday.
0x384f71955860f6d95cb2b59a7a9680ca4860c467 but i trust all passed off without inconvenience?”
0x266f68ea83b641998f3b2d4c890bc84e1f4caff8 “oh, no, pyotr petrovitch, it was all terribly disheartening,” pulcheria alexandrovna hastened to declare with peculiar intonation, “and if dmitri prokofitch had not been sent us, i really believe by god himself, we should have been utterly lost.
0xf4405a5528aa474b0c754edf172dffa952176784 here, he is!
0xf580170be058064989195fd022b1366a2acf2cef dmitri prokofitch razumihin,” she added, introducing him to luzhin.
0x99a13e2e4569e0b254142b730f4d60d34e44a2c9 “i had the pleasure... yesterday,” muttered pyotr petrovitch with a hostile glance sidelong at razumihin; then he scowled and was silent.
0x03c38fd4a7ea05091e53f69c9992b37104f0b69e pyotr petrovitch belonged to that class of persons, on the surface very polite in society, who make a great point of punctiliousness, but who, directly they are crossed in anything, are completely disconcerted, and become more like sacks of flour than elegant and lively men of society.
0xcf792c5ed507cb623aef9607efa1f76df64c18f6 again all was silent; raskolnikov was obstinately mute, avdotya romanovna was unwilling to open the conversation too soon.
0x0b9a50388da3bf23b5e9e969cc5c1a776d3a567b razumihin had nothing to say, so pulcheria alexandrovna was anxious again.
0x049580cf489b384068e9a3e6a5b020bd3f746495 “marfa petrovna is dead, have you heard?”
0xf97db9d01d8930d8ca3a3dc8f7cf87e3faffc4a4 she began having recourse to her leading item of conversation.
0x332bfe49cf268a4ba944fe5241a0f35d98bdc031 “to be sure, i heard so.
0x898ffd4f0a70fb042bf19fbc1866c4f2cacfbd7e i was immediately informed, and i have come to make you acquainted with the fact that arkady ivanovitch svidrigaïlov set off in haste for petersburg immediately after his wife’s funeral.
0xffa1fe17b03c5988caf39695d88076904d65ec5e so at least i have excellent authority for believing.”
0x7f1dc14b33390d3f2a8cd18e6b8066eb0479b8b1 “to petersburg?
0xcf6a857cef373ffaa182169fb26e9bf61c079971 here?”
0x445e2079b3ffb1db433bb2045d800100704fff52 dounia asked in alarm and looked at her mother.
0x2eb20ef34e2fbbdbefc62e2c8bd669f1ab081e76 “yes, indeed, and doubtless not without some design, having in view the rapidity of his departure, and all the circumstances preceding it.”
0x30b4b680a4068d82e915c51a0631bf04e40c8078 “good heavens!
0xb3e101ef950321f2f90ec888bf419561edb3eb3f won’t he leave dounia in peace even here?”
0xfe21f45cad12407fc9e8dd89dfa8187a4d31cb4f cried pulcheria alexandrovna.
0x77959cf22b07ce6aeec5921ea360b6e3f346091e “i imagine that neither you nor avdotya romanovna have any grounds for uneasiness, unless, of course, you are yourselves desirous of getting into communication with him.
0x83ffd3d94b00915acf6791482ff5bb1b03855c9c for my part i am on my guard, and am now discovering where he is lodging.”
0x4d75245a89c73c5602615764797075a8ea28bf9d “oh, pyotr petrovitch, you would not believe what a fright you have given me,” pulcheria alexandrovna went on: “i’ve only seen him twice, but i thought him terrible, terrible!
0x0d2ffb83ab6621de70074fc7917366d1c0ce3d97 i am convinced that he was the cause of marfa petrovna’s death.”
0x38fbd36a86605e646adf52e1c23534cad4929882 “it’s impossible to be certain about that.
0x2715de475c43308a5017260ec4fb3b65b57f5d7d i have precise information.
0x34f299d5f47d6c250540f610c863140eaba606e7 i do not dispute that he may have contributed to accelerate the course of events by the moral influence, so to say, of the affront; but as to the general conduct and moral characteristics of that personage, i am in agreement with you.
0x20ebee41d42e2765e1e5e97925b2bfe8d673577e i do not know whether he is well off now, and precisely what marfa petrovna left him; this will be known to me within a very short period; but no doubt here in petersburg, if he has any pecuniary resources, he will relapse at once into his old ways.
0x00ea5d9a4e811c6199f8391a1751150edf669257 he is the most depraved, and abjectly vicious specimen of that class of men.
0x9ad6972a4ff7d899a2bdad4179099e78ede5cb0e i have considerable reason to believe that marfa petrovna, who was so unfortunate as to fall in love with him and to pay his debts eight years ago, was of service to him also in another way.
0xb57eb5c01fcc141400d9d3501396257f445a3995 solely by her exertions and sacrifices, a criminal charge, involving an element of fantastic and homicidal brutality for which he might well have been sentenced to siberia, was hushed up.
0x3c60657248fbf0ba5d198da015a78648863d577f that’s the sort of man he is, if you care to know.”
0x8b92542ba8d8fcb55a78493b250be2e55ce868b8 “good heavens!”
0xfe21f45cad12407fc9e8dd89dfa8187a4d31cb4f cried pulcheria alexandrovna.
0xf8c29c4ea6bdc3026a6a676d001dc0f658c7f8b4 raskolnikov listened attentively.
0x064384146ddcbf8f1caff6c5fe3f8a1fb72ddc2c “are you speaking the truth when you say that you have good evidence of this?”
0x30fb2e51a9ab5f2c363880d11bc0228527591b9a dounia asked sternly and emphatically.
0xee4193cac4a934189653f86998acc68eb4a1c347 “i only repeat what i was told in secret by marfa petrovna.
0xdfcb19cf4a3bd374d2ab1d044d3663baa9147f91 i must observe that from the legal point of view the case was far from clear.
0x8b192f3df587f8c85d7b7c8dbc8ea7e74f441aca there was, and i believe still is, living here a woman called resslich, a foreigner, who lent small sums of money at interest, and did other commissions, and with this woman svidrigaïlov had for a long while close and mysterious relations.
0x5b2e98df13f1a86809c41c4dc83df339e3b79762 she had a relation, a niece i believe, living with her, a deaf and dumb girl of fifteen, or perhaps not more than fourteen.
0x60a701bbb86ac64a355c7088641f45964bb1ae29 resslich hated this girl, and grudged her every crust; she used to beat her mercilessly.
0x58c649413341b312c9dac7d4b3b0d319c5aa2456 one day the girl was found hanging in the garret.
0xbcf4f409bbc2fc06058e171eac833653e555a024 at the inquest the verdict was suicide.
0x3a0da81a5f4521d6ed3d10be19a62b17772e4949 after the usual proceedings the matter ended, but, later on, information was given that the child had been... cruelly outraged by svidrigaïlov.
0xc47749b2e25fe6a4582f68b29df35701afbffec8 it is true, this was not clearly established, the information was given by another german woman of loose character whose word could not be trusted; no statement was actually made to the police, thanks to marfa petrovna’s money and exertions; it did not get beyond gossip.
0xff3bcf418e50d0859c729a1f48f238930b2aed10 and yet the story is a very significant one.
0x2ef28fbddd6293eb3385ef0101b0ed8876e048a2 you heard, no doubt, avdotya romanovna, when you were with them the story of the servant philip who died of ill treatment he received six years ago, before the abolition of serfdom.”
0x992b74b09ded28575505be0b12c444eb8d70b4da “i heard, on the contrary, that this philip hanged himself.”
0x19992d3b69094005948b3e98b9f5886a635662dd “quite so, but what drove him, or rather perhaps disposed him, to suicide was the systematic persecution and severity of mr. svidrigaïlov.”
0x1a05b2b1743ba7e2fa8964ad94bef5c6e3bd0abf “i don’t know that,” answered dounia, dryly.
0xc0ddc5c630221dd921db694800caa7e74b077e4a “i only heard a queer story that philip was a sort of hypochondriac, a sort of domestic philosopher, the servants used to say, ‘he read himself silly,’ and that he hanged himself partly on account of mr. svidrigaïlov’s mockery of him and not his blows.
0xe18e210c47029ff9f8485a612a28f2b8d30d3b00 when i was there he behaved well to the servants, and they were actually fond of him, though they certainly did blame him for philip’s death.”
0x813e5f003dad1fa657e0410f934bfd420a5a1777 “i perceive, avdotya romanovna, that you seem disposed to undertake his defence all of a sudden,” luzhin observed, twisting his lips into an ambiguous smile, “there’s no doubt that he is an astute man, and insinuating where ladies are concerned, of which marfa petrovna, who has died so strangely, is a terrible instance.
0x85c5c089b42573040b7a4854779352422131fb53 my only desire has been to be of service to you and your mother with my advice, in view of the renewed efforts which may certainly be anticipated from him.
0xed4b74427ffc823afe0b4815c8a728f0d6ef0e6c for my part it’s my firm conviction, that he will end in a debtor’s prison again.
0x171f0fb627210565fda4f4ac69d4895d1e2b4bee marfa petrovna had not the slightest intention of settling anything substantial on him, having regard for his children’s interests, and, if she left him anything, it would only be the merest sufficiency, something insignificant and ephemeral, which would not last a year for a man of his habits.”
0xb92f7132b8373b29bc5519c83c61889577e0a477 “pyotr petrovitch, i beg you,” said dounia, “say no more of mr. svidrigaïlov.
0x44bde0d4156e0e21ff418523b7eac3eaff06531d it makes me miserable.”
0xad05f6fc9bf1d546363ff98589c8cf464fdb5a1f “he has just been to see me,” said raskolnikov, breaking his silence for the first time.
0x354715ca2e5eb4d79c70bac4d26a63b36136cd06 there were exclamations from all, and they all turned to him.
0x65cc08775122f7c447c46525c4b5ab3f869964d2 even pyotr petrovitch was roused.
0x0ee8b4a630d76d94acc0d80d47f36d274c786534 “an hour and a half ago, he came in when i was asleep, waked me, and introduced himself,” raskolnikov continued.
0x27a059a55537da109cbbf41a134130471844e9eb “he was fairly cheerful and at ease, and quite hopes that we shall become friends.
0x65860aeff82746878c9a6bbe8a46c0fdb6b7ee55 he is particularly anxious, by the way, dounia, for an interview with you, at which he asked me to assist.
0x6f67164ba6381c20e8bd6eb616dcce21d86c353e he has a proposition to make to you, and he told me about it.
0xb0588cb6d762fde88e7866bdabdfaba6e12cfe12 he told me, too, that a week before her death marfa petrovna left you three thousand roubles in her will, dounia, and that you can receive the money very shortly.”
0xb53dab1348c550f7b82703d10fa5bc4f9a2de55e “thank god!”
0xceb0b645154664d03084974d3a223a9b566f8b41 cried pulcheria alexandrovna, crossing herself.
0xad6128a2326019c9baf0c65bd17f62270b5b72dc “pray for her soul, dounia!”
0xc607a5caa3a7a64da188d20c07e04b9b81d37547 “it’s a fact!”
0xf37fc053dee03557c906ae9c817ec10bf40c5122 broke from luzhin.
0xbe89f1f6cd8d3e0cfeb69c09bc735a923ab24b14 “tell us, what more?”
0x366168d5e3457f9f560bc80dba0de1b3404be095 dounia urged raskolnikov.
0xe40c64f68afaddb2f4b0c54290b71e122addc319 “then he said that he wasn’t rich and all the estate was left to his children who are now with an aunt, then that he was staying somewhere not far from me, but where, i don’t know, i didn’t ask....” “but what, what does he want to propose to dounia?”
0x872a774cf879473e7538730fc44f4af4d4df5f55 cried pulcheria alexandrovna in a fright.
0xb964af02f2ee60ad4d641928e0425d5f9b530e53 “did he tell you?”
0xa00f66ccca0a0d5e24a747fa3544a07776ae36a4 “yes.”
0x579e2cc3eb87d97329feeca4386d77bd12a43c32 “what was it?”
0x7eed5bed3075cdbac03690cd8970a79995b456fd “i’ll tell you afterwards.”
0x3aa5fe349fca7513c247482495ea24a1f7ddf103 raskolnikov ceased speaking and turned his attention to his tea.
0xcf0d4fdd9f4d178a786948540db0e47fb4e00457 pyotr petrovitch looked at his watch.
0x1cbb6726e35ff773892e1db426ffc2ae3a6dfd27 “i am compelled to keep a business engagement, and so i shall not be in your way,” he added with an air of some pique and he began getting up.
0xcf9769317fc433ac8ea1173cd88650e6b6e2f0e4 “don’t go, pyotr petrovitch,” said dounia, “you intended to spend the evening.
0x43de0cc653745a2b9023ee94a254cf0a15f9736b besides, you wrote yourself that you wanted to have an explanation with mother.”
0xbce9c024b6a737a8995d37f1e5c6337073cc4f5a “precisely so, avdotya romanovna,” pyotr petrovitch answered impressively, sitting down again, but still holding his hat.
0x8dd33f223de532fc71d42a7d85c472e72b0d07e6 “i certainly desired an explanation with you and your honoured mother upon a very important point indeed.
0xd81ca8fda2c45fd7ab7f5fd4eb532c473fea9f16 but as your brother cannot speak openly in my presence of some proposals of mr. svidrigaïlov, i, too, do not desire and am not able to speak openly... in the presence of others... of certain matters of the greatest gravity.
0x5ae03221a31c584e2df233a65ddda51044084332 moreover, my most weighty and urgent request has been disregarded....” assuming an aggrieved air, luzhin relapsed into dignified silence.
0xe9a0eb6f161d2e1844b4d2bdffd933ad751ad5d7 “your request that my brother should not be present at our meeting was disregarded solely at my insistance,” said dounia.
0xea3ea4ef690613f16e736e1063f6856aad0c6188 “you wrote that you had been insulted by my brother; i think that this must be explained at once, and you must be reconciled.
0x6d69db39d28e6be736bc820c9831cdee91973dbd and if rodya really has insulted you, then he _should_ and _will_ apologise.”
0xb4563323425d30ed0a76c03f723c3894ef260c75 pyotr petrovitch took a stronger line.
0x8bb3318bbb39d1e4bbaf185988336f54ff6aac2c “there are insults, avdotya romanovna, which no goodwill can make us forget.
0x7077e8611d2e03da5810c016568d0d7cde5cbd30 there is a line in everything which it is dangerous to overstep; and when it has been overstepped, there is no return.”
0x2c644af5b01a7ed80fea6887d66e761df7a18e3c “that wasn’t what i was speaking of exactly, pyotr petrovitch,” dounia interrupted with some impatience.
0xfd697a975be7567647e3b002b69100a799706b6d “please understand that our whole future depends now on whether all this is explained and set right as soon as possible.
0x5002a965653c123fd40ddb29d8f51ea146891473 i tell you frankly at the start that i cannot look at it in any other light, and if you have the least regard for me, all this business must be ended to-day, however hard that may be.
0x8c70c91ad3b9f2f196896a5569af448ad9aaa06d i repeat that if my brother is to blame he will ask your forgiveness.”
0x6932fdb9c65a9680845bdebb746a2ff720f4968f “i am surprised at your putting the question like that,” said luzhin, getting more and more irritated.
0x13fa58b11a3ee15564a3c2c931ed74f750d4167a “esteeming, and so to say, adoring you, i may at the same time, very well indeed, be able to dislike some member of your family.

0xdf55e6050a62219c158e88d8ede9350a96f76810 my assuming the part of judge is as much a surprise for my brother as for you.
0xcd45870249db37a163af6277bc6438331c66c3dd when i insisted on his coming to our interview to-day after your letter, i told him nothing of what i meant to do.

0x211d6328de02ef941de9cba9c5521a2394d7efa9 i don’t want to be mistaken in my choice, and i must not be.

0xdd0f536083e98f18688e5ac18b475ada9b13eaa1 “avdotya romanovna,” luzhin declared huffily, “your words are of too much consequence to me; i will say more, they are offensive in view of the position i have the honour to occupy in relation to you.

0xa50ee1e00d8bd86e795e3ec25ee185f0f2de6dbf raskolnikov smiled sarcastically, razumihin fidgeted, but pyotr petrovitch did not accept the reproof; on the contrary, at every word he became more persistent and irritable, as though he relished it.

0x0f8f5959f1750eb5c2c0ae1a58c48508baf688de pulcheria alexandrovna was a little offended.
0x86074f564bf8d721cec7bbb065d82bd16d101c16 “you seem to think we are completely under your authority, pyotr petrovitch.
0x12d1e80c785aacb13393f9b73b4c7c437999388e dounia has told you the reason your desire was disregarded, she had the best intentions.
0x4b79e587593cc8271bbb5337246c6a34205c9ed2 and indeed you write as though you were laying commands upon me.

0x6d004fe219b66096de16784e3f41e2086ea3d2ce let me tell you on the contrary that you ought to show particular delicacy and consideration for us now, because we have thrown up everything, and have come here relying on you, and so we are in any case in a sense in your hands.”
0xa5f38a91bf39ffd119da6c660c24221b1f7a2e44 “that is not quite true, pulcheria alexandrovna, especially at the present moment, when the news has come of marfa petrovna’s legacy, which seems indeed very apropos, judging from the new tone you take to me,” he added sarcastically.
0xea0b085449b985d38a1516467168bb672b9ee413 “judging from that remark, we may certainly presume that you were reckoning on our helplessness,” dounia observed irritably.

0x8b92542ba8d8fcb55a78493b250be2e55ce868b8 “good heavens!”
0xfe21f45cad12407fc9e8dd89dfa8187a4d31cb4f cried pulcheria alexandrovna.
0xd41ca5b0e095874f970890ced5e252c0cc0ce7cd razumihin could not sit still on his chair.
0xead875e8e00c4f947ee1074d879b9b2d0fe92537 “aren’t you ashamed now, sister?”
0xfd03568d82921d86b84b1b32dd095b97f607a5b6 asked raskolnikov.
0xd7998d45de59d29b8af72fb1161673bd311e99ff “i am ashamed, rodya,” said dounia.
0xf9d835a726063f94ce247b207201991637ed8313 “pyotr petrovitch, go away,” she turned to him, white with anger.
0x11456418388b7e7b19adb8eddf10ad5546d6f4cd pyotr petrovitch had apparently not at all expected such a conclusion.
0x3b3b6664ead3526803b838443148ee1c61120f80 he had too much confidence in himself, in his power and in the helplessness of his victims.
0xcc54bdb6cfe33a123a4e7407fdc8be20a80bc401 he could not believe it even now.
0x13a80160434169e8e698ad1fb62ebd4cf7dcd712 he turned pale, and his lips quivered.
0x3e91bdf93404177313cfbd994549ebe4cd1c40e7 “avdotya romanovna, if i go out of this door now, after such a dismissal, then, you may reckon on it, i will never come back.

0x48678bf932c6067eb14c9c3315584af3d68d5d46 cried dounia, springing up from her seat.

0xdf2a3cc2a285d3e2f22a8d202c69c13872ddfa80 cried luzhin, utterly unable to the last moment to believe in the rupture and so completely thrown out of his reckoning now.

0xc028c2646a044210d7e39c639bb3636dd59fe9ad “what right have you to speak to her like that?”
0xec7e2e8eb0153e47e66f2814d4c144fe3d0a5e49 pulcheria alexandrovna intervened hotly.

0xf96acb763bb6f0349722fbe2fd85bc4ebfabf701 but pulcheria alexandrovna was furious.

0x24e29ea26a18da5eb624dd9c659c99d94ab133f5 what are you thinking about, pyotr petrovitch, it was you bound us, hand and foot, not we!”
0x0aa3a9adf67c7174702cc69ede5dfadbc633ad58 “enough, mother, no more please,” avdotya romanovna implored.

0x2ce28e382f6a0de7e9b920248f79ff7ba999cf60 cried razumihin, jumping up.
0x916ccb4fdfdab8549b2587cbe1445d72cb46c527 “you are a mean and spiteful man!”
0x5b8768fd32132784c9b4e9ed33ebcb68064f1050 cried dounia.
0x4ec4fba11c230588efe3a303a52500b926b57325 “not a word!

0x364f65678226d01a62b19979b7d6e9e0a130110e cried raskolnikov, holding razumihin back; then going close up to luzhin, “kindly leave the room!”
0xb1b057a273f8743e6372455d7d79abd8f5a46d26 he said quietly and distinctly, “and not a word more or...” pyotr petrovitch gazed at him for some seconds with a pale face that worked with anger, then he turned, went out, and rarely has any man carried away in his heart such vindictive hatred as he felt against raskolnikov.
0xbd6cb7c34f9f0e401533e6b861c0453e12705176 him, and him alone, he blamed for everything.
0x33506f8ea8782a44390b4591829c2a6a30c38a88 it is noteworthy that as he went downstairs he still imagined that his case was perhaps not utterly lost, and that, so far as the ladies were concerned, all might “very well indeed” be set right again.
0x9f988338235d26e0c68337b71fbeb82521aebc27 chapter iii the fact was that up to the last moment he had never expected such an ending; he had been overbearing to the last degree, never dreaming that two destitute and defenceless women could escape from his control.
0xcdc1d655309008bd62d76ee358ee79524c513da7 this conviction was strengthened by his vanity and conceit, a conceit to the point of fatuity.
0x8e180e0e72513479ada3ad73ad184a2f93473d0c pyotr petrovitch, who had made his way up from insignificance, was morbidly given to self-admiration, had the highest opinion of his intelligence and capacities, and sometimes even gloated in solitude over his image in the glass.
0xc01521534693593a6bd78f1b8f2810e8de14fb84 but what he loved and valued above all was the money he had amassed by his labour, and by all sorts of devices: that money made him the equal of all who had been his superiors.
0xc155318ee865f8f1f081d73007116f7ca3c3ae92 when he had bitterly reminded dounia that he had decided to take her in spite of evil report, pyotr petrovitch had spoken with perfect sincerity and had, indeed, felt genuinely indignant at such “black ingratitude.”
0x829e8ca7e237da47c8e1992762ebb26f6eb74525 and yet, when he made dounia his offer, he was fully aware of the groundlessness of all the gossip.
0xdb23510735418503fe970f48a950df5bcfb3d572 the story had been everywhere contradicted by marfa petrovna, and was by then disbelieved by all the townspeople, who were warm in dounia’a defence.
0xd19fdff9619caa304c67c8dd837326a358f8e1f0 and he would not have denied that he knew all that at the time.
0xcd2f974e64229b011feb79451a38ccdebed1a979 yet he still thought highly of his own resolution in lifting dounia to his level and regarded it as something heroic.
0x747835c996495f26139cfc5b628c22575950cb29 in speaking of it to dounia, he had let out the secret feeling he cherished and admired, and he could not understand that others should fail to admire it too.
0x5dc7725362cbc4da131eb89feea31338f2ed7e97 he had called on raskolnikov with the feelings of a benefactor who is about to reap the fruits of his good deeds and to hear agreeable flattery.
0x0e7e582c0d34cdcf292fcae68033d90639079c9d and as he went downstairs now, he considered himself most undeservedly injured and unrecognised.
0x6449351a62cb2cfd630db1d99ec90eeab7ec9fbc dounia was simply essential to him; to do without her was unthinkable.
0xba416b5787c89b16b90df1fc83f1abe94eab377e for many years he had had voluptuous dreams of marriage, but he had gone on waiting and amassing money.
0x98624ea3de2031ced9808862d0833d6372d0cb65 he brooded with relish, in profound secret, over the image of a girl--virtuous, poor (she must be poor), very young, very pretty, of good birth and education, very timid, one who had suffered much, and was completely humbled before him, one who would all her life look on him as her saviour, worship him, admire him and only him.
0x3d5fb275770f6139f7b1385b1c6b439e9ef10e78 how many scenes, how many amorous episodes he had imagined on this seductive and playful theme, when his work was over!
0x2a8d999b2c37aed1531582b14f916941c0c5d836 and, behold, the dream of so many years was all but realised; the beauty and education of avdotya romanovna had impressed him; her helpless position had been a great allurement; in her he had found even more than he dreamed of.
0xba74ca63ab55312125618504453ebdb1c5eb72ae here was a girl of pride, character, virtue, of education and breeding superior to his own (he felt that), and this creature would be slavishly grateful all her life for his heroic condescension, and would humble herself in the dust before him, and he would have absolute, unbounded power over her!... not long before, he had, too, after long reflection and hesitation, made an important change in his career and was now entering on a wider circle of business.
0x711f64439f6aa9b8b5dacc803c6375917b70eaf4 with this change his cherished dreams of rising into a higher class of society seemed likely to be realised.... he was, in fact, determined to try his fortune in petersburg.
0x41f3632756c68b230eda880dd73720043720aad5 he knew that women could do a very great deal.
0x97b4d2351e02d77723e7151c164551fd68d764e9 the fascination of a charming, virtuous, highly educated woman might make his way easier, might do wonders in attracting people to him, throwing an aureole round him, and now everything was in ruins!
0xb03846b3c00554ac1ed42aa41dea1d27381cf6ec this sudden horrible rupture affected him like a clap of thunder; it was like a hideous joke, an absurdity.
0x1849b032e7dbb65fa6f9a5e6a93180b518e2ab0d he had only been a tiny bit masterful, had not even time to speak out, had simply made a joke, been carried away--and it had ended so seriously.
0x9edde7a0a22c37b0827d73b0e6e734fe93c1a82d and, of course, too, he did love dounia in his own way; he already possessed her in his dreams--and all at once!

0x416d4377a75e6cafd00317648e327394a4e2aae7 above all he must crush that conceited milksop who was the cause of it all.
0x4d5b203cec3667bed8c62fdc82289d55cdc5950d with a sick feeling he could not help recalling razumihin too, but, he soon reassured himself on that score; as though a fellow like that could be put on a level with him!
0xaf21c56ad533a3df306101b761fdc4775394e66f the man he really dreaded in earnest was svidrigaïlov.... he had, in short, a great deal to attend to.... ***** “no, i, i am more to blame than anyone!”
0x69f3c20c276985a0a48a848151a04867154634e4 said dounia, kissing and embracing her mother.
0xa159a213a4ed16df455b7b18d74681635d5a5199 “i was tempted by his money, but on my honour, brother, i had no idea he was such a base man.

0xbd795ad87d562c9d74fe09847627206ae7a7e26e “god has delivered us!
0xc9a0eea2d1310b46075d05b4d5a961356a43142a god has delivered us!”
0x35373fbe33deaa649b8a36bf61c1cc87a86edb27 pulcheria alexandrovna muttered, but half consciously, as though scarcely able to realise what had happened.
0x332797a987301bde2635e4fa4d659a282e767272 they were all relieved, and in five minutes they were laughing.
0xfb7bed1d263effaab740ad718942736b60797d26 only now and then dounia turned white and frowned, remembering what had passed.
0x79bb3eeb804d960d5cd375293e860a6a57ce4a32 pulcheria alexandrovna was surprised to find that she, too, was glad: she had only that morning thought rupture with luzhin a terrible misfortune.
0x62b95c8272ed19076a5c7578988e8fd987d558be razumihin was delighted.
0x3404311ede3c9a379c662edce81994ebf34af06f he did not yet dare to express his joy fully, but he was in a fever of excitement as though a ton-weight had fallen off his heart.
0xd855d73a7357491fe1fe375528b9d2401f45cf24 now he had the right to devote his life to them, to serve them.... anything might happen now!
0xbbf13970374e7029941730783e82dac31c383a26 but he felt afraid to think of further possibilities and dared not let his imagination range.
0x3c77753f53a9b6bba2e1be823491f177b038bbfc but raskolnikov sat still in the same place, almost sullen and indifferent.
0x1c4c017fd7fc4f528ef1a29acd6472cd211bc299 though he had been the most insistent on getting rid of luzhin, he seemed now the least concerned at what had happened.
0xe0d776848b261594a19de2628b4e7524b8d90609 dounia could not help thinking that he was still angry with her, and pulcheria alexandrovna watched him timidly.
0x1ad32edd839bbdb7d2906f7565d88248773bb45d “what did svidrigaïlov say to you?”
0xc2f03784f11aa3f9d809cc2629831c5f377c444b said dounia, approaching him.
0x951d5037953c549d32c559e90cff5f6b65b35011 “yes, yes!”
0xfe21f45cad12407fc9e8dd89dfa8187a4d31cb4f cried pulcheria alexandrovna.
0x7a94ca7555ce623d975fc4b29088f2a98ebfe159 raskolnikov raised his head.
0xe1fc5f6da18513917b57fcbed49d5df2c2bc5fe8 “he wants to make you a present of ten thousand roubles and he desires to see you once in my presence.”
0xb3d9c66fcbfeb88aca4bfcb5a865e6b608a2eed0 “see her!
0xe33e7d87042370216143753ccf0be4a200586778 on no account!”
0xfe21f45cad12407fc9e8dd89dfa8187a4d31cb4f cried pulcheria alexandrovna.
0x68d671d5cc2c9ce21499fc8bd8f0b193eef5a0fe “and how dare he offer her money!”
0xf7232a474d97afba6a47d43e0b00f38ffae6fe49 then raskolnikov repeated (rather dryly) his conversation with svidrigaïlov, omitting his account of the ghostly visitations of marfa petrovna, wishing to avoid all unnecessary talk.
0x759b86aa6fe9d72ae9f65841b4203bf9fcf817f3 “what answer did you give him?”
0x4f5e44e437ed2364285e79c4345191ae7f8e142a asked dounia.
0x84afac9700fb04c20ca8b64b3b507bc2de7d4e51 “at first i said i would not take any message to you.
0xfc0de961f8a5dcb34bb2981364bbde8491dd45bc then he said that he would do his utmost to obtain an interview with you without my help.
0x8200022d18c191f8b3251e4fe7d113150d0b7c63 he assured me that his passion for you was a passing infatuation, now he has no feeling for you.
0xa10a5e1489e904755268fcbeecc696afca96291f he doesn’t want you to marry luzhin.... his talk was altogether rather muddled.”
0xe370ca4a332dcb4f2edf7b8df7e28450e0a0987c “how do you explain him to yourself, rodya?
0x2fe46cb35dc4f4806133d32c855eea05fa99f218 how did he strike you?”
0x557a1fc3a85c75c28f247493f4218afdd8952a90 “i must confess i don’t quite understand him.
0xf456747d8cd6ee043ecfc25e7348e082bfd0231c he offers you ten thousand, and yet says he is not well off.
0x883645339f50ad37c96fc2f0acdcd6e9cc5597dd he says he is going away, and in ten minutes he forgets he has said it.
0xeef1d2d9e46a937ca35883f7aff9721128169f61 then he says he is going to be married and has already fixed on the girl.... no doubt he has a motive, and probably a bad one.
0xb411c472b91cd9776b0a6fbd37649e31947e08d4 but it’s odd that he should be so clumsy about it if he had any designs against you.... of course, i refused this money on your account, once for all.
0x70f88de0028748e2746df434e53fff15816d0f2c altogether, i thought him very strange.... one might almost think he was mad.
0xb2ea6ed40aaa55bb2f89863487d35d1834047f85 but i may be mistaken; that may only be the part he assumes.
0xee2dc175a82482e60b03a35f4c3cdd356b81ad09 the death of marfa petrovna seems to have made a great impression on him.”
0xadc07011027ba976adfb6045d9511ed25a9dcd55 “god rest her soul,” exclaimed pulcheria alexandrovna.
0x4a22a94536bce3a9d8e4994c3a77b2f43ac4e713 “i shall always, always pray for her!
0x9cd2b30faa7cb936e57148ea6d375cdea0e34fa7 where should we be now, dounia, without this three thousand!
0x58e3792b662f1ac75f24feb43bf4e6f85dfcd421 it’s as though it had fallen from heaven!
0x9d073c81c78d4188793d8451f6cf481d93df1b75 why, rodya, this morning we had only three roubles in our pocket and dounia and i were just planning to pawn her watch, so as to avoid borrowing from that man until he offered help.”
0xac62ded9bd06a0fa6dca53cca885e320f1987428 dounia seemed strangely impressed by svidrigaïlov’s offer.
0x95ed29e514f15508a2a12c07810395ae74c02b16 she still stood meditating.
0x9a240da9d1ce5a69b5a3c023672e002e66b2816e “he has got some terrible plan,” she said in a half whisper to herself, almost shuddering.
0x71337279add2751067c2f8d90d88071eb4b05d2f raskolnikov noticed this disproportionate terror.
0x5ee37f3e5a746868160524106eefd60c8532d6bd “i fancy i shall have to see him more than once again,” he said to dounia.
0x625ffbee454229baa910793edf7aa33a135559f7 “we will watch him!
0x675e33fe66ee5693b80ffb44cb5eedc94565913d i will track him out!”
0x2dea6c8bdf9f744a3c5d1c2c32b2613db972b855 cried razumihin, vigorously.
0xf9dffd4e0593dd65c8e05c470e61c448b473cd11 “i won’t lose sight of him.
0x3e104cbb247113b613c84ce5d083471f8bc19426 rodya has given me leave.
0xfd3c77b02a6ca56930ee7f099e7daa4ab8e26e3f he said to me himself just now.
0xa26525ab662c8556c2f121d1835cbf7bb8204fcc ‘take care of my sister.’
0x08640534beb93634e60369701ce92a382262f1db will you give me leave, too, avdotya romanovna?”
0xa1ba848a39a54cee237de56766a7c51f740da4b8 dounia smiled and held out her hand, but the look of anxiety did not leave her face.
0x99bc98c7d196009922ed788edd3920e6f9b2b8b4 pulcheria alexandrovna gazed at her timidly, but the three thousand roubles had obviously a soothing effect on her.
0x7aa40f0a0805ee3d16f0ce9729cc3d588913c56e a quarter of an hour later, they were all engaged in a lively conversation.
0x5b0356436130d4184108eb8822d293d9119243a4 even raskolnikov listened attentively for some time, though he did not talk.
0xf54132cde3dac4360c6785075af0f622f1c85a08 razumihin was the speaker.
0x922b0eceb2c7a8d11f1a7609a0168857b1c5b7cc “and why, why should you go away?”
0xe3bcf911f9b1a6b2423fc083f97e824da0340b47 he flowed on ecstatically.
0x529a7bc1ba1bfdaac746ff08cb214728be05a6b0 “and what are you to do in a little town?
0x7549c3bb18c99c25d9381d822edcf93c19417d29 the great thing is, you are all here together and you need one another--you do need one another, believe me.
0xb2644bd1aefec463990877b73cae0190945d3e93 for a time, anyway.... take me into partnership, and i assure you we’ll plan a capital enterprise.
0xd7d86f69af48966fcce268617bb8a0cf313c1d15 listen!
0xc7ba0609d1cc97c54c6f0bbd56645c552cf9e245 i’ll explain it all in detail to you, the whole project!
0x5fb3f409c71aa6182906d506fe0ac348da64c6db it all flashed into my head this morning, before anything had happened... i tell you what; i have an uncle, i must introduce him to you (a most accommodating and respectable old man).
0x97647e89bc2d74783e6d4dea47f41c97852ba584 this uncle has got a capital of a thousand roubles, and he lives on his pension and has no need of that money.
0x4bf9a41351e849879b2a2387b4298a590f1e3f5d for the last two years he has been bothering me to borrow it from him and pay him six per cent.
0x60faba1bddcc60384c2f972f1fa366ab1bf1189a interest.
0x6f795dce4b883ca9f021725be31cd6a60f59ec05 i know what that means; he simply wants to help me.
0x07d57a548adaeaa20df8328fe456d7d628150b20 last year i had no need of it, but this year i resolved to borrow it as soon as he arrived.
0x34ea472efb5d1e404ad5b664d3986a1979a9730f then you lend me another thousand of your three and we have enough for a start, so we’ll go into partnership, and what are we going to do?”
0xdf15967598ca084a80fc260aadc086f44605c85d then razumihin began to unfold his project, and he explained at length that almost all our publishers and booksellers know nothing at all of what they are selling, and for that reason they are usually bad publishers, and that any decent publications pay as a rule and give a profit, sometimes a considerable one.
0xdc1dce1f900ed60459e3daf8c6a1ae094ec25eda razumihin had, indeed, been dreaming of setting up as a publisher.
0x7fa01168918e80fda8bd4985b8e316f2be5d9813 for the last two years he had been working in publishers’ offices, and knew three european languages well, though he had told raskolnikov six days before that he was “schwach” in german with an object of persuading him to take half his translation and half the payment for it.
0x83af60cee56a6e0f08798ded61bf44aaf4943de7 he had told a lie then, and raskolnikov knew he was lying.
0x7258d7c6081ccdf4d41d737d81e263cd25fa39b4 “why, why should we let our chance slip when we have one of the chief means of success--money of our own!”
0xdf448b2c45ba3b39d0de444d00745f5941d123c5 cried razumihin warmly.
0xcaf7cd924a6aaae48497b14fd583cc77cb840330 “of course there will be a lot of work, but we will work, you, avdotya romanovna, i, rodion.... you get a splendid profit on some books nowadays!
0x68842fff3832edc64bd22f4738260b2bd959e680 and the great point of the business is that we shall know just what wants translating, and we shall be translating, publishing, learning all at once.
0xd99b54b5568f8a13c3bd95c3f275a2527f7c3a80 i can be of use because i have experience.
0x8a7ae2bfb802c39764876b4e96c1ce3aa4b58a7b for nearly two years i’ve been scuttling about among the publishers, and now i know every detail of their business.
0x42d938c8274ee79a445313a69208e2edac6ad008 you need not be a saint to make pots, believe me!
0xb66dcd26861d866051d67943d3313678e6e92ed7 and why, why should we let our chance slip!
0x38e07b96bb2ab19c88300be5da55a63805dc8151 why, i know--and i kept the secret--two or three books which one might get a hundred roubles simply for thinking of translating and publishing.
0x84e1b0d14fed02aacd9a091e071fbc081ed62d45 indeed, and i would not take five hundred for the very idea of one of them.
0x178001b1690c57365780c5937e48ac3f9dee4ad5 and what do you think?
0xac6ba505f3bf086afc6e5b8105bd2851597c74bd if i were to tell a publisher, i dare say he’d hesitate--they are such blockheads!
0xa161547c112aaef29900d6afe6124228634558f5 and as for the business side, printing, paper, selling, you trust to me, i know my way about.
0xb3fa5f568220bc9c8eec3958aad0faeb7f5dc61e we’ll begin in a small way and go on to a large.
0xc19f26786800378388bc859fc070f776063c17dd in any case it will get us our living and we shall get back our capital.”
0x8d9e7adedf8ee3a2263ebc0a5c696ea51b174b08 dounia’s eyes shone.
0x0226f5faada50dae5bd016fac093f2a93d2bc597 “i like what you are saying, dmitri prokofitch!”
0x872d64908de9411a7cda4720f080878bbc75efda she said.
0xae63929b703908eb0f934c35ad0c308a8f770828 “i know nothing about it, of course,” put in pulcheria alexandrovna, “it may be a good idea, but again god knows.
0xdec33c0cd54ccd4867749a390c6c5349e9892254 it’s new and untried.
0x1b31efb89fb8b6385a961d967fd77c3114423479 of course, we must remain here at least for a time.”
0x288271d549c90e1937d732b948e82dc643558c11 she looked at rodya.
0x35f88365ed56332a0002aa8dd99224064b3ac45f “what do you think, brother?”
0x5747a08c47e0df39dbb6e564f37f3c0a57d33525 said dounia.
0xe77eee1e06677567079cac477d362921868dfcb7 “i think he’s got a very good idea,” he answered.
0x225d628388c69237a0467cafbbc9480206412675 “of course, it’s too soon to dream of a publishing firm, but we certainly might bring out five or six books and be sure of success.
0x5d04d38c12a4d8ca5dd3fa52d9b8a9023d9fc476 i know of one book myself which would be sure to go well.
0xab19fd60b7b234e1cbaa2af2f7a13827a1340e6e and as for his being able to manage it, there’s no doubt about that either.
0xd07c46812a6f0690ed044b85829915b7a528ed9b he knows the business.... but we can talk it over later....” “hurrah!”
0x7c4d547aee74a44436715f8c7bf5ee0ca8053140 cried razumihin.
0x084abcaea5cb4bcc5c8d06469e9c08ec126c25a7 “now, stay, there’s a flat here in this house, belonging to the same owner.
0x326f72ac134dd626325582d7872d2ae21ae47ae4 it’s a special flat apart, not communicating with these lodgings.
0x0235d99ddb007ff0af7cabe5667c99137b630079 it’s furnished, rent moderate, three rooms.
0x3437d835663a9e05a6930371c8de59229472c094 suppose you take them to begin with.
0x7ec225a9f665edb7e88a63fe9042a8753bc4a549 i’ll pawn your watch to-morrow and bring you the money, and everything can be arranged then.
0x617345e1e7aabee220ef1e0424f02804fe37bce1 you can all three live together, and rodya will be with you.
0xe06554ffa8f1f066f36616981507b4eaf939183d but where are you off to, rodya?”
0xc3caaa9922e9af9fbb206fedd4a5f4ce730522cd “what, rodya, you are going already?”
0xc8599d481dcc2e5b156f61c68ad0a3845ff8eb36 pulcheria alexandrovna asked in dismay.
0xeaa0b94b1893b8d1f40d116da41a3ec289095315 “at such a minute?”
0x7c4d547aee74a44436715f8c7bf5ee0ca8053140 cried razumihin.
0x61c76f8e5dac6dde87a5a33f6a8e4e22457e0413 dounia looked at her brother with incredulous wonder.
0xa1136bb51997d350bdce34072b20deea085db812 he held his cap in his hand, he was preparing to leave them.
0x22c9c7770f69055e211e8a2b40b218bf1d83da77 “one would think you were burying me or saying good-bye for ever,” he said somewhat oddly.
0x2995bfcad536afb3442df45f0432d055b8e803a0 he attempted to smile, but it did not turn out a smile.
0x6478ba8cb7b2f3c4a1ed6b5617119fad6622b3a9 “but who knows, perhaps it is the last time we shall see each other...” he let slip accidentally.
0x0ce79ca210b5abb6aaec9e2c794d6eb0762984e3 it was what he was thinking, and it somehow was uttered aloud.
0x35c2ffa7da0504636e68bec04c3e496b5a5b1b72 “what is the matter with you?”
0xc47769311a1f5329d43ac23ffa3ec033887dca02 cried his mother.
0x87ef1a5b0cc9c7032860e7bda5adf6156d67f67e “where are you going, rodya?”
0xc7f2d626ac9c467ed1c7ef716808af28493b2fdb asked dounia rather strangely.
0x912686b8bbb222f1558af59a49cddba1a93d0a9a “oh, i’m quite obliged to...” he answered vaguely, as though hesitating what he would say.
0x95a11e7e10f3c09c200abda7e593a16626981bc1 but there was a look of sharp determination in his white face.
0x9ea9635a9bff282d206908a21e32fe7ed1f5bce3 “i meant to say... as i was coming here... i meant to tell you, mother, and you, dounia, that it would be better for us to part for a time.
0xc38027d6a624056a46ac6c7ac01577bc8e2ea8a6 i feel ill, i am not at peace.... i will come afterwards, i will come of myself... when it’s possible.

0x511d71efd17522882016ec4f3d28d9440bce077d i decided this even before... i’m absolutely resolved on it.
0xa6091ccdbf80928357136e577d46022f0b1965b9 whatever may come to me, whether i come to ruin or not, i want to be alone.

0x5115f316f1a7d0d6406cf9e431434af2dd5cdcf3 don’t inquire about me.
0xf7f77ef769fc62fae4a139646bab0c5a6179d165 when i can, i’ll come of myself or... i’ll send for you.

0x6acf8b95b0d7967bfa0db2077e2289bde77e5a74 “good god!”
0xfe21f45cad12407fc9e8dd89dfa8187a4d31cb4f cried pulcheria alexandrovna.
0x58b2da3ca30a6b5014cd9623dd7dec8e5436ef5e both his mother and his sister were terribly alarmed.
0xaf024c59a581163baf4b1fbf7f336f95fb5ab6d5 razumihin was also.
0x1152480a3130f10430d9ca8e39c8bdf2958fdb56 “rodya, rodya, be reconciled with us!

0x1ff2a88b83fc78e777ced66a3584410cacf60a40 cried his poor mother.
0xbea2566146558ac337f97f8c8e3f068638b7bc42 he turned slowly to the door and slowly went out of the room.
0x2e7c04cc7eed1752209c38a542961334586e9db1 dounia overtook him.
0xd18d39f7d6adcd0c070499382532217106bff8ee “brother, what are you doing to mother?”
0xcc40112d8406df3f9398a11ee43c730158b5fcad she whispered, her eyes flashing with indignation.
0x2067654da076794238255efe98c559cd18753cce he looked dully at her.
0x925aad4ec72d93307c9cbcdea855626dc8f6848c “no matter, i shall come.... i’m coming,” he muttered in an undertone, as though not fully conscious of what he was saying, and he went out of the room.
0x420acffcdc0f39b847f52cd4dbb8d712f7354d71 “wicked, heartless egoist!”
0x5b8768fd32132784c9b4e9ed33ebcb68064f1050 cried dounia.
0x496a8b12f732417900ba745c6fc413140a449eac “he is insane, but not heartless.
0x64cabbd80ff7620ef65fbcf2199b8c3fcde9353f he is mad!

0x59be5f8a7d39cf3907c15a146004b5bb914be168 you’re heartless after that!”
0x5b8cd29e44251a38a76186b910cbf9e4d7132faf razumihin whispered in her ear, squeezing her hand tightly.
0x3f56ccfc9908a53a8cb194421edca54933fca731 “i shall be back directly,” he shouted to the horror-stricken mother, and he ran out of the room.
0x565d5333e1c4264baf7c141b7bc92d0ad4d8488c raskolnikov was waiting for him at the end of the passage.
0xb20e9e4dc788a4c17f60b5467e78147b9d54615f “i knew you would run after me,” he said.
0xc88325bb93d1089585a8c944977b42bf9e91009f “go back to them--be with them... be with them to-morrow and always.... i... perhaps i shall come... if i can.

0x4ddd190447639450ecd64f328a441a2dbc5f08ca and without holding out his hand he walked away.
0xe0aba592ee3465d5d3dfb4c8ad02f0ff4e2e8ee2 “but where are you going?

0x2e3af8c3e439ede067ede530bae19f12bce784dc razumihin muttered, at his wits’ end.
0x8c039cc22ec2ef976935fd595a3fa0793cc5aea0 raskolnikov stopped once more.
0xc86f457553dfdde056c52d126ff145e40e6c364b “once for all, never ask me about anything.
0xaba4f8c663fd3fb64400f577b0c718c26cee2dbc i have nothing to tell you.

0xb601ff52733a1eb3621ffd1d9df8133fc3de054e do you understand me?”
0x6a98c9994feb25afde2fb58d57e60cdcc80630a2 it was dark in the corridor, they were standing near the lamp.
0xfe4471897950124a84f3567e6c7c5aee24c59a63 for a minute they were looking at one another in silence.
0x4dc739dd7dce975d25612937f67e14e40aa3cc95 razumihin remembered that minute all his life.
0xf51ceb60ad5c62ca1e1a87338cc47db532b1e679 raskolnikov’s burning and intent eyes grew more penetrating every moment, piercing into his soul, into his consciousness.
0xbc6c36e24cedd2661d96e8b811df19587a49d985 suddenly razumihin started.
0x52392a5799986fd5d46fb8a8207ac0e8104068b7 something strange, as it were, passed between them.... some idea, some hint, as it were, slipped, something awful, hideous, and suddenly understood on both sides.... razumihin turned pale.
0xd766d21d76785038251a32619b6b6034dcd0d3b8 “do you understand now?”
0x90df456d137d5099c25f5ce0f6a9daad3811ffe3 said raskolnikov, his face twitching nervously.
0x5783835ba2e080856dc3bb6640306bebdaf459c3 “go back, go to them,” he said suddenly, and turning quickly, he went out of the house.
0x1d5e75c17915435b385ae275434b2f22a65d6948 i will not attempt to describe how razumihin went back to the ladies, how he soothed them, how he protested that rodya needed rest in his illness, protested that rodya was sure to come, that he would come every day, that he was very, very much upset, that he must not be irritated, that he, razumihin, would watch over him, would get him a doctor, the best doctor, a consultation.... in fact from that evening razumihin took his place with them as a son and a brother.
0x83f8dd314715fa5c2005f0a871685fdddcb8ac9b chapter iv raskolnikov went straight to the house on the canal bank where sonia lived.
0xabf6901406ae78895f59ebd396842edb58b11128 it was an old green house of three storeys.
0x52d2de5decbabd1cdc02835f33790b5cddbf9255 he found the porter and obtained from him vague directions as to the whereabouts of kapernaumov, the tailor.
0xa75be4e614967faf75160f055e712d971a53a35c having found in the corner of the courtyard the entrance to the dark and narrow staircase, he mounted to the second floor and came out into a gallery that ran round the whole second storey over the yard.
0xb825edbcba943c967db977535e243fe13fa4d052 while he was wandering in the darkness, uncertain where to turn for kapernaumov’s door, a door opened three paces from him; he mechanically took hold of it.
0xf02ab845616b95ff0a66081ad188d64a8a5fe42a “who is there?”
0x062a25cca56c5f0254b87a14a1b5640268aa2182 a woman’s voice asked uneasily.
0x488507f04f39e1792b16030cebcced41815c6e2a “it’s i... come to see you,” answered raskolnikov and he walked into the tiny entry.
0xfea71b03bf6f4dd271ce9c09bd2092e24eb1f5aa on a broken chair stood a candle in a battered copper candlestick.
0xeab962f4c4bd19fd175a5c7adfd91a8ead45014b “it’s you!
0x11ec8b845c58d67f9ccf077cdb47c8c8a8cc3fdc good heavens!”
0x73c2a54ee5bd8fb0e13cd032580303d8c34f6253 cried sonia weakly, and she stood rooted to the spot.
0xefe508d3bfaa28b1a974a076b8e91c1c76a472b4 “which is your room?
0xc6df9d05ac38e106321e26676401f13d669f3401 this way?”
0xa4b47aaa7bfff2720a86ce2014eb45f02b235ae1 and raskolnikov, trying not to look at her, hastened in.
0xacdd713e067aa26dd2fd24089c5c451a44a8d35c a minute later sonia, too, came in with the candle, set down the candlestick and, completely disconcerted, stood before him inexpressibly agitated and apparently frightened by his unexpected visit.
0x950ce5debdfb61e073cb33f2154d50b7baf4c011 the colour rushed suddenly to her pale face and tears came into her eyes... she felt sick and ashamed and happy, too.... raskolnikov turned away quickly and sat on a chair by the table.
0x43ad641ff5118497049fc6785c65d06f7e761f0e he scanned the room in a rapid glance.
0xdbba03098d9dffe855056e30fa52e4f216fe7721 it was a large but exceedingly low-pitched room, the only one let by the kapernaumovs, to whose rooms a closed door led in the wall on the left.
0x44f1252a846c1b7d6640e0944042281da1644638 in the opposite side on the right hand wall was another door, always kept locked.
0xb1195bb41de90d03e35adc00dc091d20e0298ae7 that led to the next flat, which formed a separate lodging.
0xb978c47a8eea9cfe126b95e98444d6090f1ce6d1 sonia’s room looked like a barn; it was a very irregular quadrangle and this gave it a grotesque appearance.
0xb75cef25dcfa57b7b725bffb0fa369803b0ccdc9 a wall with three windows looking out on to the canal ran aslant so that one corner formed a very acute angle, and it was difficult to see in it without very strong light.
0x0003bcce9b1b31877c945002c91854678fa2bd8f the other corner was disproportionately obtuse.
0xe98af1c72898b6337d6e015af7daf67aa80a6da1 there was scarcely any furniture in the big room: in the corner on the right was a bedstead, beside it, nearest the door, a chair.
0x00846bbc45328413561ae9d5ed0e689cd2c51235 a plain, deal table covered by a blue cloth stood against the same wall, close to the door into the other flat.
0x45ccb3f618053253fb04c2dd8aede7148a9ea661 two rush-bottom chairs stood by the table.
0xe3a624e6a9401361d6adbd5c9ce38bd5a2cd00a3 on the opposite wall near the acute angle stood a small plain wooden chest of drawers looking, as it were, lost in a desert.
0x364bb98bcd6adf5ac7e89453b246be51ceb4f952 that was all there was in the room.
0x28ebfa8a6d3926f1d9b36a389c17eb658783d79a the yellow, scratched and shabby wall-paper was black in the corners.
0x229b0355cd29139d6739f04a65228d5fcd7641f4 it must have been damp and full of fumes in the winter.
0x24e93f97859a185bea80c8630b3b7ec87ad8f3ee there was every sign of poverty; even the bedstead had no curtain.
0x0b337440001531f7ea4f96d6ac42a85ad5366d7d sonia looked in silence at her visitor, who was so attentively and unceremoniously scrutinising her room, and even began at last to tremble with terror, as though she was standing before her judge and the arbiter of her destinies.
0xd33ad2ae700823ebf0c2407ecf9df1d05a49f4e6 “i am late.... it’s eleven, isn’t it?”
0x5419dd3ffed5cc42613964a06a9d1cb112011926 he asked, still not lifting his eyes.
0x13fade4aa79c006ca0102ed090284e1351f45909 “yes,” muttered sonia, “oh yes, it is,” she added, hastily, as though in that lay her means of escape.
0x46ccb3c02e96838464a6ae9007985b01092e7315 “my landlady’s clock has just struck... i heard it myself....” “i’ve come to you for the last time,” raskolnikov went on gloomily, although this was the first time.
0x673bf5e6fab890723a0b0c731718cc0a2777ae6f “i may perhaps not see you again...” “are you... going away?”
0x6ea7b9ebdead0c0f93154738866e26beff93faf6 “i don’t know... to-morrow....” “then you are not coming to katerina ivanovna to-morrow?”
0x763c7778995a928e199f807a63087e1c984d6a74 sonia’s voice shook.
0xc12cc27bbe468589b06b59337c3d73265c90bda0 “i don’t know.
0x73b7670ef2f89b80328136b310ae36dacea441f7 i shall know to-morrow morning.... never mind that: i’ve come to say one word....” he raised his brooding eyes to her and suddenly noticed that he was sitting down while she was all the while standing before him.
0x8487a478a7bf08b6a2f73fcee0bdf580ae262c7e “why are you standing?
0x1927d45b54123930ce367173018a4688d98de474 sit down,” he said in a changed voice, gentle and friendly.
0xf1063e8a01228851bbe82b1a5ed7b88a43724560 she sat down.
0x36de285d003b12a8a33be5cad49a29eb90afb6e1 he looked kindly and almost compassionately at her.
0xbdb8c741b95adf446473a80871d1a6810b64c471 “how thin you are!
0x40dffd07fa6531b6818fb5594e3ac53d00029a5d what a hand!
0x14aa4a63ea3e36f274925470f305d235c9f313a4 quite transparent, like a dead hand.”
0xc1d518cab9575b20062c3e2a8b75e7e71bc7e85e he took her hand.
0x50026bc81d08925819984787928457de75014707 sonia smiled faintly.
0xde26a551b09d734759b328d01f45a564de2de5b2 “i have always been like that,” she said.
0x8d15d4bfb8db206e440965e2af92537b2d7ecdd5 “even when you lived at home?”
0xa00f66ccca0a0d5e24a747fa3544a07776ae36a4 “yes.”
0x28888d8acf4a9f727d872d0f96a2518bfa75c242 “of course, you were,” he added abruptly and the expression of his face and the sound of his voice changed again suddenly.
0x855c911a4ef578e74c59a998cf98290f56f16c2e he looked round him once more.
0xc8b92a92344a0dc51fbf965647ff0184e36c20b5 “you rent this room from the kapernaumovs?”
0xc25cd47869d5b8a44f22312ee1185740cf965f16 “yes....” “they live there, through that door?”
0xdad15a8c14fba5a60e8d131f1c0cb95c5c3b9b1c “yes.... they have another room like this.”
0xff95bafe58db89f95563b1be2d71beafc0d61a84 “all in one room?”
0xa00f66ccca0a0d5e24a747fa3544a07776ae36a4 “yes.”
0x2767ac4d1310d40a0f2fcee14a6994c3359da805 “i should be afraid in your room at night,” he observed gloomily.
0x1a90b86a75f577ec30aa68ac65fdd923dc16342f “they are very good people, very kind,” answered sonia, who still seemed bewildered, “and all the furniture, everything... everything is theirs.
0x08634e2a65c4a0c146f54d747e6844df86bf3b65 and they are very kind and the children, too, often come to see me.”
0x430f362308dd7f72f000ec557acf4cdd34970e02 “they all stammer, don’t they?”
0x5c166ac343baec9775ba583b09a59fe16b25abb2 “yes.... he stammers and he’s lame.
0xe395a0669d2c452ef9a5f53ae50276cb5b9da0be and his wife, too.... it’s not exactly that she stammers, but she can’t speak plainly.
0xda68fa9b4920b092cfef9996495f5527b08def76 she is a very kind woman.
0x29fabbe411f54a4d9bdb6ae1dd56f51763768ecd and he used to be a house serf.
0x4194c7670bbc1e6700c43b44a7a9cf2220a80f16 and there are seven children... and it’s only the eldest one that stammers and the others are simply ill... but they don’t stammer.... but where did you hear about them?”
0xcb7f5e3362cd3387483a749527b447100961a727 she added with some surprise.
0x926045c62cc818efba5657a79e4fe2da3777b1be “your father told me, then.
0xdaba563d5c279c51d099c05165a9f9c601ed0a97 he told me all about you.... and how you went out at six o’clock and came back at nine and how katerina ivanovna knelt down by your bed.”
0x7469135110a46f757b08c1e1cebb3a9b48d203fc sonia was confused.
0x23c263252ac34186e9a3559bf853a07b542ad7a7 “i fancied i saw him to-day,” she whispered hesitatingly.
0x57b5547085d49a0a7497c2122620aee29069fbb4 “whom?”
0x79a6b2f1fba68c79e875a3a81b31c13c3e0a7689 “father.
0x82aa428634b7b71adb8aba57fd17ab54e4894d41 i was walking in the street, out there at the corner, about ten o’clock and he seemed to be walking in front.

0x3ce3d97ab584b4156808ae48bc038c54ed21b8a1 “yes,” sonia whispered abruptly, again overcome with confusion and looking down.
0x3118b2f51b5e58321c03889f611ad1e6c561399a “katerina ivanovna used to beat you, i dare say?”
0xbb23c0835bdd818c3713e6a2d5d5c43738f329d9 “oh no, what are you saying?

0xd415e32e0a6290acb78d5c103681a051f53cf5c8 sonia looked at him almost with dismay.
0xbbf9dc32a87a96ff8279b5db43bf6bd2f728c5e3 “you love her, then?”
0x7301be88f2bfa328501c6114fc39ea863270bba1 “love her?
0x63d08c490a7c223ab7c9b30fc26a8e8f688fd290 of course!”
0xa41fb2ee51eca2d9c13bba4e08914ebd6be3ec40 said sonia with plaintive emphasis, and she clasped her hands in distress.
0x44e8d037f17bf8ce20941866ae7a98d562af176b “ah, you don’t.... if you only knew!

0x754dff64be9956e962cb8ee00f180d6efe15fe0a a sort of _insatiable_ compassion, if one may so express it, was reflected in every feature of her face.

0xa103b1898ba257164252f7944bfb7f69a2f1f7f0 what of it?
0x177b967db8434df41aaa88a5b6bb8a56168c85b3 you know nothing, nothing about it.... she is so unhappy... ah, how unhappy!
0xd9cd668f7ff337cae321bf58c81822dc012871e0 and ill.... she is seeking righteousness, she is pure.
0x73730b67f0acb4b2adcbcd1d627de23504fc7e47 she has such faith that there must be righteousness everywhere and she expects it.... and if you were to torture her, she wouldn’t do wrong.
0x20d4e3e3b3ea6334591d625aa1f21b4dd1a10592 she doesn’t see that it’s impossible for people to be righteous and she is angry at it.
0xc456fd99fbf65429384c698f39133e56273a7dec like a child, like a child.
0x2a40e044fe550b8f14d628eb0572fbca314aca84 she is good!”
0xbf9fbf59911c1e89a805eb282eb17e7d92a1d2de “and what will happen to you?”
0xc6f05d47f3c2b8fb7e2e7845677d765f6523d697 sonia looked at him inquiringly.
0x588670805d996bf1561cbe317991b87638ea21b2 “they are left on your hands, you see.
0x7e34a3a1a50558fc2f63402ab4c1ab2be414ff5d they were all on your hands before, though.... and your father came to you to beg for drink.
0xcf26103694ec5edcaa31638d04b373c0263dfd3f well, how will it be now?”
0x60e96560201f504a6aa568d56ef5c93048199064 “i don’t know,” sonia articulated mournfully.
0x6fd4445943f3f190be0b0bc3af074112c19a83d8 “will they stay there?”
0xae6e7a658b00c52c661dec8c1b38cb031e09fd5a “i don’t know.... they are in debt for the lodging, but the landlady, i hear, said to-day that she wanted to get rid of them, and katerina ivanovna says that she won’t stay another minute.”
0xef6f952e029a6ebe87afc5c314a581f28f14dcb0 “how is it she is so bold?
0x183ac11e03ac0bb51b4ea368736fe9656494b197 she relies upon you?”
0xb24f4c4b3212f72f7433b683f40cf4dade0843db “oh, no, don’t talk like that.... we are one, we live like one.”
0x87725fe0c1a24661eb8b31272b43dc2560de9f32 sonia was agitated again and even angry, as though a canary or some other little bird were to be angry.
0x8a02ae98df76dd178579027fa9a11dd3555e37e9 “and what could she do?
0xf972bebf8547eb9ee001908cb578e1bdf894b77b what, what could she do?”
0x5505da30ecbfe78a3a0270ee9f6d2b6a6f114d46 she persisted, getting hot and excited.
0xbc927257cd15c28e483e15dc001ef7dc2c181b94 “and how she cried to-day!
0xe515f90eab7203fe5c75b2beb86a91b6ea145132 her mind is unhinged, haven’t you noticed it?
0xd00d926db14d750d566bde88ee242891107c3e12 at one minute she is worrying like a child that everything should be right to-morrow, the lunch and all that.... then she is wringing her hands, spitting blood, weeping, and all at once she will begin knocking her head against the wall, in despair.
0xab1ecda1f9b145a9aed929aec007089490aa0d90 then she will be comforted again.
0xeb53e6194141809fe424fbbfd9912743a78acec6 she builds all her hopes on you; she says that you will help her now and that she will borrow a little money somewhere and go to her native town with me and set up a boarding school for the daughters of gentlemen and take me to superintend it, and we will begin a new splendid life.
0x44cea9e58b5e335faf4fcaf4bbcbe70b9c044d53 and she kisses and hugs me, comforts me, and you know she has such faith, such faith in her fancies!
0xb6df3ef45fb38ac380792e3418ee5fe55c7ff16d one can’t contradict her.
0x91a1a23fe7f3a77e5e3a180121dd75600bce7d62 and all the day long she has been washing, cleaning, mending.
0x21da893ff6635217ca3abb881a95f4a10116d456 she dragged the wash tub into the room with her feeble hands and sank on the bed, gasping for breath.
0x595678274af57f7b69724061d7087504c0539c99 we went this morning to the shops to buy shoes for polenka and lida for theirs are quite worn out.
0x172f470625e237d1e9d6ca0d7171bdff804caeef only the money we’d reckoned wasn’t enough, not nearly enough.
0xf1cb7fdb10c5bc45445a52a305e2cf82f24f47c7 and she picked out such dear little boots, for she has taste, you don’t know.
0x855421ac8a2a8010b65d19d4e43e96c16c5bd3ea and there in the shop she burst out crying before the shopmen because she hadn’t enough.... ah, it was sad to see her....” “well, after that i can understand your living like this,” raskolnikov said with a bitter smile.
0x07e119160010456f543cf6cc7de69ca2c08ca405 “and aren’t you sorry for them?
0x76ced0602b54d47a1e840bfb96cd0e11f5179c3f aren’t you sorry?”
0x2102c20a703d1b880748cc14221e3dce3363d000 sonia flew at him again.
0x24cd416f25cd0f3ae2b9e801a282c8e10ea945c6 “why, i know, you gave your last penny yourself, though you’d seen nothing of it, and if you’d seen everything, oh dear!
0xadc16a66523a0b744eadc927979bffe00192202f and how often, how often i’ve brought her to tears!
0xe8b222153019f0436fdacaea1bd3d0f3136fdf71 only last week!
0xc266baa4cec537189002e13e0ab1b42e13c5a0bf yes, i!
0x561eef3d70e84b97c72a3156c257ee544f2a0ed3 only a week before his death.
0x8010ed693b1d6fec80779ef636a6c70e54707efb i was cruel!
0x9018a19c37d068608b721fe1819e808a9f608467 and how often i’ve done it!
0xafa1cabfb8a094d11098fced8220de740217189b ah, i’ve been wretched at the thought of it all day!”
0xb9221f6db3cd4eee13860fceff1577a769319e36 sonia wrung her hands as she spoke at the pain of remembering it.
0x8b69f390bb3485c531f624afa12264a045b2eb13 “you were cruel?”
0x94f4b80b0a23fa50d8794114ee853a5103dc13f9 “yes, i--i.
0xedc1bc14941f9c0cd54af8d3f87214df9e14d560 i went to see them,” she went on, weeping, “and father said, ‘read me something, sonia, my head aches, read to me, here’s a book.’
0x344959673594adeee1b646797c5517961afd19e6 he had a book he had got from andrey semyonovitch lebeziatnikov, he lives there, he always used to get hold of such funny books.
0xc8dbe8a03728b68b1d71729baed81362f04baa68 and i said, ‘i can’t stay,’ as i didn’t want to read, and i’d gone in chiefly to show katerina ivanovna some collars.
0xa321448ae89229ccfa079a4ec7912692bf75c9f3 lizaveta, the pedlar, sold me some collars and cuffs cheap, pretty, new, embroidered ones.
0x367dbf9222d793e5fd4e38ae17c58edcfd54f464 katerina ivanovna liked them very much; she put them on and looked at herself in the glass and was delighted with them.
0x902424c5c7d9ff464551e8b24fb28aaf9228b8fa ‘make me a present of them, sonia,’ she said, ‘please do.’
0xfd796d17559ab3b9b8afd31d59ed40970c8c4224 ‘_please do_,’ she said, she wanted them so much.
0x6c24a205c1952c78d38d44bffe2711978fd341d1 and when could she wear them?
0xe5404563e0cbca99f766aee142adabe5af44e371 they just reminded her of her old happy days.
0xb5b7e88694c8c912de10547343449c4025040fa8 she looked at herself in the glass, admired herself, and she has no clothes at all, no things of her own, hasn’t had all these years!
0x2872ecf76d7262684bb8994f815f6a4a51f4a0e9 and she never asks anyone for anything; she is proud, she’d sooner give away everything.
0x7f3ef9ca1cdd7e03a8042d1d06b8b1cd6023dd09 and these she asked for, she liked them so much.
0xfa1fd18dae26825e3d119610e8b15fd74497901b and i was sorry to give them.
0x64d0b676e8e44cb9a27c5cece49090ae17886ff2 ‘what use are they to you, katerina ivanovna?’
0xd74c54feabaf29cd7a1879f37c529affd501afa0 i said.
0xb1f586198234e51b743e1102a3e127adc45201d0 i spoke like that to her, i ought not to have said that!
0xa86f6099c2b5ba0eb221856a8d27920260f1fad5 she gave me such a look.
0x01869fb82d41882b11e56f56c7598038ed21c6b4 and she was so grieved, so grieved at my refusing her.
0xefe09072619d62ef382026e3f3fd3a2f0459d2da and it was so sad to see.... and she was not grieved for the collars, but for my refusing, i saw that.
0x2da85330997dc87783f2e5e44f92a134ed5854c0 ah, if only i could bring it all back, change it, take back those words!
0x4e16f3972643c1d2e02c24623dfbba9bb8b6f97d ah, if i... but it’s nothing to you!”
0xb85d5867db1f91eed21fafe8f93a5b072e39239a “did you know lizaveta, the pedlar?”
0x63e881e73ee20b5681e29418afa775f56a5e31a8 “yes.... did you know her?”
0x20cdddf7ccb279f6eba22038a890a9310d932567 sonia asked with some surprise.
0x808b7343c79e04cba7b75cebdc3bb938cd4c0289 “katerina ivanovna is in consumption, rapid consumption; she will soon die,” said raskolnikov after a pause, without answering her question.
0x4541ddc92f4a292b23cf6e889040214dd91aed93 “oh, no, no, no!”
0xb8691716db00d945c722d226aa4f390b3f916701 and sonia unconsciously clutched both his hands, as though imploring that she should not.
0xf6591a7624681884c5dfbb0771041418a2ac2d2f “but it will be better if she does die.”
0xd0e8a8f4cbe582c96f91b64fb22b78e5186655ab “no, not better, not at all better!”
0x416541a1b53c4dd786d7f2a3133b91ac01ce70ff sonia unconsciously repeated in dismay.
0xe0f8280b5ea7738d0f5985f60d140aa6a70ce6d2 “and the children?
0x087e76f816398b9e5c709f42e9d8294b337eca33 what can you do except take them to live with you?”
0x60672972ed8fdf4e4b03e06f74dd8bc6f0adfea7 “oh, i don’t know,” cried sonia, almost in despair, and she put her hands to her head.
0x8690f2c0bcfaf0cbb41b862f53995919c31928ad it was evident that that idea had very often occurred to her before and he had only roused it again.
0xb277bc3281002d0ac74db89e77d48017c7c5ed1b “and, what, if even now, while katerina ivanovna is alive, you get ill and are taken to the hospital, what will happen then?”
0x1782e2f33b014eafff95940cc681ea98ceb062ab he persisted pitilessly.
0xe6a91f600653e8f6fa7edd7a0021760fb528f558 “how can you?
0xbdb4ce0d6074098da55f8b92085c51073126f67f that cannot be!”
0xba7df325d803fefb46fa49c131f1e45ac28442da and sonia’s face worked with awful terror.
0x38a19dee02470583333d55100e6c364e81988f5e “cannot be?”
0xa337c4401d02bda9c14e7029686dead70ae597b8 raskolnikov went on with a harsh smile.
0x3a30ab527ff4f38a535d92736e85696242c2e443 “you are not insured against it, are you?
0xcee11f920b22a748aabcb08f16b6f98b18f0fb72 what will happen to them then?
0x9865749b339738b86849d7880963531ddfd91f01 they will be in the street, all of them, she will cough and beg and knock her head against some wall, as she did to-day, and the children will cry.... then she will fall down, be taken to the police station and to the hospital, she will die, and the children...” “oh, no.... god will not let it be!”
0x6abb9884363044856fd1d8649f9ac3ab436d9d16 broke at last from sonia’s overburdened bosom.
0x2bee716b45c80dbf02f888521a09a9eee848e800 she listened, looking imploringly at him, clasping her hands in dumb entreaty, as though it all depended upon him.
0x11da23bf42b79bfdf33bf52e115d82f47efae510 raskolnikov got up and began to walk about the room.
0x61e837576fa52f3b7e24557b0d543eda046519a6 a minute passed.
0x5c83749cb0ca804b28daa3be932f5b3e04b6c735 sonia was standing with her hands and her head hanging in terrible dejection.
0x835d211e246502e5ef787128fc45a89c6cf2ba55 “and can’t you save?
0x3e95e91b4bd7f096a737afdfba7c0b703f7238e5 put by for a rainy day?”
0xc58c6e8c80a849de9516115efd2b5a2d7495df9f he asked, stopping suddenly before her.
0x2bb403a2aafb72f3496c8e0f347fbced17ed3824 “no,” whispered sonia.
0xbac6c8af5f6edd3b89e9d082ba3e9bf37976e4b1 “of course not.
0xb80342f29d206621e153a01c144b76ef981b9769 have you tried?”
0xea6212e906e40ec6392fcda39b512c22b75da8b2 he added almost ironically.
0xa00f66ccca0a0d5e24a747fa3544a07776ae36a4 “yes.”
0x146518e77bc83c36beff95958e340cb84202dfd7 “and it didn’t come off!
0x6c5abba9a43f641caa5417b3c5c6388a0b12d62f of course not!
0x0cedd877f35cad987edfa1dbbe94f5a5194beb4d no need to ask.”
0x652193f70b2929b2a259fee123aabcbe3083964f and again he paced the room.
0xe3cc4c5d3c746d73eca834ee51cb188af3db5cbd another minute passed.
0x07af023803c5be7690e678c80ed15a2cb8e2dd28 “you don’t get money every day?”
0xcb9bd43c22ac9bfb95e802af5edcc8c4c0f9b6e2 sonia was more confused than ever and colour rushed into her face again.
0x0d43c681553731bcdff22eaf78e732c96217062c “no,” she whispered with a painful effort.
0x9e7be662dc6340528576efa73dcea0a7e1cc7139 “it will be the same with polenka, no doubt,” he said suddenly.
0x2c7aefa5c21d0c0559da195f6a63ab06e7f2fd66 “no, no!
0x940ae77008c03417671cab4516ffe4889f667f4d it can’t be, no!”
0x418786e2c8ddd458fddbbf8856e5246b227104e5 sonia cried aloud in desperation, as though she had been stabbed.
0x3c70cc9a9168b4b5c1504309aaea71e5ebeca24b “god would not allow anything so awful!”
0x2ded24defc83e81c81101a433dcbcc175b321390 “he lets others come to it.”
0x2c7aefa5c21d0c0559da195f6a63ab06e7f2fd66 “no, no!
0x04ecdd858466f9fc0c2705bcae5975d636d730e4 god will protect her, god!”
0x2498b72d9749244707bd9bf2c2b32aa1b03cf1d0 she repeated beside herself.
0x307324265a333b5ff3f9c2c83b1c80bf497d935d “but, perhaps, there is no god at all,” raskolnikov answered with a sort of malignance, laughed and looked at her.
0x8c9fccb40ad54c4e31c1c716581b3a348de2e2d1 sonia’s face suddenly changed; a tremor passed over it.
0x1fb7d095de8c2f00f2d3f994e12eb442c36d6623 she looked at him with unutterable reproach, tried to say something, but could not speak and broke into bitter, bitter sobs, hiding her face in her hands.
0x3eb786b61412ce87208848af04504953efe5f503 “you say katerina ivanovna’s mind is unhinged; your own mind is unhinged,” he said after a brief silence.
0x7aa8ee312f37a33dd60be480a5733892ee7bf871 five minutes passed.
0xbaa49a1d5335869071563d57b93dbfe41b2058d0 he still paced up and down the room in silence, not looking at her.
0x5021bf9eb81b85f1f0f776174d3731aa83ddb57a at last he went up to her; his eyes glittered.
0x1cd0c5131836a80b6e2e6192daa066a1ccbabb02 he put his two hands on her shoulders and looked straight into her tearful face.
0x233a32785a5fd1fca96dc2411686c19e46f345a7 his eyes were hard, feverish and piercing, his lips were twitching.
0x3c20dc8664aa8af71f6bb1c5791cbf7db05ce0c0 all at once he bent down quickly and dropping to the ground, kissed her foot.
0x42b51ccc7cf94aaec16dc54431a28dde6beb5f8d sonia drew back from him as from a madman.
0xee63e685133234e7df170d0640ba4394c15d0298 and certainly he looked like a madman.
0xb4b5410df86adf0c4755449106b5dfef0598bdc4 “what are you doing to me?”
0x538a6dc61a2e07ff94ca2c8e8edace26fd456577 she muttered, turning pale, and a sudden anguish clutched at her heart.
0x90d1ebc0f504d0cc8cabb668895a1d8aa0607ed5 he stood up at once.
0xba7ae35b92d87f394940781024a66fb0986cd0f3 “i did not bow down to you, i bowed down to all the suffering of humanity,” he said wildly and walked away to the window.
0x7f1e90930157443857f693065b12e808bdf132ae “listen,” he added, turning to her a minute later.
0xbdc0ce32ac419d01b53a9ba0fb2322429acfbdf3 “i said just now to an insolent man that he was not worth your little finger... and that i did my sister honour making her sit beside you.”
0xa1d0967ffb5f3f05469ed37bd9204d9910e89500 “ach, you said that to them!
0x63703428ffcb6ee7f5a340f74cc2ee285871cfbb and in her presence?”
0xfb47bff0937ce5d225e06b38d35a07e5d26e1736 cried sonia, frightened.
0xc81601599fe3fdd4b87c6b634865a2c9cbb394ce “sit down with me!
0xa67a26cbeffbeab2276184070689e2d9c0e07d9a an honour!
0x353f50b53bbe6c7fdb420880405381a13d5080c6 why, i’m... dishonourable.... ah, why did you say that?”
0x58c142353d5d179d73c56d7fd2f1acde6542c3fd “it was not because of your dishonour and your sin i said that of you, but because of your great suffering.
0xc9087633baa9deae577378e5cad6b14c5b0337bc but you are a great sinner, that’s true,” he added almost solemnly, “and your worst sin is that you have destroyed and betrayed yourself _for nothing_.
0xb5a3c6ff9e69c57cf15b92cc3dae09d35c3f552c isn’t that fearful?
0x249a44650a755078f9551737550ace97f6d03a66 isn’t it fearful that you are living in this filth which you loathe so, and at the same time you know yourself (you’ve only to open your eyes) that you are not helping anyone by it, not saving anyone from anything?
0x443ef6e7398b9c77c52db0b4587a3652819daa0d tell me,” he went on almost in a frenzy, “how this shame and degradation can exist in you side by side with other, opposite, holy feelings?
0xf2593a282fa062ada74409eba4343fc79dd194ec it would be better, a thousand times better and wiser to leap into the water and end it all!”
0xab22dd29c8676f0eaca4eafb7b01a7b13a1fd4ae “but what would become of them?”
0x2b818c13c7e1ce788db18cca5d7e9e6f7d33a147 sonia asked faintly, gazing at him with eyes of anguish, but not seeming surprised at his suggestion.
0x7c9007ca52cf6f645ae2e125295d7d0828a20085 raskolnikov looked strangely at her.
0x89a307d78b77007be6b03a2eeacb2f30dda020a9 he read it all in her face; so she must have had that thought already, perhaps many times, and earnestly she had thought out in her despair how to end it and so earnestly, that now she scarcely wondered at his suggestion.
0xde6c7265cbce39aedd7a6299da34bddc8fe8f95d she had not even noticed the cruelty of his words.
0xc4ede2a89a541c8bfc77823637398763a5efb83e (the significance of his reproaches and his peculiar attitude to her shame she had, of course, not noticed either, and that, too, was clear to him.)
0x6216d0e35cf8b7bddb4f4ce0d3dccf666a3388cb but he saw how monstrously the thought of her disgraceful, shameful position was torturing her and had long tortured her.
0xee1fb9bbb975860cec05a1f71593b88706c787d9 “what, what,” he thought, “could hitherto have hindered her from putting an end to it?”
0xd8a305d8230fd8e7bbb4dda1a4dbb294a2c5fe05 only then he realised what those poor little orphan children and that pitiful half-crazy katerina ivanovna, knocking her head against the wall in her consumption, meant for sonia.
0x53fb2e444b7af937619e93a4a6744256b829d4e8 but, nevertheless, it was clear to him again that with her character and the amount of education she had after all received, she could not in any case remain so.
0x5874b9a27626a151c32f475fff53f1e7f5c0f662 he was still confronted by the question, how could she have remained so long in that position without going out of her mind, since she could not bring herself to jump into the water?
0x4ea54e419a82063fafbfb2df87b3ebaf9a718aee of course he knew that sonia’s position was an exceptional case, though unhappily not unique and not infrequent, indeed; but that very exceptionalness, her tinge of education, her previous life might, one would have thought, have killed her at the first step on that revolting path.
0x6d39cbd86142134b99beb815893d3b95785e1abc what held her up--surely not depravity?
0x450b8c33d8293e47c39405ff068f62806f9d9186 all that infamy had obviously only touched her mechanically, not one drop of real depravity had penetrated to her heart; he saw that.
0x405b8e8f0777b869ef5504b042f22157f085456c he saw through her as she stood before him.... “there are three ways before her,” he thought, “the canal, the madhouse, or... at last to sink into depravity which obscures the mind and turns the heart to stone.”
0x610b6c950afc392d84140510213857e7f791242d the last idea was the most revolting, but he was a sceptic, he was young, abstract, and therefore cruel, and so he could not help believing that the last end was the most likely.
0x4b102047ca1df3bbcddaec4c83738047f51e25b5 “but can that be true?”
0x3cd3c037205aae9db11bbd65f5d59089b87354ab he cried to himself.
0xa691c0fd6256560dacaa84c0f86aac6c79503d9e “can that creature who has still preserved the purity of her spirit be consciously drawn at last into that sink of filth and iniquity?
0xe97cdd983fdc8eeb8e3ce5a8016d8e09d6de0f05 can the process already have begun?
0x1fd7ca3e30ec3204e8d8201d4d96679b8ff5c022 can it be that she has only been able to bear it till now, because vice has begun to be less loathsome to her?
0xf2fe05cf1da39069231a38ae44609fe59c12e064 no, no, that cannot be!”
0x9f09c312905ed4c6a7cfae31a53275ce876f3fb4 he cried, as sonia had just before.
0xa6c18997297f910ae78849d349e09d615f94cd30 “no, what has kept her from the canal till now is the idea of sin and they, the children.... and if she has not gone out of her mind... but who says she has not gone out of her mind?
0x6479651b6d126b493ad3db94cc3609d7c5cd8626 is she in her senses?
0x5b4aec9aafca02528bf9f1825fe3c6c73218d658 can one talk, can one reason as she does?
0x39fe978177ccc8c081dc5fee04e44783b8aeb76a how can she sit on the edge of the abyss of loathsomeness into which she is slipping and refuse to listen when she is told of danger?
0xbfe573b916b1f05fca26a65d86f4eadf83924c99 does she expect a miracle?
0x08c07eaad3cd8b6ed3713c2b8ddea7624fb884dc no doubt she does.
0x2bd8caf9b9347610de6fef3249d881a0503562a9 doesn’t that all mean madness?”
0x4b4769e5281bf20adaec41d4f6a69c1bb28ff194 he stayed obstinately at that thought.
0x442628ef1562ff4e5375c3de3988ff291a794fb9 he liked that explanation indeed better than any other.
0xd98cf7cde26dd80756c662b9e8aa66402db23e3d he began looking more intently at her.
0xc295693558e0c9173ae833d7f1e4414bced08c95 “so you pray to god a great deal, sonia?”
0xb6d06b6d5f6ecacfe1891a4fd8c1951529104558 he asked her.
0x52fb7543a71842bb642ef88bfde4a1e625be034f sonia did not speak; he stood beside her waiting for an answer.
0x951cf557bb9fbdee7eb709c06d8308f3bac02d6b “what should i be without god?”
0x312cd799f923482870d51378e2b4e672cfdae1c9 she whispered rapidly, forcibly, glancing at him with suddenly flashing eyes, and squeezing his hand.
0x4cb792cd56e9acb06dbeeab28d9001e46d6ba20b “ah, so that is it!”
0xf5eb9a7700c47f1c638e42f6143a3df6b0941693 he thought.
0x0b337e25813b2bdbeebb4f9a2ab5fe7be5c9fd37 “and what does god do for you?”
0xac5d9018eb2d4634b3ebf9e139d867f9e7e7939b he asked, probing her further.
0x3c8ab579e36d99aacdacdf762b0bea5313e3a9f3 sonia was silent a long while, as though she could not answer.
0x30d0010c6d892ff7a53b7e350abea25de5f2864a her weak chest kept heaving with emotion.
0xb174b9cd9e7100a032ca988391e89df469e5bc87 “be silent!
0xa11ff2a8d5f20d7f3d481a3685187095f9ea99c2 don’t ask!
0x8d58fb29da7d50c9048a5d9a58c18312aeb74aae you don’t deserve!”
0xbf1384b0047e7eab0b24d586d4e104829d261a1d she cried suddenly, looking sternly and wrathfully at him.
0x7b253c6500fb304976b57ac4d59347559da3c459 “that’s it, that’s it,” he repeated to himself.
0x9912d78cadb58c247e960f96265b44b531c2396c “he does everything,” she whispered quickly, looking down again.
0x767878237e82d5480a58dd8b73b47dcd52d29f7a “that’s the way out!
0x45159bc93b9bd2685a072ca2f310ace61f99546e that’s the explanation,” he decided, scrutinising her with eager curiosity, with a new, strange, almost morbid feeling.
0xc5c43d7ad6e136731993d741d59dd8f017ed1243 he gazed at that pale, thin, irregular, angular little face, those soft blue eyes, which could flash with such fire, such stern energy, that little body still shaking with indignation and anger--and it all seemed to him more and more strange, almost impossible.
0x7d55253beded29f685fd9c44196ef71e4c13afc6 “she is a religious maniac!”
0x5601e274f1cae20b262ee52ad0a4f009a80ec415 he repeated to himself.
0xa12492dc59b90cd8c4141aa549ca2af9ad552c05 there was a book lying on the chest of drawers.
0x01760cb7dc169999e0ae0ef7700848cab1163174 he had noticed it every time he paced up and down the room.
0x750bb7f48da45b010d946eb62171ca422360fc7c now he took it up and looked at it.
0xcde60c73691c982f3cc273b21d98d19229866c59 it was the new testament in the russian translation.
0xbdeaf1686847d5879aca16d08a8c011416e2eb29 it was bound in leather, old and worn.
0x0837673c8b6678ebe7c7d252e8dd7f8cb0aaab8b “where did you get that?”
0xa736f1de93f2a9737a4e0e50a90e528b54fde375 he called to her across the room.
0x6bd8a30e425f1e92e2d4e6b2d4d70af898939e37 she was still standing in the same place, three steps from the table.
0x563cbd833a23f91f76880620f67a8cfaa49320ca “it was brought me,” she answered, as it were unwillingly, not looking at him.
0x2e6ac0d155382987f1d358d016ebc3a1c39f9531 “who brought it?”
0xf9147d2bd95c22a9cb68e69651f957039a9d1087 “lizaveta, i asked her for it.”
0x1846ed3f3d586f1aff94f0b8521d7fb4e6287212 “lizaveta!
0x223ad1fc5c6091ac4cb85cab7d66ff65a983a432 strange!”
0xf5eb9a7700c47f1c638e42f6143a3df6b0941693 he thought.
0x7f2eb2b0761eae0ac5d44dd487489ec6b357b3a9 everything about sonia seemed to him stranger and more wonderful every moment.
0x45a6a7aff86d4b103c0303979e35600d7a4ebb79 he carried the book to the candle and began to turn over the pages.
0x56240eea46d4b16fc1e896cf6c96cad1a7d9c553 “where is the story of lazarus?”
0x268b1c58e544f669e6d7289969fec55677d45fff he asked suddenly.
0xae2151a382231255660a7bed3c5ada0fd8e5c9f8 sonia looked obstinately at the ground and would not answer.
0x42bd472e126fc5c69cb31ac2929001e4ed30ec6f she was standing sideways to the table.
0x3a1557d6d28394b92c9a339b37f8fe3bab0d0fa1 “where is the raising of lazarus?
0x729f251500f41e1c99e73a0e7ec44c77a9043c8e find it for me, sonia.”
0x21819fb3b3c4d94135e014c3786f808f2309cbb2 she stole a glance at him.
0x63468c9db130700788f7b44dd2782a32af4f3cdd “you are not looking in the right place.... it’s in the fourth gospel,” she whispered sternly, without looking at him.
0xbc961228b2f271cae98d43276ece485b400d019c “find it and read it to me,” he said.
0x78849a4ced6fbd8d7b257b47e718ff581393c3e1 he sat down with his elbow on the table, leaned his head on his hand and looked away sullenly, prepared to listen.
0x7631d0e1f1c03e7ffdc92a11c239b5dd83b515bc “in three weeks’ time they’ll welcome me in the madhouse!
0xc2e5e5105dde1d1d87de4fa6b43c9e7c0ad07c30 i shall be there if i am not in a worse place,” he muttered to himself.
0xa30e25b440cb930fa1e762483509274954c3fb4f sonia heard raskolnikov’s request distrustfully and moved hesitatingly to the table.
0xcc714103e93dbe5acf873e4e73c9cf3c27632fc7 she took the book however.
0x255af35687bf3b874ee00c36eb96fdc4bec48468 “haven’t you read it?”
0x85babb0ebf4c0db6826adeb5148270fc987b6e10 she asked, looking up at him across the table.
0x6161b493ffc3db71095cee801e04702561a73a8d her voice became sterner and sterner.
0xb546f3bd214bd1d5225881df4f224bf03ac1835b “long ago.... when i was at school.
0xb7f34341ed103411f577668c2730538fcafdf0ab read!”
0x33f0c049df6cc4e9193293562e805f631ff4d099 “and haven’t you heard it in church?”
0x452806442994b0b9edb442e40c2c90d46161dc82 “i... haven’t been.
0x7d0fc175e5e21d8c36d4ceae82f0a88134080532 do you often go?”
0x97879c5d20f3ebee16ea165bf36ff5aacbfd77d0 “n-no,” whispered sonia.
0xfdd4db54f2e29804a38e150fa6c520a2f800f621 raskolnikov smiled.
0x5cc7c0d89a274c1539fae6b642781c3a157ee8bd “i understand.... and you won’t go to your father’s funeral to-morrow?”
0x486ec1436ba5176e087bbbde013d01da4d4136ad “yes, i shall.
0xf74afadafda460809a644aaf0ab45a9e09092307 i was at church last week, too... i had a requiem service.”
0xb66ab864ac7a3b1bb25aaca73de506e1518d2542 “for whom?”
0x595ace9924db3e5260408fcc5b6e85aa7af7a8b0 “for lizaveta.
0x62c0f2faf6dcb8773433126c9db73d1797739281 she was killed with an axe.”
0x373fe296b44ffa3b2c4c086948741d66f9c46ba2 his nerves were more and more strained.
0x9315491f2a404ef9e72735cedffbc0958c463321 his head began to go round.
0x0f68ea3627c613a0d121672abed16ad74f4a3b3e “were you friends with lizaveta?”
0x2b2fb317ff8a6ddad69824d571b2e6aae51760cd “yes.... she was good... she used to come... not often... she couldn’t.... we used to read together and... talk.
0x9d16f16e94bba6c28a0581e76681ca6db55f973d she will see god.”
0x8ce861eb5565e5ccd1bf1352ebfd9f196c031a2e the last phrase sounded strange in his ears.
0x157c1697fe514620025ced6a8975cf0df0e97442 and here was something new again: the mysterious meetings with lizaveta and both of them--religious maniacs.
0x1dba76aa3fb6985adace4bf5ad160b32f08a50fc “i shall be a religious maniac myself soon!
0xdbf474e4e27d4f3b275f45aa3b32842e92f8e4cd it’s infectious!”
0x19c24560d89e80ba86a487eac17a81bdb507d4c6 “read!”
0x70b3e87b4c333389bfb5c450043017d6e774dc71 he cried irritably and insistently.
0x6af39c53bf3825a6734465474fbd170a0d8a0d26 sonia still hesitated.
0x87da64bbf4dc67351bc136f7cc1c36cd8b8d1e80 her heart was throbbing.
0x5cfdb91e532e4bc733c1a8f3f12c48f8539838bc she hardly dared to read to him.
0xc4732af73069dc532dbe88f2e09412847b4f487b he looked almost with exasperation at the “unhappy lunatic.”
0x80035786990bdfe12d8c13de0a3a070722a2df7a “what for?
0x0ba7015fd7683a3da44f736fc4b58d751c44fa55 you don’t believe?...”
0xc4e6a57bd71df8c970d1f0912c99dd66290fe8a5 she whispered softly and as it were breathlessly.
0x0572fd57bf899154f59929fbd1d465378cd6990e “read!
0xea8454aeb9cc93b25f499cb0ea3f8a316e98b084 i want you to,” he persisted.
0x05df58074f0858cc50902eebcdd09e1ee2fd2be5 “you used to read to lizaveta.”
0x58857eaa8acefaad8adb8e3ee1aa830ade65b95a sonia opened the book and found the place.
0xfa938664c74d92d48fdc313a942eb6abf25cf7d9 her hands were shaking, her voice failed her.
0x1de9492dbac52f13b57b2eb0617debc418ca018d twice she tried to begin and could not bring out the first syllable.
0x80d9bb5c5721463089fc6ea156f8b14e31feeac7 “now a certain man was sick named lazarus of bethany...” she forced herself at last to read, but at the third word her voice broke like an overstrained string.
0xbcbdef2d97532fd783340135c0066d6b991201d7 there was a catch in her breath.
0x2cf566b65a9149eac89920a43900dfc489df382a raskolnikov saw in part why sonia could not bring herself to read to him and the more he saw this, the more roughly and irritably he insisted on her doing so.
0xcd607f56689e4ac4a22ace5d1622089b5c923b6b he understood only too well how painful it was for her to betray and unveil all that was her _own_.
0x977bfd827e974a5140c5121607ceedbe33c46d02 he understood that these feelings really were her _secret treasure_, which she had kept perhaps for years, perhaps from childhood, while she lived with an unhappy father and a distracted stepmother crazed by grief, in the midst of starving children and unseemly abuse and reproaches.
0x96e099f2a748ead2308bb8db85352c7504ea0b47 but at the same time he knew now and knew for certain that, although it filled her with dread and suffering, yet she had a tormenting desire to read and to read to _him_ that he might hear it, and to read _now_ whatever might come of it!... he read this in her eyes, he could see it in her intense emotion.
0xc596161125c04ac978ea5e7831b9b874d914eeb6 she mastered herself, controlled the spasm in her throat and went on reading the eleventh chapter of st. john.
0x9e71d30a78c8199b10df74c84109fe7062d1654a she went on to the nineteenth verse: “and many of the jews came to martha and mary to comfort them concerning their brother.
0xed746f5cd8a89d7984fca88a14de63f9945f2cf2 “then martha as soon as she heard that jesus was coming went and met him: but mary sat still in the house.
0xe25cd674181f241b1f931384d59590f6a0714103 “then said martha unto jesus, lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.
0x7e47b8b8514b71a139f77b06f99df9b5a2a91720 “but i know that even now whatsoever thou wilt ask of god, god will give it thee....” then she stopped again with a shamefaced feeling that her voice would quiver and break again.
0x5214c666d8fa1fa35a2120d7e962fa595cefe0f9 “jesus said unto her, thy brother shall rise again.
0xc8d6dd559a24ca4b2e76c7ff5f3d61c99984ca3c “martha saith unto him, i know that he shall rise again in the resurrection, at the last day.

0xf147399cea3cd54b769b4b131da8053dc9d68a8c she still trembled feverishly.
0x552c3256ecfb2be852afea1891f12e1a4a36880f the candle-end was flickering out in the battered candlestick, dimly lighting up in the poverty-stricken room the murderer and the harlot who had so strangely been reading together the eternal book.

0x32cd76f1bb825ece8826e282f3afc22d4a74eb3a his face was particularly stern and there was a sort of savage determination in it.

0x7bb47cee2dddde874301a070520a15306d1c1f31 “go where?”
0x8c69334c0e9cb7c3c9f811df0246ece5ab7c8fd6 she asked in alarm and she involuntarily stepped back.

0xebee7a1cec6555bc380ef55f40678ffc682dc464 “why, do you know who killed her?”
0x685b98089c28a8139cfb5eb13adac0503cd9ea33 she asked, chilled with horror, looking wildly at him.

0xd30df296521877b14bc4a8df05e9f9ab7c591ce3 he went out.
0x118ee30856a03106808eb6403de91b01f3e8ae1b sonia gazed at him as at a madman.
0x91e7b662d5b8b7d95871cfa11822afb956fc3118 but she herself was like one insane and felt it.
0x80e37b5fe1db69d6833cf88b1a9ce76da709e0b5 her head was going round.
0xd5ae8780c8d8d8af28ad03e8c2ab4f6104546dd4 “good heavens, how does he know who killed lizaveta?

0xc00203bdd7276d156bcfaa65b3e73ae979a80e44 but at the same time _the idea_ did not enter her head, not for a moment!
0x9b322f877f2d09316b3ca7036383616ab87c2395 “oh, he must be terribly unhappy!... he has abandoned his mother and sister.... what for?

0xe5b937046756a516270f342508862598e76d348e what did he say to her?
0x87168e5a20c957b0796651aa7acaef7ad3125c15 he had kissed her foot and said... said (yes, he had said it clearly) that he could not live without her.... oh, merciful heavens!”
0x938cd5d6c13208150d9a6d37a4f4b58a542c28c7 sonia spent the whole night feverish and delirious.
0x328115eabd4f99be5b55f77cc1b3f3f6b6fe6d3c she jumped up from time to time, wept and wrung her hands, then sank again into feverish sleep and dreamt of polenka, katerina ivanovna and lizaveta, of reading the gospel and him... him with pale face, with burning eyes... kissing her feet, weeping.
0x1e88a75210e502f6218312c76c782baf7aa16023 on the other side of the door on the right, which divided sonia’s room from madame resslich’s flat, was a room which had long stood empty.
0x113918e5c70e8894d8503afe28066d3e36e68daa a card was fixed on the gate and a notice stuck in the windows over the canal advertising it to let.
0xa7071610550f2bf5edaec5405d2a26eb7cb9c916 sonia had long been accustomed to the room’s being uninhabited.
0x1e76596ab9fe05deb289cfcffc1db3cf94c21a95 but all that time mr. svidrigaïlov had been standing, listening at the door of the empty room.
0xeced033a942da95bb01030a746428e7859e78fbd when raskolnikov went out he stood still, thought a moment, went on tiptoe to his own room which adjoined the empty one, brought a chair and noiselessly carried it to the door that led to sonia’s room.
0xdcc28abe84d732c44bbe8ef6c198d2a4ff678a3c the conversation had struck him as interesting and remarkable, and he had greatly enjoyed it--so much so that he brought a chair that he might not in the future, to-morrow, for instance, have to endure the inconvenience of standing a whole hour, but might listen in comfort.
0xd0b1ff0048f3a5d2616f1d39d9fa6b6f5cd96e60 chapter v when next morning at eleven o’clock punctually raskolnikov went into the department of the investigation of criminal causes and sent his name in to porfiry petrovitch, he was surprised at being kept waiting so long: it was at least ten minutes before he was summoned.
0x7ab36a9ef954bffe479ed281b2a6e0f0b09cacdf he had expected that they would pounce upon him.
0x9731623ca22986af34eac13cd2e8902222be01c1 but he stood in the waiting-room, and people, who apparently had nothing to do with him, were continually passing to and fro before him.
0xb2cf0042def613f05514c5f429323d07dbec3442 in the next room which looked like an office, several clerks were sitting writing and obviously they had no notion who or what raskolnikov might be.
0xa9e330ef320c99e3e66bffc7eb23811156a0192f he looked uneasily and suspiciously about him to see whether there was not some guard, some mysterious watch being kept on him to prevent his escape.
0xd9196f0a47b157e639bbab04d24e9eb1a489ae58 but there was nothing of the sort: he saw only the faces of clerks absorbed in petty details, then other people, no one seemed to have any concern with him.
0xbcfece29699fcbeea485ff6fec523219c1085e49 he might go where he liked for them.
0x66125375e5ab2cba7bdabcfa81c2a0ae19edf624 the conviction grew stronger in him that if that enigmatic man of yesterday, that phantom sprung out of the earth, had seen everything, they would not have let him stand and wait like that.
0x15330ba9e991fa70a98dbe529efbf09a83c097bf and would they have waited till he elected to appear at eleven?
0x7690192bac7d6012c4f3748887977ecab54e0a35 either the man had not yet given information, or... or simply he knew nothing, had seen nothing (and how could he have seen anything?)
0x545d2677dd7b727a28a2aa108be02449f8caf9f2 and so all that had happened to him the day before was again a phantom exaggerated by his sick and overstrained imagination.
0x2520207b28689bc0c533bfe62dd0bc50d7bab84c this conjecture had begun to grow strong the day before, in the midst of all his alarm and despair.
0x0a7a634982c1dbbbeeb29791ae54fbcc865451a4 thinking it all over now and preparing for a fresh conflict, he was suddenly aware that he was trembling--and he felt a rush of indignation at the thought that he was trembling with fear at facing that hateful porfiry petrovitch.
0x3d778db5179dfbe60f2bdce6b60168397096216b what he dreaded above all was meeting that man again; he hated him with an intense, unmitigated hatred and was afraid his hatred might betray him.
0x316eaa0ae530cdaaf0aee85a948137d62f304120 his indignation was such that he ceased trembling at once; he made ready to go in with a cold and arrogant bearing and vowed to himself to keep as silent as possible, to watch and listen and for once at least to control his overstrained nerves.
0x1199794333b8c70ea9380ce2c98e0fad5be150c7 at that moment he was summoned to porfiry petrovitch.
0x066a7cbb56847b375ad0bbe52e3d2a62477ba97a he found porfiry petrovitch alone in his study.
0xea4edb41bec94e470b80717b496b53c98aa83c77 his study was a room neither large nor small, furnished with a large writing-table, that stood before a sofa, upholstered in checked material, a bureau, a bookcase in the corner and several chairs--all government furniture, of polished yellow wood.
0xa556d32fbd01af5d40f58b2002348599fdede14d in the further wall there was a closed door, beyond it there were no doubt other rooms.
0x18f38617081ed03a5febc22066073785f9a07b4e on raskolnikov’s entrance porfiry petrovitch had at once closed the door by which he had come in and they remained alone.
0x20bdacbfc8d706f07fe5b43ee8a4d5d119add62e he met his visitor with an apparently genial and good-tempered air, and it was only after a few minutes that raskolnikov saw signs of a certain awkwardness in him, as though he had been thrown out of his reckoning or caught in something very secret.
0xb13ff6237f631f191180cf76f499568ccfdc6fa9 “ah, my dear fellow!
0xa66249316d4c060f458cb54bcaa924a523ada74a here you are... in our domain”... began porfiry, holding out both hands to him.
0x4646507e05bf2f816e1e47683d7eced9092d0221 “come, sit down, old man... or perhaps you don’t like to be called ‘my dear fellow’ and ‘old man!’--_tout court_?
0x0d9b6c3bb199ef13ee95aef250d140b83a7d3cce please don’t think it too familiar.... here, on the sofa.”
0xdc041a3209625459e1479b90ed1e442b4cd3b530 raskolnikov sat down, keeping his eyes fixed on him.
0x756814f057684370a03b0aeb950730f9c3979f05 “in our domain,” the apologies for familiarity, the french phrase _tout court_, were all characteristic signs.
0xe5e0064fcca4c3b6a36f333df51bd5cfdcd4d6dd “he held out both hands to me, but he did not give me one--he drew it back in time,” struck him suspiciously.
0xb5f7b612f7ca19f22090a421def8139b1640df3b both were watching each other, but when their eyes met, quick as lightning they looked away.
0xb7832e0a744fdaeb27ae112e07ae593ca51f3354 “i brought you this paper... about the watch.
0x471713b01489255a6dab948faf68d7c39a7e8c1b here it is.
0xc1203d417e2dfb62cd47cb36368b6ab43b9d8bd5 is it all right or shall i copy it again?”
0xd925ce5fccd34b0b9314565227fa1f35fbe7007c “what?
0xfcd64524548002fb933ead609634f6fcb0f6baa1 a paper?
0x15b489e1e4966b4d78b5c3e8f01764d40c987c86 yes, yes, don’t be uneasy, it’s all right,” porfiry petrovitch said as though in haste, and after he had said it he took the paper and looked at it.
0x003d19704965e66374b0e1dba63ec8cedd554e94 “yes, it’s all right.
0x020ea74f892ee2c8e479eaa19eaf28a4a07a84b0 nothing more is needed,” he declared with the same rapidity and he laid the paper on the table.
0xf55fac9c1e46b27478339429fb75ca5c45b84ac7 a minute later when he was talking of something else he took it from the table and put it on his bureau.
0xf10bafc483300563aedbba283a4f0631e0c4c056 “i believe you said yesterday you would like to question me... formally... about my acquaintance with the murdered woman?”
0x073f25eb8d1f7ad6983eb2d45f8d6aec288db4bd raskolnikov was beginning again.
0x78dca888ac575471bc605d340056c75a01427fc9 “why did i put in ‘i believe’” passed through his mind in a flash.
0xb997ca142e71afe3745999f1ccce5c65502aae1e “why am i so uneasy at having put in that ‘_i believe_’?”
0x43fed2892dbb33799be4e288b82872890f9a884c came in a second flash.
0xc99ad928c5224744d06aeb6ed89088a78d6fad1a and he suddenly felt that his uneasiness at the mere contact with porfiry, at the first words, at the first looks, had grown in an instant to monstrous proportions, and that this was fearfully dangerous.
0x2e60b843e1210c65057618db50de0624aee72bec his nerves were quivering, his emotion was increasing.
0x019ec1260721dd4e78a0747748391602ec5b8936 “it’s bad, it’s bad!
0x9e014c17182458ddff495d5dcb83261af38acf8e i shall say too much again.”
0xc3127145e4342e327b40a7a3254fc9bcdcb4fa6b “yes, yes, yes!
0xfc65683a17a30e32542debac0a842b4b5e9ae91a there’s no hurry, there’s no hurry,” muttered porfiry petrovitch, moving to and fro about the table without any apparent aim, as it were making dashes towards the window, the bureau and the table, at one moment avoiding raskolnikov’s suspicious glance, then again standing still and looking him straight in the face.
0xf274769cb9d3f2d93e1202d5a3ba8b97b549183a his fat round little figure looked very strange, like a ball rolling from one side to the other and rebounding back.
0xbf0e57d12ace03a158d90706627dea43b3d26c33 “we’ve plenty of time.
0xb12901ead6a914bd8d42112e9c1ae589691e53d4 do you smoke?
0xfa0b444d6eec489028af47fc11d185ecb8ff1106 have you your own?
0x3a4c8489f9075fe3b15ceb05c663cae310d47b91 here, a cigarette!”
0x7e30accc9dfaf4efce4275ad0b9fba8306cb38eb he went on, offering his visitor a cigarette.
0x43ed1df3c9108f20a85386d3ea16cfd0f90df6e1 “you know i am receiving you here, but my own quarters are through there, you know, my government quarters.
0x85520a0cf9625b6d028984860e81284e8b8266ed but i am living outside for the time, i had to have some repairs done here.
0x2dc67ff2683ee8b7e4b5e7d3640f3683ad58dea6 it’s almost finished now.... government quarters, you know, are a capital thing.
0x85d4eec16153621c4a0d6527aa10d065140b67e6 eh, what do you think?”
0x31f1fb9598f316877912866396193906d5f39f9f “yes, a capital thing,” answered raskolnikov, looking at him almost ironically.
0xb55e17e5b13dd3aed26a342764b232a7c7d330e3 “a capital thing, a capital thing,” repeated porfiry petrovitch, as though he had just thought of something quite different.
0x680ba5856c81f2275fefd9eb29051496db4fb5f8 “yes, a capital thing,” he almost shouted at last, suddenly staring at raskolnikov and stopping short two steps from him.
0x33e6114614546b02e9cf1298a22c7a82ce470402 this stupid repetition was too incongruous in its ineptitude with the serious, brooding and enigmatic glance he turned upon his visitor.
0x80efbdcd2b3bd3247ba4d700f7e6ed6a12b0d123 but this stirred raskolnikov’s spleen more than ever and he could not resist an ironical and rather incautious challenge.
0xfe8c9513347ae9a35f3bf7d9297189dd2ebd6310 “tell me, please,” he asked suddenly, looking almost insolently at him and taking a kind of pleasure in his own insolence.
0x8dd0b20ead4675b3dbc648d9ba7596c1f8dc2434 “i believe it’s a sort of legal rule, a sort of legal tradition--for all investigating lawyers--to begin their attack from afar, with a trivial, or at least an irrelevant subject, so as to encourage, or rather, to divert the man they are cross-examining, to disarm his caution and then all at once to give him an unexpected knock-down blow with some fatal question.
0x9e2a95a984ea353cee2ee3db004ecb7512dd0b27 isn’t that so?
0x091de31ce049c69e518874d06e4a9b3eb22b1d89 it’s a sacred tradition, mentioned, i fancy, in all the manuals of the art?”
0x07a340b03e2517944f85b9ca3049de8444269d74 “yes, yes.... why, do you imagine that was why i spoke about government quarters... eh?”
0xbedf63d036019f1b13e1c9dbac24e112646596ee and as he said this porfiry petrovitch screwed up his eyes and winked; a good-humoured, crafty look passed over his face.
0x10723232fe70052a1acda674786e7e09a21f87fd the wrinkles on his forehead were smoothed out, his eyes contracted, his features broadened and he suddenly went off into a nervous prolonged laugh, shaking all over and looking raskolnikov straight in the face.
0xf10754ae33a70b1c0cb220e4ae1ac80ec06496d6 the latter forced himself to laugh, too, but when porfiry, seeing that he was laughing, broke into such a guffaw that he turned almost crimson, raskolnikov’s repulsion overcame all precaution; he left off laughing, scowled and stared with hatred at porfiry, keeping his eyes fixed on him while his intentionally prolonged laughter lasted.
0xa9a183bb1080cd13f06563ec5d1931ea38899353 there was lack of precaution on both sides, however, for porfiry petrovitch seemed to be laughing in his visitor’s face and to be very little disturbed at the annoyance with which the visitor received it.
0x7096e6b4dc8c8fb0bcffd45944cdce1e10895589 the latter fact was very significant in raskolnikov’s eyes: he saw that porfiry petrovitch had not been embarrassed just before either, but that he, raskolnikov, had perhaps fallen into a trap; that there must be something, some motive here unknown to him; that, perhaps, everything was in readiness and in another moment would break upon him... he went straight to the point at once, rose from his seat and took his cap.
0x470111d8b38057c0e2c878142ab48691e6bdebf5 “porfiry petrovitch,” he began resolutely, though with considerable irritation, “yesterday you expressed a desire that i should come to you for some inquiries” (he laid special stress on the word “inquiries”).
0x729b7aeb73edaae90311580ca2c368399b8fbde7 “i have come and if you have anything to ask me, ask it, and if not, allow me to withdraw.
0x2be1f6fac9bc99058ae2c840bc1769445bffc129 i have no time to spare.... i have to be at the funeral of that man who was run over, of whom you... know also,” he added, feeling angry at once at having made this addition and more irritated at his anger.
0x830418c225ba53b27d2f12c88f79de0ded3ccf99 “i am sick of it all, do you hear?
0x68be5cd8a7b912a07a6a1a995a53f032391175d2 and have long been.
0x86230f2f82afbfb37e52da43683032f9f7413004 it’s partly what made me ill. in short,” he shouted, feeling that the phrase about his illness was still more out of place, “in short, kindly examine me or let me go, at once.
0x8dcaf2cec5eab6c582e90cde417851d45a2f86dc and if you must examine me, do so in the proper form!
0x400ed32e8791863ab9fd43f72273b7be8704def4 i will not allow you to do so otherwise, and so meanwhile, good-bye, as we have evidently nothing to keep us now.”
0x30b4b680a4068d82e915c51a0631bf04e40c8078 “good heavens!
0x7cf5cb90f64d4c513b3fa482057f80ab3bbc685f what do you mean?
0xe22690bcf0d0770e2feedb8a4a1ce3ae77ee1fbb what shall i question you about?”
0x7be86a660e83e70d8d5536b2e809d66eb5bd0a63 cackled porfiry petrovitch with a change of tone, instantly leaving off laughing.
0xd7d8ffc8accae34c3622f57a9c6a69577d6a8262 “please don’t disturb yourself,” he began fidgeting from place to place and fussily making raskolnikov sit down.
0x9a91e0ae248f3bc794924c222fc27bd074bec4c7 “there’s no hurry, there’s no hurry, it’s all nonsense.
0x368874255056569d07f17c063fa9a11a94b5e35d oh, no, i’m very glad you’ve come to see me at last... i look upon you simply as a visitor.
0x31f7ba37c5932aef580606efd8524a2334fb5e49 and as for my confounded laughter, please excuse it, rodion romanovitch.
0xee500511394fcb34422845d7283ad538b67c50ed rodion romanovitch?
0x0d79294b75a822c7a9db964224ae4c6a7af91224 that is your name?... it’s my nerves, you tickled me so with your witty observation; i assure you, sometimes i shake with laughter like an india-rubber ball for half an hour at a time.... i’m often afraid of an attack of paralysis.
0xa5703cd8baa77737b93185989c01804f2074e1e5 do sit down.
0xa6f3cd790b333293e2fc3ef6cd6a2ea3da230d34 please do, or i shall think you are angry...” raskolnikov did not speak; he listened, watching him, still frowning angrily.
0x097c623ae23def30332e4838eedd1d4c4bfdfb7f he did sit down, but still held his cap.
0x76ecd0131abfd5d22216a26182aee91c6924e7d5 “i must tell you one thing about myself, my dear rodion romanovitch,” porfiry petrovitch continued, moving about the room and again avoiding his visitor’s eyes.
0xaa62145495b850767e53bf2639d195038a58e688 “you see, i’m a bachelor, a man of no consequence and not used to society; besides, i have nothing before me, i’m set, i’m running to seed and... and have you noticed, rodion romanovitch, that in our petersburg circles, if two clever men meet who are not intimate, but respect each other, like you and me, it takes them half an hour before they can find a subject for conversation--they are dumb, they sit opposite each other and feel awkward.
0xc974345ca20627b70b6975b275055a4ccd8609dd everyone has subjects of conversation, ladies for instance... people in high society always have their subjects of conversation, _c’est de rigueur_, but people of the middle sort like us, thinking people that is, are always tongue-tied and awkward.
0x8a34facc5df8b5bd04f2e55aef8f10b8bd38926e what is the reason of it?
0x58d6dda139f076144d224388d6504a5a13a7a3b7 whether it is the lack of public interest, or whether it is we are so honest we don’t want to deceive one another, i don’t know.
0xb701e245e0265c11b571739988b7f4f2f4f9389a what do you think?
0x38bea36b083271c706783c917774c017013507a7 do put down your cap, it looks as if you were just going, it makes me uncomfortable... i am so delighted...” raskolnikov put down his cap and continued listening in silence with a serious frowning face to the vague and empty chatter of porfiry petrovitch.
0x6c16a371de908e0f9f62e15baff94676a42a4aa9 “does he really want to distract my attention with his silly babble?”
0xfc7a83dfaebf5b50a8832b3edee7cc770c18b101 “i can’t offer you coffee here; but why not spend five minutes with a friend?”
0x88d5d2fe2554e8be2bfc907ded12ef2cad5fb2e3 porfiry pattered on, “and you know all these official duties... please don’t mind my running up and down, excuse it, my dear fellow, i am very much afraid of offending you, but exercise is absolutely indispensable for me.
0xa537f7d5327f0c20e5eb1179da6f0d6c44187b4d i’m always sitting and so glad to be moving about for five minutes... i suffer from my sedentary life... i always intend to join a gymnasium; they say that officials of all ranks, even privy councillors, may be seen skipping gaily there; there you have it, modern science... yes, yes.... but as for my duties here, inquiries and all such formalities... you mentioned inquiries yourself just now... i assure you these interrogations are sometimes more embarrassing for the interrogator than for the interrogated.... you made the observation yourself just now very aptly and wittily.”
0x691dec772b4e9e02511c4d17e8a1d20872baa0e4 (raskolnikov had made no observation of the kind.)
0x7f911c3d3f9a262c34ad1a240adb038543d50ba3 “one gets into a muddle!
0x467dafdf53fce7ea1be20bd4c11b8bb054b287f9 a regular muddle!
0x351eb902437b3e26403de1bd17a2352d8c444492 one keeps harping on the same note, like a drum!
0xdc94fc3cfa25c3d66abfbe9744b443892d0b0c2b there is to be a reform and we shall be called by a different name, at least, he-he-he!
0x70dbc154db65447178e12959058123c430340569 and as for our legal tradition, as you so wittily called it, i thoroughly agree with you.
0x314ec8b08a257806bf5a87b4574c8e9d2d3af5d6 every prisoner on trial, even the rudest peasant, knows that they begin by disarming him with irrelevant questions (as you so happily put it) and then deal him a knock-down blow, he-he-he!--your felicitous comparison, he-he!
0xa81c347d10cb00ebc6dfb14d068a88215f008e65 so you really imagined that i meant by ‘government quarters’... he-he!
0x65cbaab55d797cafb3074192c01206f2c6ea7df0 you are an ironical person.
0x7269686648c69dd1e944023b70c4fc09fa24f94f come.
0x78a05e7ec3beada0b96ef208e493ee9ccccc575b i won’t go on!
0x030ef1fd14b0b0dc263400c0d9f41e94553c8a93 ah, by the way, yes!
0x8b4cd7c3a25dbab807c6274e517c1127a96704c2 one word leads to another.
0x5f172eabb287347a3d3bff2f23c803dd0585ffda you spoke of formality just now, apropos of the inquiry, you know.
0x09e9df474074f531afbca0b85cb068e13cfb3dc1 but what’s the use of formality?
0xd0aaf13145ac7280c2ad09ea9e3ed755f5bae96d in many cases it’s nonsense.
0x9cbd47af8991bd206d720a64ac789024e6e5248f sometimes one has a friendly chat and gets a good deal more out of it.
0x93df54144f6135e5923b405b8e60a716474e5ea4 one can always fall back on formality, allow me to assure you.
0x449038574f2b73b324698eba85d44cbd5f809495 and after all, what does it amount to?
0xa06d19e5c4f9ef11ee9f74edfb5e07c3c531b570 an examining lawyer cannot be bounded by formality at every step.
0x05a6e24b29b0f6fe2741c669b960c707d829f6e0 the work of investigation is, so to speak, a free art in its own way, he-he-he!”
0x3515d533ca353cdf47e06518d6d0db3a69b2e322 porfiry petrovitch took breath a moment.
0x837f5b400c764c4bf6f2b414d88787a0df289c31 he had simply babbled on uttering empty phrases, letting slip a few enigmatic words and again reverting to incoherence.
0xfd8e65b3317b557aed4476f8784645f65a545aea he was almost running about the room, moving his fat little legs quicker and quicker, looking at the ground, with his right hand behind his back, while with his left making gesticulations that were extraordinarily incongruous with his words.
0xd58e306916d212b2aba67d0dec880632178538fe raskolnikov suddenly noticed that as he ran about the room he seemed twice to stop for a moment near the door, as though he were listening.
0x4a1e8b9601236b06ed5032b6e82dfa4f63924ce7 “is he expecting anything?”
0x6fe6be52edcca07bf34ada673587cad6aa536a98 “you are certainly quite right about it,” porfiry began gaily, looking with extraordinary simplicity at raskolnikov (which startled him and instantly put him on his guard); “certainly quite right in laughing so wittily at our legal forms, he-he!
0x5ee0f1fa452143ebb0d6b9bcbdbdcf53c4ba24f2 some of these elaborate psychological methods are exceedingly ridiculous and perhaps useless, if one adheres too closely to the forms.

0x716184ee8a58afa36bbc16b1d16d908360727c13 well, if i recognise, or more strictly speaking, if i suspect someone or other to be a criminal in any case entrusted to me... you’re reading for the law, of course, rodion romanovitch?”
0x49192427abc4d5958f9c7a9ee64e808722d1d18f “yes, i was...” “well, then it is a precedent for you for the future--though don’t suppose i should venture to instruct you after the articles you publish about crime!
0xdf7b2ed97a98bc5fbd0cc299ee3898b8c3e19cf8 no, i simply make bold to state it by way of fact, if i took this man or that for a criminal, why, i ask, should i worry him prematurely, even though i had evidence against him?
0x55fc3a0ca3a36235c7223cf126be83a025e53465 in one case i may be bound, for instance, to arrest a man at once, but another may be in quite a different position, you know, so why shouldn’t i let him walk about the town a bit?
0x257c3f8129ecf12d3d8dfeee379e9c6d4708a00e he-he-he!
0xdc27bf58366493c659988ca858a86d71cf20be68 but i see you don’t quite understand, so i’ll give you a clearer example.
0x972fdff4037bed7471a938f20f4890df1a69aa76 if i put him in prison too soon, i may very likely give him, so to speak, moral support, he-he!
0xdc9329582d2c7640426e3712c75a2baea9a95d1b you’re laughing?”
0x9b10fa94993adbcd40642c2556b579142173cd35 raskolnikov had no idea of laughing.
0xff5ce699531e69fde5033a648ce29bd1c58eecb5 he was sitting with compressed lips, his feverish eyes fixed on porfiry petrovitch’s.
0x8424fd68c856cc1d18d8135a11555c4eff7bd137 “yet that is the case, with some types especially, for men are so different.
0x95e4fbb8c12757435e901f79b9bb193c8bf9a6ab you say ‘evidence’.
0xe85ed911a3ecb0bce8ea16f1c9dbaea851a11e95 well, there may be evidence.
0xb2b0d3e434612ee981672f45074a2103a3633cf1 but evidence, you know, can generally be taken two ways.
0xc3e76703a3937b48a6eda045909339f32f19ee25 i am an examining lawyer and a weak man, i confess it.
0x73bcc9df24368303ceb81a3a7643ea666fc0a5ed i should like to make a proof, so to say, mathematically clear.
0x26693ef5b85dfc5948a24a45f175685f8c81649b i should like to make a chain of evidence such as twice two are four, it ought to be a direct, irrefutable proof!
0x3fa87bfa4e04c10c47f7fd815c7c7fbeb043db15 and if i shut him up too soon--even though i might be convinced _he_ was the man, i should very likely be depriving myself of the means of getting further evidence against him.
0x9d1d2208b76568cd87c1f10ea35166f10027622b and how?
0x33f700eda4c69eac536ed7fc61254ce563d7f6b8 by giving him, so to speak, a definite position, i shall put him out of suspense and set his mind at rest, so that he will retreat into his shell.
0x23a94e4891914357274b31302207f29b6bf20dbb they say that at sevastopol, soon after alma, the clever people were in a terrible fright that the enemy would attack openly and take sevastopol at once.
0x5ac78f72efe923c870c510bad648c9c11843dc8e but when they saw that the enemy preferred a regular siege, they were delighted, i am told and reassured, for the thing would drag on for two months at least.
0xce29edba0ecb3962c66b62b67b40d6ae7f6944f6 you’re laughing, you don’t believe me again?
0x597adcec6d843c82b10e75652fdccc25a992d6ab of course, you’re right, too.
0xf33f216d52f481dc1f08bad1105c36dbfdd6fe69 you’re right, you’re right.
0x674ebf6af393020f09ecf981d3c8e704be69d62f these are special cases, i admit.
0x7fb63a46c79ab6ef3d524a8e51c84729651fc43d but you must observe this, my dear rodion romanovitch, the general case, the case for which all legal forms and rules are intended, for which they are calculated and laid down in books, does not exist at all, for the reason that every case, every crime, for instance, so soon as it actually occurs, at once becomes a thoroughly special case and sometimes a case unlike any that’s gone before.
0xf887c53a528c1a38639718a79170e8c29c26857e very comic cases of that sort sometimes occur.
0xaca3900eda45f0944f210ccc2f72d1553243e9bf if i leave one man quite alone, if i don’t touch him and don’t worry him, but let him know or at least suspect every moment that i know all about it and am watching him day and night, and if he is in continual suspicion and terror, he’ll be bound to lose his head.
0x6691ed210e6f2a89a80f764e9e884983ba9ba69a he’ll come of himself, or maybe do something which will make it as plain as twice two are four--it’s delightful.
0x2589a2d2a69a0121f36e8f0e7f43f5ebd1d2b42e it may be so with a simple peasant, but with one of our sort, an intelligent man cultivated on a certain side, it’s a dead certainty.
0xe2376a059878ad60924e5e604ebd6c3ce87f0b0b for, my dear fellow, it’s a very important matter to know on what side a man is cultivated.
0x65b940b4968462a907b75f8811c3c0028e471830 and then there are nerves, there are nerves, you have overlooked them!
0xe722be0b97e12e48953bae82d57fd285d62e7bb5 why, they are all sick, nervous and irritable!... and then how they all suffer from spleen!
0x6643df1bccd1dad512fc7ee6a3cce9a2e9c7df48 that i assure you is a regular gold-mine for us.
0xa00913777e17adb14a8353039c50482e51ae9267 and it’s no anxiety to me, his running about the town free!
0x8683731f05889b9afacd4324d44cd281100045dd let him, let him walk about for a bit!
0xcdf3444fd6635303d77f5c2c1f1d77b263c94229 i know well enough that i’ve caught him and that he won’t escape me.
0x4250b4b424eb268c0c4a0a3ee61fa332db906ac5 where could he escape to, he-he?
0xec5ca558df060fd0fd6644af9aa4c938c9bbca36 abroad, perhaps?
0x20d34400a50c058d274b5eb3deba39a1b4e92f36 a pole will escape abroad, but not here, especially as i am watching and have taken measures.
0x13cd1fd55b78a29751581a7e88eddf05ad53d55c will he escape into the depths of the country perhaps?
0xb3a841b4cc2337ee57bcf0bedd33a74edd62ebad but you know, peasants live there, real rude russian peasants.
0xc5e0c07175714b70639b12f8933e0815d055bf40 a modern cultivated man would prefer prison to living with such strangers as our peasants.
0xbaf7f48ca36d1d539d995427803e221f5b97c360 he-he!
0x352bc9bf2d7d46d692baf5fa60b465522d580bf9 but that’s all nonsense, and on the surface.
0x820a99d5498b0ba25ed4414aa702be91f4b910a3 it’s not merely that he has nowhere to run to, he is _psychologically_ unable to escape me, he-he!
0x1721c69a4867494be25ee1ef78063f45dd29ad12 what an expression!
0xa6e4037546f1d4930f0c8571e63be88ff98dfe1e through a law of nature he can’t escape me if he had anywhere to go.
0x3640bda028fc38f8447d52ee8ae89a6cf174c25f have you seen a butterfly round a candle?
0xf5f9bc21b08ed8d91f230fb969a7898d31a2f05b that’s how he will keep circling and circling round me.
0x2adafff3ca3957afb9ab4e5aa8627ff500a720c2 freedom will lose its attractions.
0x7011907b738db23317dba884feda5ed3fe1a4a16 he’ll begin to brood, he’ll weave a tangle round himself, he’ll worry himself to death!
0x5b57112a782a818f02d37116048800b46db60851 what’s more he will provide me with a mathematical proof--if i only give him long enough interval.... and he’ll keep circling round me, getting nearer and nearer and then--flop!
0xde3dca2265d620c5518ca075627bf53014dd1803 he’ll fly straight into my mouth and i’ll swallow him, and that will be very amusing, he-he-he!
0x665654d47218c269c1e02b742853e4b17cc86935 you don’t believe me?”
0x4edb9e3a848983b1adb6d80319dfe88dd0ef44fc raskolnikov made no reply; he sat pale and motionless, still gazing with the same intensity into porfiry’s face.
0x3dbc7a339682daccbd3a064f92abd1ba41c53729 “it’s a lesson,” he thought, turning cold.
0x182269256789d487399cb39c0350903403ea0e07 “this is beyond the cat playing with a mouse, like yesterday.
0x6f70717a4281f38c096a1f16cdb0a3ca2430c126 he can’t be showing off his power with no motive... prompting me; he is far too clever for that... he must have another object.
0x192bbbf8f992093f23a9107ca8775d4f4c135a38 what is it?
0x60841e07c04a7ee59deda2fdd8518e94d9dd190d it’s all nonsense, my friend, you are pretending, to scare me!
0xf09770f8645179ffd16b19242fc4bb6e82b71341 you’ve no proofs and the man i saw had no real existence.
0xe45acfc6b5096963bf302a545088f6cfef823fd2 you simply want to make me lose my head, to work me up beforehand and so to crush me.
0x33cec0ddb9164b713887e16061da74753874cd8a but you are wrong, you won’t do it!

0x251ad7c2b2e5ff99289146fd34361836ae3be6ec no, my friend, you are wrong, you won’t do it even though you have some trap for me... let us see what you have in store for me.”
0xd3ce4d2b893d17ab90df1bd91ffbff73d0a684bb and he braced himself to face a terrible and unknown ordeal.
0x6b5309733369ed11d87c57c55b15b2154ede6613 at times he longed to fall on porfiry and strangle him.
0x8861f9e8b4181ec189bf7160c01eb10abc57e515 this anger was what he dreaded from the beginning.
0x2bdd1fb6fcab98f4cb554beb3d985a1fe64530e7 he felt that his parched lips were flecked with foam, his heart was throbbing.
0x01426ae7f4fdeb8b399e297286a105aa21cc42ff but he was still determined not to speak till the right moment.
0x08d1f6d52bd7b593d95a9649d6686c1337c52f67 he realised that this was the best policy in his position, because instead of saying too much he would be irritating his enemy by his silence and provoking him into speaking too freely.
0x318213e898cc9e6ec6568f4e977420e451aa43eb anyhow, this was what he hoped for.
0x1cb156beef3b3744d3fe1679f22b02c06cd34a12 “no, i see you don’t believe me, you think i am playing a harmless joke on you,” porfiry began again, getting more and more lively, chuckling at every instant and again pacing round the room.
0x3348433800a1ea014d332461c099701ec78debee “and to be sure you’re right: god has given me a figure that can awaken none but comic ideas in other people; a buffoon; but let me tell you, and i repeat it, excuse an old man, my dear rodion romanovitch, you are a man still young, so to say, in your first youth and so you put intellect above everything, like all young people.
0xba556da57b87eda98529b045ae0a4e61b531eba5 playful wit and abstract arguments fascinate you and that’s for all the world like the old austrian _hof-kriegsrath_, as far as i can judge of military matters, that is: on paper they’d beaten napoleon and taken him prisoner, and there in their study they worked it all out in the cleverest fashion, but look you, general mack surrendered with all his army, he-he-he!
0x9c0d24506eb7d716f24cf9fc8d10e0f56616bbc9 i see, i see, rodion romanovitch, you are laughing at a civilian like me, taking examples out of military history!
0x21150bb31093899e648add6ad7fcacf2952eaae1 but i can’t help it, it’s my weakness.

0x35b74669e079929103668cb3434ff2f9d0d5d153 i’ve certainly missed my proper career.
0x8550225f0bcc89b050667e56f7cf9cdd69677f67 i ought to have been in the army, upon my word i ought.
0x41082f0ccc4b753ec684b4af7d4c6a0c6b077abd i shouldn’t have been a napoleon, but i might have been a major, he-he!
0x3a5c0103cb6b656763e005d3116610b58b7215c4 well, i’ll tell you the whole truth, my dear fellow, about this _special case_, i mean: actual fact and a man’s temperament, my dear sir, are weighty matters and it’s astonishing how they sometimes deceive the sharpest calculation!
0xad9014c81feeb443be66d1e2942793c688501589 i--listen to an old man--am speaking seriously, rodion romanovitch” (as he said this porfiry petrovitch, who was scarcely five-and-thirty, actually seemed to have grown old; even his voice changed and he seemed to shrink together) “moreover, i’m a candid man... am i a candid man or not?
0x73319c406b09ddd43cef4336649d563a33e11bd5 what do you say?

0x3fddd5db8cf0ebde091482b6e3980435eab4beac well, to proceed, wit in my opinion is a splendid thing, it is, so to say, an adornment of nature and a consolation of life, and what tricks it can play!
0x3598df73fbeeb1ca7701d119b4efa9a859a3dd9e so that it sometimes is hard for a poor examining lawyer to know where he is, especially when he’s liable to be carried away by his own fancy, too, for you know he is a man after all!
0xb7330434661facb417dbdb6dea8e52b0cb6d87a7 but the poor fellow is saved by the criminal’s temperament, worse luck for him!
0xe75161e2c454257c6d79708d2cc7521e33653114 but young people carried away by their own wit don’t think of that ‘when they overstep all obstacles,’ as you wittily and cleverly expressed it yesterday.
0x9ff9d4f50c369120baec5312cd763a888540a56f he will lie--that is, the man who is a _special case_, the incognito, and he will lie well, in the cleverest fashion; you might think he would triumph and enjoy the fruits of his wit, but at the most interesting, the most flagrant moment he will faint.
0xcab5629276c07d3026d02de3de339a1ed5a6418c of course there may be illness and a stuffy room as well, but anyway!
0x5b6ecae720e3e95efd3da463dc3221fffe022b85 anyway he’s given us the idea!
0x699b3c465b24655a3d158a02ea84513fc25e991b he lied incomparably, but he didn’t reckon on his temperament.
0x4ff2f83829937563278e8fb11c37e949e7807d11 that’s what betrays him!
0xff4f43eabb7c6d8bc280d4738219ea1e81a5b7c0 another time he will be carried away by his playful wit into making fun of the man who suspects him, he will turn pale as it were on purpose to mislead, but his paleness will be _too natural_, too much like the real thing, again he has given us an idea!
0x9edb94027ff3d19db82b4b2a1752ef251d0d6783 though his questioner may be deceived at first, he will think differently next day if he is not a fool, and, of course, it is like that at every step!
0xb4c88fc655f2465e5a19935b5ce77b5a47ff56a2 he puts himself forward where he is not wanted, speaks continually when he ought to keep silent, brings in all sorts of allegorical allusions, he-he!
0x07e9b2f99b00bb23c21ab6ef4edeec62589ee211 comes and asks why didn’t you take me long ago?

0x48269c0984eb77fa548d7bf470198e2c9dc1ee8d and that can happen, you know, with the cleverest man, the psychologist, the literary man.
0x5a17fa5381927d0eb24f86a129039edea3dae85f the temperament reflects everything like a mirror!

0x051c6a0838eec68822c7280d5c76c29844b72539 but why are you so pale, rodion romanovitch?
0x1964812f7fc5996d5292f96e3a84c8eead55e0d7 is the room stuffy?

0xa3b7bb55a04c9530f7efeb2f0ad8fb78db48f6e7 “oh, don’t trouble, please,” cried raskolnikov and he suddenly broke into a laugh.

0x3dec0c860050ee43d2227822706120ff08c5d96a porfiry stood facing him, paused a moment and suddenly he too laughed.
0x054a869d6f71084409f7de7f456665a6216674c3 raskolnikov got up from the sofa, abruptly checking his hysterical laughter.
0x3d65cb086523cc0d1d71ea19e73fc48b33612b13 “porfiry petrovitch,” he began, speaking loudly and distinctly, though his legs trembled and he could scarcely stand.

0x9670094db01c7f1906a7ca6f4e469eed66ad16e7 and you must have some water, my dear fellow.
0x8a829bdc4e1acb38d1c6c9e91b28cd326083684b you’re ill!”
0xc4c4340d730ad4ea8380e17e6b2d1df94f8e5261 and he was running to the door to call for some when he found a decanter of water in the corner.
0x458446b0964f5eb05d31ceac8778829c6c15df88 “come, drink a little,” he whispered, rushing up to him with the decanter.
0x78ae2a20c223ea1ac6370fab80dc5d630cd77f15 “it will be sure to do you good.”
0x803711bce1499bf9e276740fab862eaf483c8664 porfiry petrovitch’s alarm and sympathy were so natural that raskolnikov was silent and began looking at him with wild curiosity.
0x623323a3847afebf900f93740ed797abf02b570f he did not take the water, however.
0x9939bf823e3a23ea92e35bf82f11923e75a42e34 “rodion romanovitch, my dear fellow, you’ll drive yourself out of your mind, i assure you, ach, ach!
0x11834d44c263d4ebd8c6d709d67c575ec922df56 have some water, do drink a little.”
0x8812fbdd21001dcc4c1df13e8ff2aa8e89b517d3 he forced him to take the glass.
0x3b004e557f457bc432e8249284168276c34463fc raskolnikov raised it mechanically to his lips, but set it on the table again with disgust.
0xc7ba9c345f09dabf08618303072eee1af8bfe67e “yes, you’ve had a little attack!
0x6932160d7c7c10780b7c776c5abbaae089e1194a you’ll bring back your illness again, my dear fellow,” porfiry petrovitch cackled with friendly sympathy, though he still looked rather disconcerted.
0x48d5cae46597667b9d7e744758232e6a792ae7d8 “good heavens, you must take more care of yourself!
0xc75b6488e6185e6c2da89752031d5914e1a1c6db dmitri prokofitch was here, came to see me yesterday--i know, i know, i’ve a nasty, ironical temper, but what they made of it!... good heavens, he came yesterday after you’d been.
0x4cc78ea07ef701cbf86f4e5011af20a26240ded1 we dined and he talked and talked away, and i could only throw up my hands in despair!
0x1ac122369d6fc5731ac89385247b616d3245eba4 did he come from you?
0x1c289c38ece6e20192447c352ef5435082ff3ca3 but do sit down, for mercy’s sake, sit down!”
0x4e27a4d58737be5eeaabb2588b1d2a15f20d507c “no, not from me, but i knew he went to you and why he went,” raskolnikov answered sharply.
0x7faa6c03755b8106ca9768b1bd0abbcbac9c7920 “you knew?”
0x4e07bc0244b9583b889ef52d171d5be8c4934caa “i knew.
0xc0b4d36b58c3506c71428c9aa8e98613c88e18d0 what of it?”
0x14fe5f67a8d473de2f3a62bee2431a5fe3020eb8 “why this, rodion romanovitch, that i know more than that about you; i know about everything.
0x90a34ea87b746af88c9414964f0d3139e951fceb i know how you went _to take a flat_ at night when it was dark and how you rang the bell and asked about the blood, so that the workmen and the porter did not know what to make of it.
0xec2ed7175beead197f6cb489a58b09b474f68822 yes, i understand your state of mind at that time... but you’ll drive yourself mad like that, upon my word!
0x6c6643c9a2e5531ce66f92e31368c6045fd00a0f you’ll lose your head!
0x475b780ddedfed2a2fb531093425bb2173c63f38 you’re full of generous indignation at the wrongs you’ve received, first from destiny, and then from the police officers, and so you rush from one thing to another to force them to speak out and make an end of it all, because you are sick of all this suspicion and foolishness.
0x3dc31256047aca409aac22642a49ab79f4b2c300 that’s so, isn’t it?
0x13ed2440c89300119c91d48f24b65b5fdc133181 i have guessed how you feel, haven’t i?
0x0f7bd53db0b0e789385a0907484e480aff70c9c0 only in that way you’ll lose your head and razumihin’s, too; he’s too _good_ a man for such a position, you must know that.
0xdc61f0c00f5a354246042eb0014b96fc578c437a you are ill and he is good and your illness is infectious for him... i’ll tell you about it when you are more yourself.... but do sit down, for goodness’ sake.
0x9c3191c1e701ce612bfe9922af100fa7ad1fdfde please rest, you look shocking, do sit down.”
0x731c84075910e4ba5af82df63d6225d817f8ea6d raskolnikov sat down; he no longer shivered, he was hot all over.
0x31f223d951ec9ee22973537c7b0a26f1009a0be2 in amazement he listened with strained attention to porfiry petrovitch who still seemed frightened as he looked after him with friendly solicitude.
0x6b10acfac5858ad1f52c0cb65dde16da89f2b1de but he did not believe a word he said, though he felt a strange inclination to believe.
0x43594d2b1aed03ae39f424f0a5cacd34b7ca2b3e porfiry’s unexpected words about the flat had utterly overwhelmed him.
0xb9d815ae23ebb65e8b2f480943fab4fa7d29c7bd “how can it be, he knows about the flat then,” he thought suddenly, “and he tells it me himself!”
0x7f6e2edf52a0e9fc10d1d2c63551ea5bdee65ec3 “yes, in our legal practice there was a case almost exactly similar, a case of morbid psychology,” porfiry went on quickly.
0x2026bc0c8cc6785af73452c37079d06591faa326 “a man confessed to murder and how he kept it up!
0xb7d148bb1c779aca014cee79f10888ac308884c5 it was a regular hallucination; he brought forward facts, he imposed upon everyone and why?
0x098c08fd570aee7a06401bfa4c3a2bdbda92748e he had been partly, but only partly, unintentionally the cause of a murder and when he knew that he had given the murderers the opportunity, he sank into dejection, it got on his mind and turned his brain, he began imagining things and he persuaded himself that he was the murderer.
0x3e72955f7152b443509b527a9015c106adc4fa9b but at last the high court of appeal went into it and the poor fellow was acquitted and put under proper care.
0x6c4c1d7b6e96da0e2ca90b12206462a41a5f51c7 thanks to the court of appeal!
0xa957086efa57633a1e9a08436676e4007eec3b13 tut-tut-tut!
0x461e1eb607c99b80cb3e8d5dad908490ddac2a0e why, my dear fellow, you may drive yourself into delirium if you have the impulse to work upon your nerves, to go ringing bells at night and asking about blood!
0x061886791f5ddeb8c03cd60b5d06487cc42611f3 i’ve studied all this morbid psychology in my practice.
0x8483f3bcb5c2b38c3a89dea95a00b5724fc14bbc a man is sometimes tempted to jump out of a window or from a belfry.
0x74814837a3a5cd9e561124a79db05c1938c370bb just the same with bell-ringing.... it’s all illness, rodion romanovitch!
0xb2c22c830467116755066d613baa3400bbe286d2 you have begun to neglect your illness.
0x7f4dc3b6f4a412fb9e337f3ee3aa3c0762bd0b54 you should consult an experienced doctor, what’s the good of that fat fellow?
0x128852f90dba7eb3544019508776342e5c33a00f you are lightheaded!
0x2547179676b8b06d5c951ead51ae1563a5234d3e you were delirious when you did all this!”
0x85be7744138e3b4bf771fabc777a2ce0f320c12d for a moment raskolnikov felt everything going round.
0x06b1692f7f0036735252cb3c30336982bae4ea5a “is it possible, is it possible,” flashed through his mind, “that he is still lying?
0x9c2b1dd5ca80ebb4221086d52c4b7cf6f3bbf2f3 he can’t be, he can’t be.”
0x7c1a6e8dc5894ba38d0dd63b395059c5afc9e5a2 he rejected that idea, feeling to what a degree of fury it might drive him, feeling that that fury might drive him mad.
0x73c2b1a17edd23c06d72f55ed5fb22a3ed0ae526 “i was not delirious.
0xedc126576b445af721152036f521b75e9bb17644 i knew what i was doing,” he cried, straining every faculty to penetrate porfiry’s game, “i was quite myself, do you hear?”
0xd299cc53d90c5da992ac3f67af34ee1c672684d6 “yes, i hear and understand.
0x27f9df5f42bc6f0c15c7383994215c716bbafe9a you said yesterday you were not delirious, you were particularly emphatic about it!
0xe0c7e91483ee03bfb766b5efae49b9111f69adb5 i understand all you can tell me!
0x812e20d67eb649e67d055ee82b300d6528c356a3 a-ach!... listen, rodion romanovitch, my dear fellow.
0x5039440ea675f8ebff85db0014cca6bbb1a91e46 if you were actually a criminal, or were somehow mixed up in this damnable business, would you insist that you were not delirious but in full possession of your faculties?
0x22f59083f4d646900f3494ea909228a51bc80e35 and so emphatically and persistently?
0x0c90281fc58c9a8986614dde822babb059648291 would it be possible?
0xfdce751df1f97d183c06c735a1f1d2497ed422e2 quite impossible, to my thinking.
0xf35b41c8a6660e25ac437b42ec159bfcb7ecb3c5 if you had anything on your conscience, you certainly ought to insist that you were delirious.
0xeb7e44eb9be7fcddebcac83a3e6377aabf72dc17 that’s so, isn’t it?”
0xd958ef0d6c52527190b43a33e7beae85f1981e4b there was a note of slyness in this inquiry.
0x76b4abb4d80ebe2d6759032d44eeb4cbb6a8cfe8 raskolnikov drew back on the sofa as porfiry bent over him and stared in silent perplexity at him.
0xaf94fe137bfeda1e3844a128e08f3ab9ed81c909 “another thing about razumihin--you certainly ought to have said that he came of his own accord, to have concealed your part in it!
0x42c6d6ee5b312ad2e1b45c7978438f0c40744ea0 but you don’t conceal it!
0xe1d1a7e2ab7afb2930441fb65dd1cbfcc277edfb you lay stress on his coming at your instigation.”
0x7248c0ee50d6df16430627cef66808bdbbd095f3 raskolnikov had not done so.
0x32ade95e7450992463b571c8e40521d036948739 a chill went down his back.
0x525029d757abf0a2ae4707ebb99e4655bdc9a3a9 “you keep telling lies,” he said slowly and weakly, twisting his lips into a sickly smile, “you are trying again to show that you know all my game, that you know all i shall say beforehand,” he said, conscious himself that he was not weighing his words as he ought.
0x40461d0a5695c3e3deec84e2775e7cdd5263628c “you want to frighten me... or you are simply laughing at me...” he still stared at him as he said this and again there was a light of intense hatred in his eyes.
0x6c954d0d0b106287a758fe2dc76af99ab77b445d “you keep lying,” he said.
0xf5a5edc7522f01c09cc33c829cc2d9c320b31fd2 “you know perfectly well that the best policy for the criminal is to tell the truth as nearly as possible... to conceal as little as possible.
0xd705d9d0dbee421e3e62d71808938c26f6e67768 i don’t believe you!”
0x074186f60af1b01f763816d00e0760c2a3036c9d “what a wily person you are!”
0x483e5889da8ea7cf40fb18a371f092e179ee83c0 porfiry tittered, “there’s no catching you; you’ve a perfect monomania.
0x55b114dcdaab3bef3ad5590da979729c2ea0caaf so you don’t believe me?
0xbaa0cc8e222b2791035b904326a737661b77ce16 but still you do believe me, you believe a quarter; i’ll soon make you believe the whole, because i have a sincere liking for you and genuinely wish you good.”
0x4b444d0b86af9078bbe4eb512b6cce797945d6aa raskolnikov’s lips trembled.
0xb3bf89ad6ef7db9eae7add7d0a74de58148a4c6a “yes, i do,” went on porfiry, touching raskolnikov’s arm genially, “you must take care of your illness.
0xb4d6c576e577c231ed850d3dc030d9baef54f2e3 besides, your mother and sister are here now; you must think of them.
0x1d89824f7267fe9e1b5af19d748c26e82f36e061 you must soothe and comfort them and you do nothing but frighten them...” “what has that to do with you?
0xcfd5bde8dc355de839aae08283ae296deb440f09 how do you know it?
0xd49974d8503e6cb93b0836a04948abc05518f588 what concern is it of yours?
0x5ba04802197070c85bac8f59ef8392bc644b65df you are keeping watch on me and want to let me know it?”
0x30b4b680a4068d82e915c51a0631bf04e40c8078 “good heavens!
0xea4c404c13b6c496ed2c096e1f2008b4a61f04d1 why, i learnt it all from you yourself!
0xfdd97b3b53fa03313ca35589a2de3db7338e84b4 you don’t notice that in your excitement you tell me and others everything.
0x4fd94b42c8319332ad68ced1250179d3317d275f from razumihin, too, i learnt a number of interesting details yesterday.
0x00c412f2055269ba72ca344b218e26fb3d9b502b no, you interrupted me, but i must tell you that, for all your wit, your suspiciousness makes you lose the common-sense view of things.
0x6d548e198efeb8e1966a2e3639640924ec9357d3 to return to bell-ringing, for instance.
0xe8d2d1d80dc2b926ed71ee977ccfcfc37152cf5d i, an examining lawyer, have betrayed a precious thing like that, a real fact (for it is a fact worth having), and you see nothing in it!
0x4d9bdacae30303b95cfcd94575152021eec976ac why, if i had the slightest suspicion of you, should i have acted like that?
0xfc3d1e1ac7d336c81fe610bfb242db8ac73ab500 no, i should first have disarmed your suspicions and not let you see i knew of that fact, should have diverted your attention and suddenly have dealt you a knock-down blow (your expression) saying: ‘and what were you doing, sir, pray, at ten or nearly eleven at the murdered woman’s flat and why did you ring the bell and why did you ask about blood?
0x79d32a734d977823c7689d6f62d4a5ecf0adefef and why did you invite the porters to go with you to the police station, to the lieutenant?’
0x890c15ad9513571dedc8e947c31e57da060b9b4d that’s how i ought to have acted if i had a grain of suspicion of you.
0x802ced63ed0d3ef2508e075d1e142032b018ac33 i ought to have taken your evidence in due form, searched your lodging and perhaps have arrested you, too... so i have no suspicion of you, since i have not done that!
0x1334a97747962c64aca89c8e54afedd226c9b764 but you can’t look at it normally and you see nothing, i say again.”
0x61061302bea928c18643e9648b91b0dc1ee3515e raskolnikov started so that porfiry petrovitch could not fail to perceive it.
0xf67aaaba4c634fa1b5b20078716a393bd1ba90db “you are lying all the while,” he cried, “i don’t know your object, but you are lying.
0xf554cc64f0a8e42a6d88f342e5697623140b5346 you did not speak like that just now and i cannot be mistaken!”
0x79bd4fbf9640d38d85a5fc142c43e0548d118eac “i am lying?”
0xafbd52497b013bcc58659a6c3c802442406483d7 porfiry repeated, apparently incensed, but preserving a good-humoured and ironical face, as though he were not in the least concerned at raskolnikov’s opinion of him.
0x23ac68e99c1a3d279f7a9c3b80a0119c141609b5 “i am lying... but how did i treat you just now, i, the examining lawyer?

0xa1646c8fe45458de1e376861dd8d74dea119b16b though, indeed, all those psychological means of defence are not very reliable and cut both ways: illness, delirium, i don’t remember--that’s all right, but why, my good sir, in your illness and in your delirium were you haunted by just those delusions and not by any others?
0xf4816896a52bad3dc19222e93b6fda3ff221e8ba there may have been others, eh?

0xf26a5a90ad8f0edffd721214cc8abaade3dd25fc raskolnikov looked haughtily and contemptuously at him.
0x40fcf50356ae38de6a44999520415813d8a39242 “briefly,” he said loudly and imperiously, rising to his feet and in so doing pushing porfiry back a little, “briefly, i want to know, do you acknowledge me perfectly free from suspicion or not?

0xf041f9d1377311e993242abf961858912f9dcfb3 cried porfiry with a perfectly good-humoured, sly and composed face.
0xf400edd81c52e1b63a58be5765818d7ae3721b0c “and why do you want to know, why do you want to know so much, since they haven’t begun to worry you?

0x35ce95317999f13de4a53d6445da9e9e8d92869f “i repeat,” raskolnikov cried furiously, “that i can’t put up with it!”

0x4b5f08d8698b17e914c9795683abe4486aa66059 interrupted porfiry.
0x646f81b0e49d3161b5c3aa7321263ef70976682b “don’t jeer at me!

0x623df30076224a9fda37d5fa0bf1888d3b0a8479 i am not joking,” porfiry whispered, but this time there was not the look of old womanish good nature and alarm in his face.
0xbd0fddc69bd25bd4af120dcb83f48d54861efffb now he was peremptory, stern, frowning and for once laying aside all mystification.
0xa66cbe39f12e9c5bee7a768389e8852b5df162a4 but this was only for an instant.
0xc8001886aaa5dea8d680560159815fb0f837e19d raskolnikov, bewildered, suddenly fell into actual frenzy, but, strange to say, he again obeyed the command to speak quietly, though he was in a perfect paroxysm of fury.
0x046cd159156bca394d0cd7a8718a4f1a89ac0283 “i will not allow myself to be tortured,” he whispered, instantly recognising with hatred that he could not help obeying the command and driven to even greater fury by the thought.
0x7aedeb71b23c45da186d6ff3852d14af3cac317b “arrest me, search me, but kindly act in due form and don’t play with me!
0xc14cc5bbc26218db02d40c9222f3cdd1250aa7ba don’t dare!”
0x875a6bc67ec62f73b29d9cf611eb1d8a0a8492ce “don’t worry about the form,” porfiry interrupted with the same sly smile, as it were, gloating with enjoyment over raskolnikov.
0xeadfbd7893a82f883d2b22bfd33b79e14dffd520 “i invited you to see me quite in a friendly way.”
0xad4f96320246fe4ae22237e3c6da26ad35c515a4 “i don’t want your friendship and i spit on it!
0x892edd27fd5dd89b52d361e72c79e19124efa604 do you hear?
0x2be7378f2ece5efd2b7116337959b32ebc757424 and, here, i take my cap and go.
0xe3b7674d522b42006bac9d280624dd647098778d what will you say now if you mean to arrest me?”
0x0c80c399cfe0e3f9bc5c8bd228f198a5d979758b he took up his cap and went to the door.
0x7e828d192d5b339a6bdf1e04129241b203979ba0 “and won’t you see my little surprise?”
0x9be7ebc9d8a064125070497ae32e4d67d25277e9 chuckled porfiry, again taking him by the arm and stopping him at the door.
0xec5dad10ffe0b6bbe5fd7515711e177040300f9d he seemed to become more playful and good-humoured which maddened raskolnikov.
0x7d160da30393d55a882661ac502359994bcfdbed “what surprise?”
0x0ab3a71a82e5aa64c10e40c78059147dffb50125 he asked, standing still and looking at porfiry in alarm.
0xde419088360d5307880a47b8aa99b321366255aa “my little surprise, it’s sitting there behind the door, he-he-he!”
0x1d910a212f270e7bd65e549de2b7dec419ab01b7 (he pointed to the locked door.)
0x565f92d0413dc8e1bbde5f9356c63e6d21f01d79 “i locked him in that he should not escape.”
0x9b4db6cac5e292fbc8dc25955eaab0ec6a862125 “what is it?
0x4bfc973915b15c34d41266101ffd5292e6935cd7 where?
0xaecac030fe3b2e688a9b0dc8883a5c827e5325a2 what?...”
0x7046fa8b54344e70ca614e6147fc96cd5c9d09f7 raskolnikov walked to the door and would have opened it, but it was locked.
0xe1f586e4162c311d3b957f55c0b2f15966af3460 “it’s locked, here is the key!”
0x227b210b510f6704b9fbaa3eb5b0de4267a498de and he brought a key out of his pocket.
0x485bdd077873ca9d2f2b1eb217df31a0d2e779de “you are lying,” roared raskolnikov without restraint, “you lie, you damned punchinello!”
0xf17c59c187ae65d5a4fb97726800cb57bdf6ba35 and he rushed at porfiry who retreated to the other door, not at all alarmed.
0x302a2d0e36a87424d3e377885f2815e5491ea5eb “i understand it all!
0x59801f7aa6e4690616cc530fa679e023487e6e04 you are lying and mocking so that i may betray myself to you...” “why, you could not betray yourself any further, my dear rodion romanovitch.

0x9108629e1dacaf1b8a7f8fe2987d8d568f658e7d eh!
0xf8025f4290dd711160597b8578fc7edc6b605199 what are you waiting for?
0x549e44ca6f000e5a4ec9f11384e14319b140a173 where are they?

0xe3b4f731888ef9ee2c49eee048c7c18a2f33cab3 “why deputies, my good man?
0x1eadd8ee3a8a986b9a54afdb9b97a6ddc333e61b what things people will imagine!
0xeb4508563e7e9c6af2453b678831c93faa47530c and to do so would not be acting in form as you say, you don’t know the business, my dear fellow.... and there’s no escaping form, as you see,” porfiry muttered, listening at the door through which a noise could be heard.
0x75133856e6f89928b9b4a7784e86c23635bdcff6 “ah, they’re coming,” cried raskolnikov.
0x12f5a8b7e8f5bb550ff4bc912ed92a234bf08868 “you’ve sent for them!
0xc7791ba4a33cf311311a202bde4ae365498e42ae you expected them!
0xa687a3f608f13e0912486068f7aa62785bfe01d1 well, produce them all: your deputies, your witnesses, what you like!... i am ready!”
0xbea6b482c3e2641c192e3d47a133d965fc0c73d0 but at this moment a strange incident occurred, something so unexpected that neither raskolnikov nor porfiry petrovitch could have looked for such a conclusion to their interview.
0x463e436f9b19f4219d53bc529645b9e6a6aa656d chapter vi when he remembered the scene afterwards, this is how raskolnikov saw it.
0x79efd1b0b69c30180e837e72457c6eaebf511d74 the noise behind the door increased, and suddenly the door was opened a little.
0xf7421ecf93fec117c5974f6568bf915fd84f7750 “what is it?”
0xf7b3a264478d61219273eb1d4466c4a02b92ae7b cried porfiry petrovitch, annoyed.
0x4a07bf8f964ac747d0c2db2ba3b1fbbab7aa2a32 “why, i gave orders...” for an instant there was no answer, but it was evident that there were several persons at the door, and that they were apparently pushing somebody back.
0xf7421ecf93fec117c5974f6568bf915fd84f7750 “what is it?”
0x6c3009928e76d029d5a8820edcfebac5e99d9377 porfiry petrovitch repeated, uneasily.
0xed0150af89124cd8760d0f00d01f3bae8a7c674b “the prisoner nikolay has been brought,” someone answered.
0x86d8654f39e2c00f5ecf8a51709400524489f8b3 “he is not wanted!
0x6fbbe714eb239a01f4aebda27e1517440d5ae0a3 take him away!
0xb99a42ad90eb99c55e928f1894a4831d20aefbb7 let him wait!
0xa4c933fd44db8527cfdcd74c80332cb6d3aa0013 what’s he doing here?
0xc0627eb08d800d55defd41ae9dbfd0c69021ceec how irregular!”
0xdfd659142db108386abc88292dd682fe6b78e87b cried porfiry, rushing to the door.
0x66fa4e993cc83c8d0d3ae072df9f53cc9e104989 “but he...” began the same voice, and suddenly ceased.
0x86fbdb0b58db761112418daa1b91e7984870f20f two seconds, not more, were spent in actual struggle, then someone gave a violent shove, and then a man, very pale, strode into the room.
0x7054b3129b0908b24f19d886422c1a2739888cf1 this man’s appearance was at first sight very strange.
0x9c6c6f7b140ca18980b48f3972b32d84affab195 he stared straight before him, as though seeing nothing.
0xd386a6db345e592c84b15a68fda2ecc79c946f1a there was a determined gleam in his eyes; at the same time there was a deathly pallor in his face, as though he were being led to the scaffold.
0xcb1a80a0df3b4bc76981aa47ba0f132a058ae37c his white lips were faintly twitching.
0x6b9d8766978af46a0e98ae7bb5e4709bfd5cddb5 he was dressed like a workman and was of medium height, very young, slim, his hair cut in round crop, with thin spare features.
0x68b26a890b8d1fc9e6069a5ff2d3352dc2df94e6 the man whom he had thrust back followed him into the room and succeeded in seizing him by the shoulder; he was a warder; but nikolay pulled his arm away.
0x97c02e8660638ad61c87070926f95f710cf650a2 several persons crowded inquisitively into the doorway.
0x0b6adc833d236d1de63e3bb5086daee524c6bb0c some of them tried to get in.
0x1bdea2aa0c622fcced3dece165a9b9087b46df40 all this took place almost instantaneously.
0x9cc1ebde39fe46b7c5c290edf67b9e03559d8b40 “go away, it’s too soon!
0x834fa602ff90161b7381fe4457f0a3478d246e3d wait till you are sent for!... why have you brought him so soon?”
0xfd27086399dcffeeab0c239c44cc9ce5431e08fc porfiry petrovitch muttered, extremely annoyed, and as it were thrown out of his reckoning.
0x1126232bc702cda3db87d9e3854db88b6a034d90 but nikolay suddenly knelt down.
0x5536203d7566170ce12f9e4f9e5b5e6860280dcf “what’s the matter?”
0x3c9819148d2ff1c13c2e15e0b57df0c28523a9df cried porfiry, surprised.
0x874568b5de9acedec2abf4ab695b497f9cf48ed7 “i am guilty!
0x89ab8060f41ae95a6b05da1538eaadd5b94a7227 mine is the sin!
0xa382310b5d05f5e3b9f1bb690786a34d2287726d i am the murderer,” nikolay articulated suddenly, rather breathless, but speaking fairly loudly.
0x6b499e7a895fd7af5208d4da6ffd16ee7d901f49 for ten seconds there was silence as though all had been struck dumb; even the warder stepped back, mechanically retreated to the door, and stood immovable.
0xf7421ecf93fec117c5974f6568bf915fd84f7750 “what is it?”
0x376273ded4029bbbddd108b4cde9cfbc3ae1ff8a cried porfiry petrovitch, recovering from his momentary stupefaction.
0x6504cf3c81f96257b02d728d35b88050dfcdaeaf “i... am the murderer,” repeated nikolay, after a brief pause.
0x3e059e6cb41921aa15974838e28eb5653e019e09 “what... you... what... whom did you kill?”
0x7d22ed9467a50d04a5a092c6a81a63ea5014a670 porfiry petrovitch was obviously bewildered.
0x72dbe42329952ec4ffb76289a25167e7a65930d6 nikolay again was silent for a moment.
0x1f19da25fbff21ce2a6eda5d75eece00ec280bdf “alyona ivanovna and her sister lizaveta ivanovna, i... killed... with an axe.
0xe4a8d76d5762097e56434b9e4c0519692f37eb11 darkness came over me,” he added suddenly, and was again silent.
0x070d89d6c59732f98e9816ccbb03de1ecde4b4d0 he still remained on his knees.
0x72c37fa0dc735664a31838ea1412610b6995d95e porfiry petrovitch stood for some moments as though meditating, but suddenly roused himself and waved back the uninvited spectators.
0xe292d85c1058aaf7470ad8a60b87235546b93234 they instantly vanished and closed the door.
0x6bd5e12adeada2a4354ccb2217f359bb32412419 then he looked towards raskolnikov, who was standing in the corner, staring wildly at nikolay and moved towards him, but stopped short, looked from nikolay to raskolnikov and then again at nikolay, and seeming unable to restrain himself darted at the latter.
0xe3174a3d75a19b06772a05499c298fa4bbd7c26e “you’re in too great a hurry,” he shouted at him, almost angrily.
0xbd797d5fdbbe07625e5e89f8c167ef01f997bb37 “i didn’t ask you what came over you.... speak, did you kill them?”
0x1b8f3036f82d9a7b2f7202b7994f978076b2be92 “i am the murderer.... i want to give evidence,” nikolay pronounced.
0x69ff88d0842b5baedd974f460e7120caf3d3907a “ach!
0xb138b7ab8a5fde2e67b559f51da54360d3013a83 what did you kill them with?”
0x86e12112b186d6d02f44a9f3225fee6de6a83455 “an axe.
0x7916d57da5429ca525a3ce54b10c974d38eb50fd i had it ready.”
0x09d61000f5df702ecd69d0737828506d397e51b6 “ach, he is in a hurry!
0x4a9f812f7c7e754d709739bd3e7677fcc33434e8 alone?”
0xbd9cf25ad50c16a3f4588e0d7a73e92031c96e04 nikolay did not understand the question.
0x325be81c15d0eb4f67ae1341def95cc41c643b05 “did you do it alone?”
0xe5e4c0ce75cde6407a337aac2bdff0be1d26ab61 “yes, alone.
0x8a9cf0a31415bfbd8d5b625b647ffa93886fc869 and mitka is not guilty and had no share in it.”
0x24d3ffb556dc856aebc3a77672ce7a1c3b432b21 “don’t be in a hurry about mitka!
0x002075b6cd8f436e39f478395a79ba910ed06ecf a-ach!
0x655fed996c74afd79f312ee875a6c2808611ba85 how was it you ran downstairs like that at the time?
0xb70d8f56af3c2b953802debeb1c68c5db9e86ac8 the porters met you both!”
0x9f755304cc9b0a86292f5eace53f99dc605bba6e “it was to put them off the scent... i ran after mitka,” nikolay replied hurriedly, as though he had prepared the answer.
0x137d07acfdf9df10d006172e4c4fe6accbf157eb “i knew it!”
0xc32c97b93c3df89bd04f7ecd6a4ed8331fbe53f4 cried porfiry, with vexation.
0xece4660dbf35408ae00958c3d797dd19105c524d “it’s not his own tale he is telling,” he muttered as though to himself, and suddenly his eyes rested on raskolnikov again.
0x272dbd2380eb55cfded48d864f3255db8950524a he was apparently so taken up with nikolay that for a moment he had forgotten raskolnikov.
0xe2990637eecf6933151d0a78e341307b5bf872fc he was a little taken aback.
0x8ee8829b96f7ba3578efbba03b4686d2f38bff87 “my dear rodion romanovitch, excuse me!”
0x9e970f9f1762552b56823ba97f6d6be604a52b60 he flew up to him, “this won’t do; i’m afraid you must go... it’s no good your staying... i will... you see, what a surprise!... good-bye!”
0x9940a12f329f4c936c8aabe6f6926554fb0e8afc and taking him by the arm, he showed him to the door.
0x471a1dc8686779c877222c7631fd0952ee539f1a “i suppose you didn’t expect it?”
0x438ec4d243dfa1596f056161914837b3bf59c565 said raskolnikov who, though he had not yet fully grasped the situation, had regained his courage.
0xb840929461705ca88d2b12ff60624525ceebba80 “you did not expect it either, my friend.
0xce988b6a8f3d277ece0acb4caf120f5797a385a6 see how your hand is trembling!

0xdd3bf48ab2c7ecfdd132be342331a898f24ac205 “you’re trembling, too, porfiry petrovitch!”
0x9bf1134fae461c2b0d243d2d1a33bca1a608570f “yes, i am; i didn’t expect it.”
0x255c4e0235333655fbe93c0dcdce0580b9f0fd6c they were already at the door; porfiry was impatient for raskolnikov to be gone.
0xd660af25e665812ee938faea4813a6de4b554d83 “and your little surprise, aren’t you going to show it to me?”
0x28ccd5688624fbf638ec4c9e8e43e4b613f2acb7 raskolnikov said, sarcastically.
0x6bc60ccefaed13e977b3edf244fe0c9223480337 “why, his teeth are chattering as he asks, he-he!
0x2598bd9d5a3cd01a17dd44ba4e76e76ffb020116 you are an ironical person!

0x09d7da225ae70aacb2aed87b0cb9d74590f8bc20 “i believe we can say _good-bye_!”
0xbaf3e6fa023dd96e0c99190b2d1cc284391ed4cc “that’s in god’s hands,” muttered porfiry, with an unnatural smile.
0xe2d6983c951a78c84d238aff36c6d2aa714d3bef as he walked through the office, raskolnikov noticed that many people were looking at him.
0xbc5cf8f48ddf2b713d5eac6cb98199413bc41b58 among them he saw the two porters from _the_ house, whom he had invited that night to the police station.
0x6d4056a98471016e409475360e0eb26e0648772c they stood there waiting.
0xcfe4d7365abe0c7793a8847150b579cf64b4f0d0 but he was no sooner on the stairs than he heard the voice of porfiry petrovitch behind him.
0x4562a988b893259a43cfc119f12ee477be4df51b turning round, he saw the latter running after him, out of breath.
0xdaba23068d7b2f140e6799dd509b5fe474e0495e “one word, rodion romanovitch; as to all the rest, it’s in god’s hands, but as a matter of form there are some questions i shall have to ask you... so we shall meet again, shan’t we?”
0xdacac75483cce7b72baebd43f58f8a5449839301 and porfiry stood still, facing him with a smile.
0x269feabd052cd400c8e8d86189c9689f6f9176e4 “shan’t we?”
0xff5c01c3dd233af04d90f52777bf8b2f4941bdc8 he added again.
0xda22f77a816030dc8118ad055172cea7e848468b he seemed to want to say something more, but could not speak out.
0x0bb4c19f22fa3ebd5dd0c9caef00eb63213b1ba3 “you must forgive me, porfiry petrovitch, for what has just passed... i lost my temper,” began raskolnikov, who had so far regained his courage that he felt irresistibly inclined to display his coolness.
0x1360f078753708b19b3fa7f5893a09aa692beb46 “don’t mention it, don’t mention it,” porfiry replied, almost gleefully.
0xe2c76bacfa3cc01cd3f06b86d188df73a871829c “i myself, too... i have a wicked temper, i admit it!
0x259912dc9b37f0fb57ddac7952dc469d1a36e512 but we shall meet again.
0x32a3e58eb46daaec40047456fdf83fedbf815aa8 if it’s god’s will, we may see a great deal of one another.”
0xf6d670623b7493a68e394459259469b2988e52bf “and will get to know each other through and through?”
0x192ceee2aa445cb7193190eb457024f3762173b6 added raskolnikov.
0xf5aaf7a8f0330c6bcdd37dca119224b54dea5d8f “yes; know each other through and through,” assented porfiry petrovitch, and he screwed up his eyes, looking earnestly at raskolnikov.
0xeb36454d37278a229e73eb0a219d34b489224220 “now you’re going to a birthday party?”
0x725e08750f8f828a2414bda3fa0933b8419fd074 “to a funeral.”
0x2d033f803c140ade21dfb54fb80049d2ed5ea1c6 “of course, the funeral!
0xc0a9cc0c396de4495143e8e209b3412efb6f00ed take care of yourself, and get well.”
0xea23270119bd5d5a85502563127ef129060b33e3 “i don’t know what to wish you,” said raskolnikov, who had begun to descend the stairs, but looked back again.
0x2152e23b8ea72578a6658be32db6c29ccd7632f7 “i should like to wish you success, but your office is such a comical one.”
0xb73849b200429cf5c50d9ae41a67bd8a1d1b69b0 “why comical?”
0x934335b3df941fec68971c9a98e965122d677d9f porfiry petrovitch had turned to go, but he seemed to prick up his ears at this.
0xd2e092e05a4a58e74d0d205b9dd0689d0a1ffedb “why, how you must have been torturing and harassing that poor nikolay psychologically, after your fashion, till he confessed!
0xc1c9e977c13dbc3a9ffeaaa37f5ca40e5015b631 you must have been at him day and night, proving to him that he was the murderer, and now that he has confessed, you’ll begin vivisecting him again.
0x1e748c8277629068b9950766336fb972337a5752 ‘you are lying,’ you’ll say.
0xfef49f0a2fd5f9a2bfb9c906942ce1fe97c925e5 ‘you are not the murderer!
0x79686d3f80bcd88e69a522c59623a06413aa8b46 you can’t be!
0x3251820ca9551d391c4b35d2b8d2c7d4b49c6425 it’s not your own tale you are telling!’
0x24bf8c80ce2ec4196bddefc2a8eefbe310cb9003 you must admit it’s a comical business!”
0xcae35fdd72c8c4343ba04b75a4e17416ebacdd8d “he-he-he!
0xd497a20012c40f6f9ffdadb0d4a53533e5e65a24 you noticed then that i said to nikolay just now that it was not his own tale he was telling?”
0xb20145d2f656bbd7ac555a0d7658da60755974ff “how could i help noticing it!”
0x04f88e0715c6f378152463b3bd0817bab41073f5 “he-he!
0xe8ab8a99e0d4caeaecef3f5d20885bc7cfabbfbe you are quick-witted.

0x630046406a8b8edc74381df59adcecc6dedece2f and you always fasten on the comic side... he-he!
0x646c1bb7b7ceeca3148ee5d7e6b82547d513d67c they say that was the marked characteristic of gogol, among the writers.”
0xb1b9d21eb95e277b2935e5f40c53744df7273f90 “yes, of gogol.”
0xd568886781fa121f8801b091b749a98bb0ade129 “yes, of gogol.... i shall look forward to meeting you.”
0x4cc16a008afa9ad1507a6b7bcbcba61f57761c3a “so shall i.”
0x00ed982dda8cba5c61c41461d12b2bcad58bf990 raskolnikov walked straight home.
0x852fc71ff7da2c0b7fa325b47de58b0219ec3213 he was so muddled and bewildered that on getting home he sat for a quarter of an hour on the sofa, trying to collect his thoughts.
0x297b482ca3c788bff9efcaa6d6205af1780cd543 he did not attempt to think about nikolay; he was stupefied; he felt that his confession was something inexplicable, amazing--something beyond his understanding.
0x15267cfbee145fb708a21c02fdccffb1d4072a78 but nikolay’s confession was an actual fact.
0x86053323eee6bf4dc3f2beff0292287bce512f06 the consequences of this fact were clear to him at once, its falsehood could not fail to be discovered, and then they would be after him again.
0x697c1006cd07e99c7abfd4e6475491ad2553cbb9 till then, at least, he was free and must do something for himself, for the danger was imminent.
0x1faec4d4ca239faa3b81504b445aca825752f0d3 but how imminent?
0xc1212e30dd41309cca1851aea09a3797c8715e43 his position gradually became clear to him.
0xc2f955923f9e12fb52bd6443fee0daf4535e2075 remembering, sketchily, the main outlines of his recent scene with porfiry, he could not help shuddering again with horror.
0x7cb2b56f46e997c8e8c1c1f2af35058b434d2bf8 of course, he did not yet know all porfiry’s aims, he could not see into all his calculations.
0x05eb8c6a7e4f39625287106feb0bbd431d93a8ed but he had already partly shown his hand, and no one knew better than raskolnikov how terrible porfiry’s “lead” had been for him.
0x61ed3c45067a32c967d89f6bcb1e1b43762f1064 a little more and he _might_ have given himself away completely, circumstantially.
0x945acec9705b896de601d368ad051d2ee95f961d knowing his nervous temperament and from the first glance seeing through him, porfiry, though playing a bold game, was bound to win.
0x45c7b9cddc85f42e70e6ba7ea0bd938345e8cea9 there’s no denying that raskolnikov had compromised himself seriously, but no _facts_ had come to light as yet; there was nothing positive.
0x75317667d945575231daead2821965fbf27a9a44 but was he taking a true view of the position?
0x1895bd291fec6934252161cb84f7d38a29bd9291 wasn’t he mistaken?
0x25fca2684eebfa0fbaa4d851ec1be878967f49b7 what had porfiry been trying to get at?
0x88349ed5f62f66f6e7b523daff48a7dfd53de794 had he really some surprise prepared for him?
0xdce1f9d77f6db143662de6f4712d7f61751ada74 and what was it?
0xe38cf2ed4556008b99588272b98852d79ae68eda had he really been expecting something or not?
0x1bac0fde22ca4adb372370b2f26e1417cf119161 how would they have parted if it had not been for the unexpected appearance of nikolay?
0x7e44d163e7e217e2fc8d6995293fa7ed76484768 porfiry had shown almost all his cards--of course, he had risked something in showing them--and if he had really had anything up his sleeve (raskolnikov reflected), he would have shown that, too.
0x82630cc56bc1566c61f729435eaec40cb528b778 what was that “surprise”?
0x88f3951ea302a0a8456228779de6715707a8cd32 was it a joke?
0xb72f8381c563b6167d4c78927dfc50d5f5b2e2a2 had it meant anything?
0x6b012c32950363c6d913aba65439d7357f25e807 could it have concealed anything like a fact, a piece of positive evidence?
0xf521d79eca458703a0ad13baab39c50a6203808a his yesterday’s visitor?
0x8c1bbcd5bab827174584e67f9afd729d29ec9960 what had become of him?
0x79b922116697ac1d5b8b11915d61697c23ab2b6e where was he to-day?
0xdc25dbe6651134504f274371c1718cb722b47365 if porfiry really had any evidence, it must be connected with him.... he sat on the sofa with his elbows on his knees and his face hidden in his hands.
0xfce3356449c1587fe5c2d3aab1fa7e230c89d8a6 he was still shivering nervously.
0xed93ef1a187b2b44105d365276a5c6328d5bc27b at last he got up, took his cap, thought a minute, and went to the door.
0x7e02b66895bf6c472e75332b1bf450ace3059145 he had a sort of presentiment that for to-day, at least, he might consider himself out of danger.
0x06abdb09d37d84dbd7d859f511543f5f88d6018b he had a sudden sense almost of joy; he wanted to make haste to katerina ivanovna’s.
0x90a1c6f59274efedadc9e2a7d1f2db7bb890d456 he would be too late for the funeral, of course, but he would be in time for the memorial dinner, and there at once he would see sonia.
0xf79e2e3ee9b72c25da452d1011d4c3278a76739b he stood still, thought a moment, and a suffering smile came for a moment on to his lips.
0x83d52207e8edcad7fdec10c695ff03cbf848edb0 “to-day!
0xda9b5e970549ccd76a55b91ec31e00e899a4522c to-day,” he repeated to himself.
0xa56462ab75b1e96e7642656ccc90d98a55c7c947 “yes, to-day!
0x53f0d2e8d1c8f62069bfc1eb9a517ebdf39a8934 so it must be....” but as he was about to open the door, it began opening of itself.
0xcb153148300dfe96447191a9454f1de56456f916 he started and moved back.
0xc2536e8a5af199868ee0ddd012cd58621aed8293 the door opened gently and slowly, and there suddenly appeared a figure--yesterday’s visitor _from underground_.
0x3ade67cfcc55b05a6e5adcfd793861a28c27aa51 the man stood in the doorway, looked at raskolnikov without speaking, and took a step forward into the room.
0x75834e1975a56b4a2caa25036e8062888d51c24e he was exactly the same as yesterday; the same figure, the same dress, but there was a great change in his face; he looked dejected and sighed deeply.
0x0b7e15bf10c5d5f1cdd9a029f9f50acfd4660a1b if he had only put his hand up to his cheek and leaned his head on one side he would have looked exactly like a peasant woman.
0x721ede191520c07dca21bffcf2c4a846f673e300 “what do you want?”
0x8acf9899438dcdcf7a2a969e8e88208e853a5434 asked raskolnikov, numb with terror.
0x4ae7ce5d7272d178298b6f95e0ae544a390d7503 the man was still silent, but suddenly he bowed down almost to the ground, touching it with his finger.
0xf7421ecf93fec117c5974f6568bf915fd84f7750 “what is it?”
0x7b8b6091ba58f4640a164803487c404180d15f9d cried raskolnikov.
0xff2cc35a346bf5f132c6fe4e22bbdc13668c8923 “i have sinned,” the man articulated softly.
0x36bafcaf95444617832ea897363b94a65ce0f655 “how?”
0x2d9ce0054585e3e49dc68893ae95a4f828c6c214 “by evil thoughts.”
0xde694f244198ca23aa969c13976014d468ca0a07 they looked at one another.
0x97ce3507de852cb106c25e653ada19523ab2da16 “i was vexed.
0xb88d8e9f5ea0fcdda23293dd2c7704e892b01df4 when you came, perhaps in drink, and bade the porters go to the police station and asked about the blood, i was vexed that they let you go and took you for drunken.
0x493740e4c95edb830f25ba763e2b17bcac21e72f i was so vexed that i lost my sleep.
0x4565608349267fe5f0267bf08771ad6b9baa2252 and remembering the address we came here yesterday and asked for you....” “who came?”
0xc517d8d2258612bb20000d5c3b963b1b65eb8792 raskolnikov interrupted, instantly beginning to recollect.
0x230c18b95fca707a246ecb110b1350854c88251e “i did, i’ve wronged you.”
0xd215a135d1e29c9212426a88e503059830572b14 “then you come from that house?”
0x8628bc46336205bd650ad4732b4c7be859b6afff “i was standing at the gate with them... don’t you remember?
0x768ee4ea2942553fea3232289f201604ccaea429 we have carried on our trade in that house for years past.
0x1a4a4857d26a4fb476a233c4fe7e329b65120400 we cure and prepare hides, we take work home... most of all i was vexed....” and the whole scene of the day before yesterday in the gateway came clearly before raskolnikov’s mind; he recollected that there had been several people there besides the porters, women among them.
0x0b352dea3997fc9f81370720abaa981bb2b2a4a5 he remembered one voice had suggested taking him straight to the police-station.
0x2dbe27609100d564b41e61a8e9063975b9162fc0 he could not recall the face of the speaker, and even now he did not recognise it, but he remembered that he had turned round and made him some answer.... so this was the solution of yesterday’s horror.
0x092247c6a14794b7c93f927b2efe0469fbfcd25c the most awful thought was that he had been actually almost lost, had almost done for himself on account of such a _trivial_ circumstance.
0x66f9704f9d6387be7759c4e9afbd3fab71e8bf43 so this man could tell nothing except his asking about the flat and the blood stains.
0x23cd299e8513f20d19a272855cc1a0b93f2bc5ef so porfiry, too, had nothing but that _delirium_, no facts but this _psychology_ which _cuts both ways_, nothing positive.
0x905b0452b3c351f958c1c50fc8828d54ef27ac62 so if no more facts come to light (and they must not, they must not!)
0x2e661cf77ce4c98c5ef80c30af23091c7dd1f71f then... then what can they do to him?
0x21f7c12cae6c364080893e43a4f16d0bf40c1627 how can they convict him, even if they arrest him?
0xf65c83a79e2e7aaecdd19b1213816bf1d671a16c and porfiry then had only just heard about the flat and had not known about it before.
0xb54314a466791d15271b0460642323ad5ea3113e “was it you who told porfiry... that i’d been there?”
0x9a5dd0d7c9fda7dbbd687e2f316808365d7b3a13 he cried, struck by a sudden idea.
0x2262777c44c77fd75970283046a70999880d3762 “what porfiry?”
0xd90e63e8fc57e164893e49ca76135f6452f526f8 “the head of the detective department?”
0x3e66b09a2263bd850e03257d7386a9307a6e9674 “yes.
0x7b045b42d085d2adfaa10dd974e4fc08f080ba94 the porters did not go there, but i went.”
0x4b488dedf6834fd4faf1d0a210cc2200a25b0173 “to-day?”
0x503f0dd8f4259df60c81d2bc2621eab61be8e693 “i got there two minutes before you.
0x0f6a6bc0925a106e3af3645ea6fa3134062609ef and i heard, i heard it all, how he worried you.”
0x0c30f20b7f52706317eed1cf4969c75850a54d1e “where?
0x8b0be37871a605d16f7fb35e6898e847d93f03f1 what?
0x73f3251f6f7607efa65512c7896cff5e14de27b9 when?”
0x417a267c578a4637a946e3c19a4e4df5226103e0 “why, in the next room.
0xbc777b6693f4b5079227e3fd02c1c6363835cb48 i was sitting there all the time.”
0xd925ce5fccd34b0b9314565227fa1f35fbe7007c “what?
0xb958b4883fcd87bc01fb5be7f9b1c9cd4300f525 why, then you were the surprise?
0x8ede92f658e6f8162fdde1178607c901ac5d5331 but how could it happen?
0x172633720d57205e7b44021ffca26f3276317145 upon my word!”
0x0adc1c22623c9a7f1608c2571df56a37b2bde79f “i saw that the porters did not want to do what i said,” began the man; “for it’s too late, said they, and maybe he’ll be angry that we did not come at the time.
0x4e7e9016165a7d9303aadb15a1014cdf5499b096 i was vexed and i lost my sleep, and i began making inquiries.
0xc7884ffe205360dbf8e821a62009e7f0c43ca872 and finding out yesterday where to go, i went to-day.
0x203df9693f275aef2801709ae74bd607de2c45e2 the first time i went he wasn’t there, when i came an hour later he couldn’t see me.
0xd2ba22ff38debe6ff4a7e68cd00cebdf66221223 i went the third time, and they showed me in.
0x4b7f8a2bd792680fb789f271e5dc7e3defaab4ea i informed him of everything, just as it happened, and he began skipping about the room and punching himself on the chest.
0xf71b948175a4266cb5fa6251ad33aeb6107b765b ‘what do you scoundrels mean by it?
0x6ffcc6cc3de2bac8fcce44fb586714774c3d390c if i’d known about it i should have arrested him!’
0xba2f525e14b1a9ea4f56c3cfc7831c3c8c2dc9eb then he ran out, called somebody and began talking to him in the corner, then he turned to me, scolding and questioning me.
0x6e70cc5cd6f8c1a5a574fe36aeda430da12a1a1b he scolded me a great deal; and i told him everything, and i told him that you didn’t dare to say a word in answer to me yesterday and that you didn’t recognise me.
0x44dcb58b8ad6d20f9e3acb34941a936469e511de and he fell to running about again and kept hitting himself on the chest, and getting angry and running about, and when you were announced he told me to go into the next room.
0xf9da0474ca9200be69c725c8e9dedeb0a2fb44ba ‘sit there a bit,’ he said.
0xcb5ff40bd624c8d94f479cce6ea3ed22a83b0635 ‘don’t move, whatever you may hear.’
0x67a72d1e75192e92aa45d94e5fff0933861cc9c9 and he set a chair there for me and locked me in.
0x2b45d99ecc3acc7c72758c933a1ce296129d7844 ‘perhaps,’ he said, ‘i may call you.’
0x9c18c2ff00f61a707819b53a8beaccf66771ab28 and when nikolay’d been brought he let me out as soon as you were gone.
0xc93c1c45606a674ba031be232f2d79977d2c5a97 ‘i shall send for you again and question you,’ he said.”
0x8bcbcff1dea4937dcc3f87839198d34f2d8445c2 “and did he question nikolay while you were there?”
0xcb45f52ff7dc5d413abf5318c9b7355ba1a695b7 “he got rid of me as he did of you, before he spoke to nikolay.”
0x644dd8f72a44bdcc60b4053b1e3b3fcedb5fcdd1 the man stood still, and again suddenly bowed down, touching the ground with his finger.
0xe2445dc1eb52443b07606bb4d8537f8a6aeed49f “forgive me for my evil thoughts, and my slander.”
0x769de2c41662203e987e2a5e0c8b7929df97d665 “may god forgive you,” answered raskolnikov.
0xc5bdb18015ebacc433e8421fa8760bf7bf799c81 and as he said this, the man bowed down again, but not to the ground, turned slowly and went out of the room.
0xdc4d738ded23529a4406308345f2d227fbac9c37 “it all cuts both ways, now it all cuts both ways,” repeated raskolnikov, and he went out more confident than ever.
0x595442da37c6b9807f582a83d8059b5debdb22d8 “now we’ll make a fight for it,” he said, with a malicious smile, as he went down the stairs.
0x0f21eebdc7ce65b427bfb1a9f5a6685d69b83dde his malice was aimed at himself; with shame and contempt he recollected his “cowardice.”
0x623d254f010233a20b074e87fccc5ffda8e0795b part v chapter i the morning that followed the fateful interview with dounia and her mother brought sobering influences to bear on pyotr petrovitch.
0xaa124e065b4be3e257910845f15aab36b6f8f3ca intensely unpleasant as it was, he was forced little by little to accept as a fact beyond recall what had seemed to him only the day before fantastic and incredible.
0xd9e5cd0c4b2e9b983bbf29f0c60b553c678a767b the black snake of wounded vanity had been gnawing at his heart all night.
0x4b0e2ac7a495756924d3e496d431455455771054 when he got out of bed, pyotr petrovitch immediately looked in the looking-glass.
0xbfbb13ebaaf2532debff5eead620360949c354f8 he was afraid that he had jaundice.
0xed9904572539b57814fbe9ecd72a7eb1d9911ff3 however his health seemed unimpaired so far, and looking at his noble, clear-skinned countenance which had grown fattish of late, pyotr petrovitch for an instant was positively comforted in the conviction that he would find another bride and, perhaps, even a better one.
0xc02c61dc48e2c022c2cef1d1ea0efef4575b54f9 but coming back to the sense of his present position, he turned aside and spat vigorously, which excited a sarcastic smile in andrey semyonovitch lebeziatnikov, the young friend with whom he was staying.
0x9cc400dacc625237ab214583bbda048649d5f334 that smile pyotr petrovitch noticed, and at once set it down against his young friend’s account.
0xdfdc12de449a61f41fb1d0bb1c0337fdc44c73af he had set down a good many points against him of late.
0xcfc0bf67900c5311b6a69f5ed78a9a3110198f8b his anger was redoubled when he reflected that he ought not to have told andrey semyonovitch about the result of yesterday’s interview.
0xd44a70028ef35da648d9a64ce015882ab82459a6 that was the second mistake he had made in temper, through impulsiveness and irritability.... moreover, all that morning one unpleasantness followed another.
0x3e96f851819c85fa3b7f22ab301da8c30dd3dbf1 he even found a hitch awaiting him in his legal case in the senate.
0x3ed8eee2c78d2e3061cd1981ccbc5d41ba501f9d he was particularly irritated by the owner of the flat which had been taken in view of his approaching marriage and was being redecorated at his own expense; the owner, a rich german tradesman, would not entertain the idea of breaking the contract which had just been signed and insisted on the full forfeit money, though pyotr petrovitch would be giving him back the flat practically redecorated.
0x7c835c50b4bc0a7b9a7b2ad04cf5a644af8ab4d4 in the same way the upholsterers refused to return a single rouble of the instalment paid for the furniture purchased but not yet removed to the flat.
0x4b37dfbd9c76e1b1df4c0fe9fd7e9030c078f4b0 “am i to get married simply for the sake of the furniture?”
0xacdd183f186fa9aa219e608cca866522ebe4a7aa pyotr petrovitch ground his teeth and at the same time once more he had a gleam of desperate hope.
0x4ab99c4743e30088c565c7bb46d9d0dc767848f4 “can all that be really so irrevocably over?
0xcaa772f5fd93fd3552534aaf10a668606d084d7e is it no use to make another effort?”
0xfdc904c3c4411fbdf1c1bd2f2b52918e2e7f3aff the thought of dounia sent a voluptuous pang through his heart.
0x779cc57b8d77024cc9c276b586b24cef1a931612 he endured anguish at that moment, and if it had been possible to slay raskolnikov instantly by wishing it, pyotr petrovitch would promptly have uttered the wish.
0x505fe9307945e90b1acb190581b7c203559b094c “it was my mistake, too, not to have given them money,” he thought, as he returned dejectedly to lebeziatnikov’s room, “and why on earth was i such a jew?
0x00018333b4a8db0dabc270b5b993d1bd73341c75 it was false economy!
0x7a527e39770a7b258d504430f7c1a0e6b0cc842f i meant to keep them without a penny so that they should turn to me as their providence, and look at them!
0x4bf3e335199107182c6f7638efaad377acc7f452 foo!
0x3c28a41a95ad7657ee1903eb1029fbe20380f061 if i’d spent some fifteen hundred roubles on them for the trousseau and presents, on knick-knacks, dressing-cases, jewellery, materials, and all that sort of trash from knopp’s and the english shop, my position would have been better and... stronger!
0x63eaa575f92646c28cb5295185caab74c4e333ff they could not have refused me so easily!
0x7137bac0176bfb11d402b171e6cd0f5e0fac20a4 they are the sort of people that would feel bound to return money and presents if they broke it off; and they would find it hard to do it!
0xac48982b3824e42808a081363f7d2bb5d50511a0 and their conscience would prick them: how can we dismiss a man who has hitherto been so generous and delicate?.... h’m!
0x545140cc92137525a389945753aca616017b5a87 i’ve made a blunder.”
0x60aca4c7b1f9bf9f634830c70cf8c8196cd4f991 and grinding his teeth again, pyotr petrovitch called himself a fool--but not aloud, of course.
0x68d4972c2dd47fab9b1f5c9f4db3ca42d5a4f594 he returned home, twice as irritated and angry as before.
0xc3c6099541c30f890eab926db0e1aac85fca7dd6 the preparations for the funeral dinner at katerina ivanovna’s excited his curiosity as he passed.
0xc746c905a1be6d035fd5ce54069a9967e7ce5fba he had heard about it the day before; he fancied, indeed, that he had been invited, but absorbed in his own cares he had paid no attention.
0xee2a16d4266d2a46479febdfd9ab5d7b60d47ba7 inquiring of madame lippevechsel who was busy laying the table while katerina ivanovna was away at the cemetery, he heard that the entertainment was to be a great affair, that all the lodgers had been invited, among them some who had not known the dead man, that even andrey semyonovitch lebeziatnikov was invited in spite of his previous quarrel with katerina ivanovna, that he, pyotr petrovitch, was not only invited, but was eagerly expected as he was the most important of the lodgers.
0x1e35d241f845677300414d610c40f71d9901d77c amalia ivanovna herself had been invited with great ceremony in spite of the recent unpleasantness, and so she was very busy with preparations and was taking a positive pleasure in them; she was moreover dressed up to the nines, all in new black silk, and she was proud of it.
0xb3e4b4d9cf2ecde0d66b83aace5fc4e993dddf52 all this suggested an idea to pyotr petrovitch and he went into his room, or rather lebeziatnikov’s, somewhat thoughtful.
0x6f6eacf8a443e1f3c671ae74823f53a3fc3a74c4 he had learnt that raskolnikov was to be one of the guests.
0x6787ac600a3af6e340e115dc79acd248a7520c8f andrey semyonovitch had been at home all the morning.
0x833475247ed3b6ce5b6437337af14a2fedc1a969 the attitude of pyotr petrovitch to this gentleman was strange, though perhaps natural.
0x90fead1806091f1fb9e7fe73b4c9707ecd59e9ff pyotr petrovitch had despised and hated him from the day he came to stay with him and at the same time he seemed somewhat afraid of him.
0x5abd95bb520a55f48d241766f310562c51e84be2 he had not come to stay with him on his arrival in petersburg simply from parsimony, though that had been perhaps his chief object.
0x9d29aa75a17ee018c3cd835b170e27447574343e he had heard of andrey semyonovitch, who had once been his ward, as a leading young progressive who was taking an important part in certain interesting circles, the doings of which were a legend in the provinces.
0xda33f9e1eff96c8622b6d708251c8e85f88ecf99 it had impressed pyotr petrovitch.
0xfa771c576fd804a7f518675369c290eabd2f57ca these powerful omniscient circles who despised everyone and showed everyone up had long inspired in him a peculiar but quite vague alarm.
0x780913bed55ea2c5fb26e91b5455d3e796416cab he had not, of course, been able to form even an approximate notion of what they meant.
0xe2fabb9344187e9d1975cde9a5eacfa24b2b3a8a he, like everyone, had heard that there were, especially in petersburg, progressives of some sort, nihilists and so on, and, like many people, he exaggerated and distorted the significance of those words to an absurd degree.
0x4e10760f879de827c157d0aecdbf7b5a41cafd36 what for many years past he had feared more than anything was _being shown up_ and this was the chief ground for his continual uneasiness at the thought of transferring his business to petersburg.
0x3968282a01188d92fa64ffa23fe6f37f46d052e7 he was afraid of this as little children are sometimes panic-stricken.
0xde66022f1a29acd875af82c7ecb3ef1753e37496 some years before, when he was just entering on his own career, he had come upon two cases in which rather important personages in the province, patrons of his, had been cruelly shown up.
0xe4175eaeb49996b620d34cd78c951f8071e77a0c one instance had ended in great scandal for the person attacked and the other had very nearly ended in serious trouble.
0x988193e09bc5082887592cb2c14cb436577ed01b for this reason pyotr petrovitch intended to go into the subject as soon as he reached petersburg and, if necessary, to anticipate contingencies by seeking the favour of “our younger generation.”
0x04e463891e6ee543813f43ddcca79cdbb940e4a0 he relied on andrey semyonovitch for this and before his visit to raskolnikov he had succeeded in picking up some current phrases.
0x3c0f75b2ed3896b43bb04c5cade83e37c50ce3ce he soon discovered that andrey semyonovitch was a commonplace simpleton, but that by no means reassured pyotr petrovitch.
0xc757837eb796d12cbfca4c65f79bf8426410c028 even if he had been certain that all the progressives were fools like him, it would not have allayed his uneasiness.
0x6752bc7a883442bfa564fcc7590551b5ea8f1b7b all the doctrines, the ideas, the systems, with which andrey semyonovitch pestered him had no interest for him.
0x4553a64e905dd3ef02caf1cd3ac0bcad0ae87bbd he had his own object--he simply wanted to find out at once what was happening _here_.
0x6a04ab9333763e4c1d4ca36913601c082ec9a84a had these people any power or not?
0x60fb6bb4a941f39d9648312f347149c5f55ff234 had he anything to fear from them?
0x97aa103eb6504419a0b958b857d55d86116789b5 would they expose any enterprise of his?
0x70a3f2024f91eb412542dff122404624f548c10a and what precisely was now the object of their attacks?
0x7939d5dcbd9e65ca53b65f0d45d80496c54f2281 could he somehow make up to them and get round them if they really were powerful?
0x1f501f6e8c23373ce644cd03b768c8e2c93866e5 was this the thing to do or not?
0xc5ee5943a6bd270f3de87feec670d12ff7b5f821 couldn’t he gain something through them?
0x897134940afdd2b37b588fb4feaf658c7a68aaa0 in fact hundreds of questions presented themselves.
0x6aeacf65f19b73da7e4593d091f188684b98e908 andrey semyonovitch was an anæmic, scrofulous little man, with strangely flaxen mutton-chop whiskers of which he was very proud.
0xc4c6d86b33c66efdeefe52caa1f6fd048698a9ab he was a clerk and had almost always something wrong with his eyes.
0x33b2b85cc16e9bcd9bbdb8911409af3dbf720139 he was rather soft-hearted, but self-confident and sometimes extremely conceited in speech, which had an absurd effect, incongruous with his little figure.
0x1490441700842012b2a185284664a14200bbefbd he was one of the lodgers most respected by amalia ivanovna, for he did not get drunk and paid regularly for his lodgings.
0x6abed8ece7c1a5670b4018305837056f0d4bc365 andrey semyonovitch really was rather stupid; he attached himself to the cause of progress and “our younger generation” from enthusiasm.
0x16c92f8127ad0b0b41f3ca9014208fc86c42ae9f he was one of the numerous and varied legion of dullards, of half-animate abortions, conceited, half-educated coxcombs, who attach themselves to the idea most in fashion only to vulgarise it and who caricature every cause they serve, however sincerely.
0x7baeeb545fee90e935780fd50abe65f66ce4847e though lebeziatnikov was so good-natured, he, too, was beginning to dislike pyotr petrovitch.
0xace995920326ef576417ea74cf5fc78a12cb66e0 this happened on both sides unconsciously.
0xf5444293ccd683a637c6ff1d39576fced4abcce9 however simple andrey semyonovitch might be, he began to see that pyotr petrovitch was duping him and secretly despising him, and that “he was not the right sort of man.”
0x3f991c1d1b0de1e22cb1232b14f712ff6af6dae3 he had tried expounding to him the system of fourier and the darwinian theory, but of late pyotr petrovitch began to listen too sarcastically and even to be rude.
0x4e2036e2ea58303a0281981ff95dcde5242a8773 the fact was he had begun instinctively to guess that lebeziatnikov was not merely a commonplace simpleton, but, perhaps, a liar, too, and that he had no connections of any consequence even in his own circle, but had simply picked things up third-hand; and that very likely he did not even know much about his own work of propaganda, for he was in too great a muddle.
0xd7a882d30062b61a439c122b016fdd400cfc712f a fine person he would be to show anyone up!
0xc5b892e2e28b74f5cc8e5b9f8b71443059c09c5c it must be noted, by the way, that pyotr petrovitch had during those ten days eagerly accepted the strangest praise from andrey semyonovitch; he had not protested, for instance, when andrey semyonovitch belauded him for being ready to contribute to the establishment of the new “commune,” or to abstain from christening his future children, or to acquiesce if dounia were to take a lover a month after marriage, and so on.
0x68f255a3a1c8fb52a8c38735c1524715140e3a7b pyotr petrovitch so enjoyed hearing his own praises that he did not disdain even such virtues when they were attributed to him.
0x7b2568afd13d8b23bbcb56012c0494f77e44d9a4 pyotr petrovitch had had occasion that morning to realise some five-per-cent bonds and now he sat down to the table and counted over bundles of notes.
0x08ba8b7bb1539bd150d4206c1d3e0f5cf9e0d68c andrey semyonovitch who hardly ever had any money walked about the room pretending to himself to look at all those bank notes with indifference and even contempt.
0xbb383b4edbdac5cea162d45a4e1f6ce450e168c3 nothing would have convinced pyotr petrovitch that andrey semyonovitch could really look on the money unmoved, and the latter, on his side, kept thinking bitterly that pyotr petrovitch was capable of entertaining such an idea about him and was, perhaps, glad of the opportunity of teasing his young friend by reminding him of his inferiority and the great difference between them.
0x561318bfec08eefe415687e15e95ada1b0dcdac9 he found him incredibly inattentive and irritable, though he, andrey semyonovitch, began enlarging on his favourite subject, the foundation of a new special “commune.”
0xa97a83978ba306c3a568cdda7aa8867ba8fc709a the brief remarks that dropped from pyotr petrovitch between the clicking of the beads on the reckoning frame betrayed unmistakable and discourteous irony.
0x6d9040663c9401617a1c0986ff5164f58cf0cc37 but the “humane” andrey semyonovitch ascribed pyotr petrovitch’s ill-humour to his recent breach with dounia and he was burning with impatience to discourse on that theme.
0xc0f5e46d12600b46bcdcf6aed83cb33d9865c874 he had something progressive to say on the subject which might console his worthy friend and “could not fail” to promote his development.
0x2d35db03035dc420fdc63589c0504e7e179f39de “there is some sort of festivity being prepared at that... at the widow’s, isn’t there?”
0x57832f418a16831f8ebe99cc7731f7e974ca9f31 pyotr petrovitch asked suddenly, interrupting andrey semyonovitch at the most interesting passage.
0x226c27bc4315d578d9a98f67c44262cd6dea5d7c “why, don’t you know?
0x0de4d6751b97eb0e0e2518bfc10f598bc30ab1f9 why, i was telling you last night what i think about all such ceremonies.
0xc2da27cc2c094e26b893dd5fd2f3d3337935d4b2 and she invited you too, i heard.
0x6cfae06c6a65196588a0300a0ca20b34ec091aec you were talking to her yesterday...” “i should never have expected that beggarly fool would have spent on this feast all the money she got from that other fool, raskolnikov.
0x5f5b35a48b02e8b2c5a9f62bab4d5634a699541a i was surprised just now as i came through at the preparations there, the wines!
0xfe0a1f629bb01553f8cbb09c9da3b859401cce80 several people are invited.
0x319a1639e444f3a86d89908570ccb99583886114 it’s beyond everything!”
0xf57cd2af2d8228feed43f7a519273b7940b1e1c9 continued pyotr petrovitch, who seemed to have some object in pursuing the conversation.
0xd925ce5fccd34b0b9314565227fa1f35fbe7007c “what?
0x8753e6bc3f739188faeb5b43958563cd55b1b89b you say i am asked too?
0xe73e697dcd6bf2b7871c9cc89dfd4ebcde4718c3 when was that?
0x06956ab7acaa21867c53f4960ffd9984387f1c59 i don’t remember.
0xc4d1c092bf09322ad805ede8bdb5142d74ec973a but i shan’t go.
0xccdd8871dd34dd342ad4bb35b546502f45d3becf why should i?
0x1665e102b00f26a95c65e3887593ca1c7b1059fe i only said a word to her in passing yesterday of the possibility of her obtaining a year’s salary as a destitute widow of a government clerk.
0xdcd27cb1ac54a3267d574a30b0111bc0f74969c9 i suppose she has invited me on that account, hasn’t she?
0x5bf862ef8d666b48c72bb420176633c9cd4aa56f he-he-he!”
0x61bc5ec9eef2579e1be29b4e1073bc1f57864a88 “i don’t intend to go either,” said lebeziatnikov.
0xb786dcc4fce81dc0c458d6d10111b55f63eb3151 “i should think not, after giving her a thrashing!
0x1069b4c7bc497a236562afbd5ee1b50b5946c617 you might well hesitate, he-he!”
0xfd0ca2ec8ccb78d7fca4beb28bcab3ccde5493ab “who thrashed?
0xcf5d6f345e339e8ae7f122058ca6f56cedb25aff whom?”
0x0833a835115774817ead33d5232d7998c55d2a03 cried lebeziatnikov, flustered and blushing.
0xa809ba5fa23c8b307bb96225b95ea378b3ed0a23 “why, you thrashed katerina ivanovna a month ago.
0xba8c7d139d8e911b606a5b1de1e592c960c24a5a i heard so yesterday... so that’s what your convictions amount to... and the woman question, too, wasn’t quite sound, he-he-he!”
0xe9a6e9566f736e3426ff5b9eb0708bbfefb8d7b7 and pyotr petrovitch, as though comforted, went back to clicking his beads.
0x82157430d8008414cef160ceecd3357908a3120c “it’s all slander and nonsense!”
0xe208589a0eb23a883bf9f98e917426fcf7dbcb24 cried lebeziatnikov, who was always afraid of allusions to the subject.
0xb650202ad234e45da30853f98760aa55b023bad7 “it was not like that at all, it was quite different.
0x5b8cbb7e90b8075c7bedd9a58d82eadcdd362d4a you’ve heard it wrong; it’s a libel.
0xcbf1b2323f337b3b8d663e0de6aeabe375a7478f i was simply defending myself.
0x138db114da5b31c417ece460feb2a971d260f14f she rushed at me first with her nails, she pulled out all my whiskers.... it’s permissable for anyone, i should hope, to defend himself and i never allow anyone to use violence to me on principle, for it’s an act of despotism.
0x443fe53cc8cdeb6681d77e781d068743f9df9605 what was i to do?
0xa2f78cde3dc72130ab1d0f1453766d2376a96b28 i simply pushed her back.”

0xa2efa03e2aaffd63ae097b1df9e1e90582ac3d3b you don’t understand; i used to think, indeed, that if women are equal to men in all respects, even in strength (as is maintained now) there ought to be equality in that, too.
0x7a49c471a5fa0b6159c9dfaa1e0ea234e914d9f8 of course, i reflected afterwards that such a question ought not really to arise, for there ought not to be fighting and in the future society fighting is unthinkable... and that it would be a queer thing to seek for equality in fighting.
0xb9fb7eab96fb52558a8d5209bd9571eae44b45f9 i am not so stupid... though, of course, there is fighting... there won’t be later, but at present there is... confound it!

0xdb56ba429091544e91fcbe1ad69cc1fc9c12fbcb i should do it with a good object.
0x589d99286f3d0d172b8f73accbdcc2dadd56920a i might indirectly assist the cause of enlightenment and propaganda.
0x96d0741a6f8176ed53fcd932d825cd8fc3fb22b8 it’s a duty of every man to work for enlightenment and propaganda and the more harshly, perhaps, the better.

0xd1d3cfdaff89afda9db3641c04a3892d60f04d66 you know, terebyeva (who is in the community now) was blamed because when she left her family and... devoted... herself, she wrote to her father and mother that she wouldn’t go on living conventionally and was entering on a free marriage and it was said that that was too harsh, that she might have spared them and have written more kindly.
0xebf179afb9904c5f50d672892a519854bf1aee5c i think that’s all nonsense and there’s no need of softness; on the contrary, what’s wanted is protest.

0xa7e2451b5944ff584b40b03ea13870ca6f0d9e5d that’s how letters like that ought to be written!”

0xc25fec28ef60b52d369e6e7037ebeb572b734b1b i think, that is, it is my own personal conviction that this is the normal condition of women.

0x207486b71e2311ad8dd15b9a60a6eb19e440999c i mean, _distinguons_.
0x8e6ed7da9e4fdaf8773c5b95a58cdca4b262b20c in our present society it is not altogether normal, because it is compulsory, but in the future society it will be perfectly normal, because it will be voluntary.
0x6391f384a42e8a06c60ab879ddce758474319ccc even as it is, she was quite right: she was suffering and that was her asset, so to speak, her capital which she had a perfect right to dispose of.
0x7574beb18e8f619053d2820ea67b78a6cb17b70a of course, in the future society there will be no need of assets, but her part will have another significance, rational and in harmony with her environment.
0x498816bf6c94e7e9495d79f8f08f8036476ac3b5 as to sofya semyonovna personally, i regard her action as a vigorous protest against the organisation of society, and i respect her deeply for it; i rejoice indeed when i look at her!”
0xf4814b05b077f01d045537f76d6cafda889aa40f “i was told that you got her turned out of these lodgings.”
0x473a30a6bb264cab8ae7a320f3ff32593473394f lebeziatnikov was enraged.
0x7243c5dd08f62de4f216999cda3360c6ba3c08ab “that’s another slander,” he yelled.

0xf7af0d34f150610e5acd1c40350c7370d0eaa5a1 i was simply developing her, entirely disinterestedly, trying to rouse her to protest.... all i wanted was her protest and sofya semyonovna could not have remained here anyway!”
0x01d846ca8b96b83f6763ebbe8c30dd98421809e9 “have you asked her to join your community?”

0x82fce2ec96beb1736308f2c3bcad7b5d96dc3629 the community is established that there should be no such rôles.
0x52f484d1f140c9596c32198c3ae56b3a58efa5ee in a community, such a rôle is essentially transformed and what is stupid here is sensible there, what, under present conditions, is unnatural becomes perfectly natural in the community.
0xb5954ae37246ffa88ac95b9254d7de67f6a5b96c it all depends on the environment.
0xb9e282f9421492afbb334303dd6db11434589431 it’s all the environment and man himself is nothing.
0xea30f32320c23fd283f0720f1f3c203ba4b12a25 and i am on good terms with sofya semyonovna to this day, which is a proof that she never regarded me as having wronged her.

0x7bfcea13bdd587da6cc287c6f04b0a9d5bb39e5c of course if she were to tell me herself that she wanted me, i should think myself very lucky, because i like the girl very much; but as it is, no one has ever treated her more courteously than i, with more respect for her dignity... i wait in hopes, that’s all!”

0x88efc1e85537f0ed0084e73c7d8bf2f7a7b3fb23 you simply despise her.
0xcb7b89570dab4d1dc651baae584b28a73cb6c34e seeing a fact which you mistakenly consider deserving of contempt, you refuse to take a humane view of a fellow creature.
0xa3bb019b8210a00157dc769eb1c0013e82cc5dd4 you don’t know what a character she is!
0x2ef35644fd7ee0fe9952a046cf0d1e9163cc78dc i am only sorry that of late she has quite given up reading and borrowing books.

0xc0cf6f565ad8955c550fb8daa116cbbdd7433c75 i am leaving here to-day or to-morrow and therefore i wanted to speak to her about... however, you may be present during the interview.
0x05ddab51df59969bd5e1be69ba9c10d07209eaae it’s better you should be, indeed.
0xb60158ef48da3982b2665c6f1ed9fed388690e94 for there’s no knowing what you might imagine.”
0xa4a4241f3f3c217282b756947cad7ec062eb945b “i shan’t imagine anything.
0x95044ca869abfabfa1034186e2f385722d1c0bc9 i only asked and, if you’ve anything to say to her, nothing is easier than to call her in.
0xe94fd08b91c506c45f36218bf94ead4a31ad3bb7 i’ll go directly and you may be sure i won’t be in your way.”
0x0ae3e8b4de04f4819d6856f01f95c688606586a7 five minutes later lebeziatnikov came in with sonia.
0x1aa30a158838fa9e01e7584389d1bc0f085f13a4 she came in very much surprised and overcome with shyness as usual.
0x810e942e0b8a7758eb476e8b93ebc7ffde4b2caa she was always shy in such circumstances and was always afraid of new people, she had been as a child and was even more so now.... pyotr petrovitch met her “politely and affably,” but with a certain shade of bantering familiarity which in his opinion was suitable for a man of his respectability and weight in dealing with a creature so young and so _interesting_ as she.
0xe01f017ec2beb27c5b7ee48f962c203df7cd0c49 he hastened to “reassure” her and made her sit down facing him at the table.
0xeec6cd737fb9c815e6a762e22ac805bf0af90df9 sonia sat down, looked about her--at lebeziatnikov, at the notes lying on the table and then again at pyotr petrovitch and her eyes remained riveted on him.
0x56365ef0242ae0a0cb1baf7538e4bc71725f8dd3 lebeziatnikov was moving to the door.
0xd76cfaa055753c512f939425d22ed3f26942543e pyotr petrovitch signed to sonia to remain seated and stopped lebeziatnikov.
0x31fae6f954f2e041f8f1b3ad829ebbcad93437bb “is raskolnikov in there?
0x5e4d4fc6c9e134c6d6db450be8c48cd60f40686e has he come?”
0x3a60b84c335990a8213d98472c2d4a6252bba705 he asked him in a whisper.
0xe310482509a8d823b460925d0fc0c903603af88c “raskolnikov?
0x62e7d96e6ce26488e9c8e5635892d58e637a56dc yes.
0xc1d2a529e188ba52f8833b3cc9e41eb29f30b41e why?
0x32251f701555c3e4159d5a265d0f25d206073c80 yes, he is there.
0xc8e65d97a943ed3bdcd3635effa71326e96e4304 i saw him just come in.... why?”
0xddddc1f3c2d2163247166aecae6d4621efacf058 “well, i particularly beg you to remain here with us and not to leave me alone with this... young woman.
0x5683589ee76fbbd9d47b2b1dbdb95d501b1cee6c i only want a few words with her, but god knows what they may make of it.
0x516dd7dd16c97f1bc503d57eb3e8d78897f8c6f7 i shouldn’t like raskolnikov to repeat anything.... you understand what i mean?”
0x71da1606fffacc907e798042b68f2ed693d84747 “i understand!”
0xddd23e3399ab773ff0cabff9ec86622cda8cdb62 lebeziatnikov saw the point.
0x3345e1ae1ea3281f4cb6248c82459d570aee2c8c “yes, you are right.... of course, i am convinced personally that you have no reason to be uneasy, but... still, you are right.
0x82fd165f5239cb50e9dc058391be93932640dc50 certainly i’ll stay.
0xad431a2a31e9d2f33a9ef1b20291549321fad11f i’ll stand here at the window and not be in your way... i think you are right...” pyotr petrovitch returned to the sofa, sat down opposite sonia, looked attentively at her and assumed an extremely dignified, even severe expression, as much as to say, “don’t you make any mistake, madam.”
0x371b661fea28c61f264bc68a8f2d0d6be0447520 sonia was overwhelmed with embarrassment.
0x2899e174852b5f4167d724bc958fdac66180ba3b “in the first place, sofya semyonovna, will you make my excuses to your respected mamma.... that’s right, isn’t it?
0x272be321a5ecb5ec799605db4260d0a0ed725cc1 katerina ivanovna stands in the place of a mother to you?”
0xe17957ae9310a25473a5aeef7c7482ebd1a07494 pyotr petrovitch began with great dignity, though affably.
0x95572bd861ce26e90aa20667bbfd29e4ac48e136 it was evident that his intentions were friendly.
0x8121345d9e7b321c58dc37bb458da134a61cdb17 “quite so, yes; the place of a mother,” sonia answered, timidly and hurriedly.
0xc921e3c6f5b202f8aa36ebb830f5c8a2f5dfd58e “then will you make my apologies to her?
0x6916428aeb7bd5b11df9f6c2b0f68e32898c9b61 through inevitable circumstances i am forced to be absent and shall not be at the dinner in spite of your mamma’s kind invitation.”
0x21845123b7bcd8e1d64323869ee85e252c0ce6a9 “yes... i’ll tell her... at once.”
0x5fdf7483b229c5f4f2d3bb831639d378fdceb1ca and sonia hastily jumped up from her seat.
0x885769e22ee5674eaa6e86702d94977f2c002fec “wait, that’s not all,” pyotr petrovitch detained her, smiling at her simplicity and ignorance of good manners, “and you know me little, my dear sofya semyonovna, if you suppose i would have ventured to trouble a person like you for a matter of so little consequence affecting myself only.
0x1ca6e27fc3633277dc259314cc3cbd9d9b642ef7 i have another object.”
0x4efd47b3aa96e939eba8bfc8a9a697743c006c41 sonia sat down hurriedly.
0x3cba5b1e1c6ada44d839a56d47fc68a4710bb1f1 her eyes rested again for an instant on the grey-and-rainbow-coloured notes that remained on the table, but she quickly looked away and fixed her eyes on pyotr petrovitch.
0xcc2e116f17dc9a744c9646fcc85b6504ef8cf1c4 she felt it horribly indecorous, especially for _her_, to look at another person’s money.
0xcfd87d9b221804085ae28e284a1d024ce07f4eba she stared at the gold eye-glass which pyotr petrovitch held in his left hand and at the massive and extremely handsome ring with a yellow stone on his middle finger.
0xd24aeccb91b01a144511807eb6ccee44982ef77a but suddenly she looked away and, not knowing where to turn, ended by staring pyotr petrovitch again straight in the face.
0x85e2309fb2ee06c2ed2debe20fa6f08c6a8b28ff after a pause of still greater dignity he continued.
0x81dfaeb2c1d92883c94d8b6b38e40d9198da0c6b “i chanced yesterday in passing to exchange a couple of words with katerina ivanovna, poor woman.
0x90f395a57fa35a90110e53c784b1e4c23039b153 that was sufficient to enable me to ascertain that she is in a position--preternatural, if one may so express it.”
0xf2e7b0176ee48386e4092a819ccf525948646368 “yes... preternatural...” sonia hurriedly assented.
0x67e51a65c6c311f2fb4f0b189caa594d05b6d83c “or it would be simpler and more comprehensible to say, ill.”
0x092234d293d4a5f3dda82b318a34264e7824127b “yes, simpler and more comprehen... yes, ill.”
0x4e54f2d1a0514f9208cb6882d190a04bfceb7068 “quite so.
0x70ef3917b8e50412b0a816c96402a6d054948cc6 so then from a feeling of humanity and so to speak compassion, i should be glad to be of service to her in any way, foreseeing her unfortunate position.
0x0e5f924a0f019adcc7003100876f4b92abbe33c1 i believe the whole of this poverty-stricken family depends now entirely on you?”
0x492678e561b58772960ad91a4cda198945dbf320 “allow me to ask,” sonia rose to her feet, “did you say something to her yesterday of the possibility of a pension?
0x113a56728722cde8fa9eef61da0e5a7dfdf91ae9 because she told me you had undertaken to get her one.
0x971bc0c6111752fede435aeb6459e1c7e13da097 was that true?”
0x2867c43e55e287b4d5681d7a30809141f286afca “not in the slightest, and indeed it’s an absurdity!
0x8e644d0a6f622b599e6e26cb304d161d670d876e i merely hinted at her obtaining temporary assistance as the widow of an official who had died in the service--if only she has patronage... but apparently your late parent had not served his full term and had not indeed been in the service at all of late.
0xb9a8340e5dc6a1fd710cc4eb99f46070c9604e84 in fact, if there could be any hope, it would be very ephemeral, because there would be no claim for assistance in that case, far from it.... and she is dreaming of a pension already, he-he-he!... a go-ahead lady!”
0x9d58d9365b02264734ed2f13cb251fa088b5aaae “yes, she is.
0x5591679cc41c41a7427e6cfd04649f1363e18d4e for she is credulous and good-hearted, and she believes everything from the goodness of her heart and... and... and she is like that... yes... you must excuse her,” said sonia, and again she got up to go.
0x636c1c65918ff3cd17d758103570adb1091f634d “but you haven’t heard what i have to say.”
0x96cce014a17dbf78236f41c79607dc34f16de6ad “no, i haven’t heard,” muttered sonia.
0xa8a10939349c56f2ac96041082c6771def00bd98 “then sit down.”
0x154f0efd7cd26d1a624df122eba9d6f63ff5e2e3 she was terribly confused; she sat down again a third time.
0xb0815bf8743549c28ff08f5063a6de6ba358f66d “seeing her position with her unfortunate little ones, i should be glad, as i have said before, so far as lies in my power, to be of service, that is, so far as is in my power, not more.
0x79847422981d9930285344e0586080a086c097ea one might for instance get up a subscription for her, or a lottery, something of the sort, such as is always arranged in such cases by friends or even outsiders desirous of assisting people.
0x45076421138b0ac689e698c4006b4dc641a3c005 it was of that i intended to speak to you; it might be done.”
0x0de54252b8f1ee9892797b5875bf0674d3857600 “yes, yes... god will repay you for it,” faltered sonia, gazing intently at pyotr petrovitch.
0x9abe2af26a6420c9ccc71e784fc62b359184da26 “it might be, but we will talk of it later.
0x6aef144baef62b83783714f639caa9093e7544eb we might begin it to-day, we will talk it over this evening and lay the foundation so to speak.
0xef96782c5b9bc038b1945b1b910355cbf59e6cf3 come to me at seven o’clock.
0xd53e2cbcd413c8d9aea4dd3c27dfd5858205f549 mr. lebeziatnikov, i hope, will assist us.
0x9d7ffe102ad0bfa243553e98534071f6df572f64 but there is one circumstance of which i ought to warn you beforehand and for which i venture to trouble you, sofya semyonovna, to come here.
0x1bdb8c868b9f8dc3bf96f2c11d718d7f5a90ae68 in my opinion money cannot be, indeed it’s unsafe to put it into katerina ivanovna’s own hands.
0xd4f0488ea638c1e04b1b7b483d152e9cda7de808 the dinner to-day is a proof of that.
0xa02e340bffb009c3fdd4008d2063f2bb51bf2baf though she has not, so to speak, a crust of bread for to-morrow and... well, boots or shoes, or anything; she has bought to-day jamaica rum, and even, i believe, madeira and... and coffee.
0x3ea3c2407ac02adff826f50f3c1d6d02c06aacf5 i saw it as i passed through.
0x16698094122ca554c25cc9791174238e9532474a to-morrow it will all fall upon you again, they won’t have a crust of bread.
0xa896e8f86901eaeb9f40a7dfe727050302cf9f5e it’s absurd, really, and so, to my thinking, a subscription ought to be raised so that the unhappy widow should not know of the money, but only you, for instance.
0x4237b7b246112ef73b9c71e7b169ba5392b1b776 am i right?”
0x1313a805931c913e4341d3a1620c9558758756c7 “i don’t know... this is only to-day, once in her life.... she was so anxious to do honour, to celebrate the memory.... and she is very sensible... but just as you think and i shall be very, very... they will all be... and god will reward... and the orphans...” sonia burst into tears.
0x709dde03d0b624589cbb934a6114ac42c1104323 “very well, then, keep it in mind; and now will you accept for the benefit of your relation the small sum that i am able to spare, from me personally.
0x65bb13e91b40d8f3c61666410dce03c3b3abad8f i am very anxious that my name should not be mentioned in connection with it.
0x17c1118e3f4dd0286f45b94d69b30885e903bb3b here... having so to speak anxieties of my own, i cannot do more...” and pyotr petrovitch held out to sonia a ten-rouble note carefully unfolded.
0x759c7b37b03e0ebdc0068e19fd3f1c09082d0990 sonia took it, flushed crimson, jumped up, muttered something and began taking leave.
0x420c2aebed3bf781e6f849ac1de323e166750556 pyotr petrovitch accompanied her ceremoniously to the door.
0xc445b4ffe6efa1b59bd19435b646de9b810dc5e3 she got out of the room at last, agitated and distressed, and returned to katerina ivanovna, overwhelmed with confusion.
0x748a8dcf9e61543f96eaa552df37acae1b668e55 all this time lebeziatnikov had stood at the window or walked about the room, anxious not to interrupt the conversation; when sonia had gone he walked up to pyotr petrovitch and solemnly held out his hand.
0xfde27ce8989ea2e2dcdf40cba59c549d3e3ab9c3 “i heard and _saw_ everything,” he said, laying stress on the last verb.
0xca26451955c4ce76554a52fdefba1c2df544daff “that is honourable, i mean to say, it’s humane!
0xa1e215aa51fcf11dfb0f415eb8fddde85202e93c you wanted to avoid gratitude, i saw!
0x1ac26abd7772468f453423d0748562d6f5f9d901 and although i cannot, i confess, in principle sympathise with private charity, for it not only fails to eradicate the evil but even promotes it, yet i must admit that i saw your action with pleasure--yes, yes, i like it.”
0x1b16a14bfe32ea6d41fff20110f0062b04ec1443 “that’s all nonsense,” muttered pyotr petrovitch, somewhat disconcerted, looking carefully at lebeziatnikov.
0x295e0f12175f0ce6f8a8dc00e4010b9945a5087f “no, it’s not nonsense!
0x0fa6ded7faf4d230bf54f04e3ac442515022b184 a man who has suffered distress and annoyance as you did yesterday and who yet can sympathise with the misery of others, such a man... even though he is making a social mistake--is still deserving of respect!
0x8df30c55feac80b1c97b15471a6444bb637bc157 i did not expect it indeed of you, pyotr petrovitch, especially as according to your ideas... oh, what a drawback your ideas are to you!
0xb3cd386d8e3a2c315abe306c3137b8f1ea785ca3 how distressed you are for instance by your ill-luck yesterday,” cried the simple-hearted lebeziatnikov, who felt a return of affection for pyotr petrovitch.
0xd879c88c6c497888b868b6059cbabdc13a28af64 “and, what do you want with marriage, with _legal_ marriage, my dear, noble pyotr petrovitch?
0x885ee959a5a4531100aa09d86f948f50fe29e330 why do you cling to this _legality_ of marriage?
0x969442af13dcdcfcea10088033ed596036252e49 well, you may beat me if you like, but i am glad, positively glad it hasn’t come off, that you are free, that you are not quite lost for humanity.... you see, i’ve spoken my mind!”
0x49f0dfc7384c8be03e9fe1ac1af8b8d6da3521fd “because i don’t want in your free marriage to be made a fool of and to bring up another man’s children, that’s why i want legal marriage,” luzhin replied in order to make some answer.
0x96eea8656eedf1fd1e3ec9ed8aba55ecc43ccc2a he seemed preoccupied by something.
0xbaa0a3b1055c4862be939a256fbb7f7446c3f6f0 “children?
0x5a07d8414fbacc9093435cb995a15db0a4b9c8a0 you referred to children,” lebeziatnikov started off like a warhorse at the trumpet call.
0x5bb27a6a6e0b988b89d137eb34ebdd02bbacb2f1 “children are a social question and a question of first importance, i agree; but the question of children has another solution.
0x495ed4a7c21c51a93a451e4c736e4fa6e55bfa81 some refuse to have children altogether, because they suggest the institution of the family.
0x0d7ccbb8a5c9112f50f51bc5d15c444a19c7176a we’ll speak of children later, but now as to the question of honour, i confess that’s my weak point.
0x559f059afdbb9b626591eeb12e94333feac6aa74 that horrid, military, pushkin expression is unthinkable in the dictionary of the future.
0xa9502e7d9d35bf7b07c0431b4a8140c7a29aea43 what does it mean indeed?
0x6e0e6766c4b27838d82c78874edd9b19d85306b1 it’s nonsense, there will be no deception in a free marriage!
0xa9e00045468d4854c8304a7bfbbbad25b8287bd5 that is only the natural consequence of a legal marriage, so to say, its corrective, a protest.
0x26b24688a125c1b3faa94d78095ca8ae71f44b23 so that indeed it’s not humiliating... and if i ever, to suppose an absurdity, were to be legally married, i should be positively glad of it.
0x4ba5d05475cdf0475cd84f649722e79e89040233 i should say to my wife: ‘my dear, hitherto i have loved you, now i respect you, for you’ve shown you can protest!’
0xef43e6bd269299748b26f9b82cbf61ca85ab5bd5 you laugh!
0xf8716f2f2da88887130833bdd5cfc3484f6e1d4a that’s because you are incapable of getting away from prejudices.
0x44ba4155c2bfad1210c5c5a9a9e93bb296171c7e confound it all!
0x9d765669c1a0456751df62de8b8d1d6ac836b1ef i understand now where the unpleasantness is of being deceived in a legal marriage, but it’s simply a despicable consequence of a despicable position in which both are humiliated.
0xeaa08dad5cdc5074e61bba01909ccd3ab46e82d7 when the deception is open, as in a free marriage, then it does not exist, it’s unthinkable.
0x5df4a5b799230bd366ec41c3f7a3632e63011671 your wife will only prove how she respects you by considering you incapable of opposing her happiness and avenging yourself on her for her new husband.
0x43d19339b864140b3e998602a480324835a5dadd damn it all!
0x62271c9f5f5152133a63da2d99324498e5466ae5 i sometimes dream if i were to be married, pfoo!
0xefe267f5fd7e93f2e5f79562bbf5528fb7d2db68 i mean if i were to marry, legally or not, it’s just the same, i should present my wife with a lover if she had not found one for herself.
0x97f33e3e9fff72cb043b1004135bd56dd25bc667 ‘my dear,’ i should say, ‘i love you, but even more than that i desire you to respect me.
0x8e576c37f33467f5b5ef3c13f3da826632b73fb9 see!’
0xbcbe757e0e207f8ace8f673902c9b16e354d54e0 am i not right?”
0xc3aa5318add934d04cf3e2f5930519f09049c80c pyotr petrovitch sniggered as he listened, but without much merriment.
0x67546db221d892c9e1093dcdc59e65fe7cada402 he hardly heard it indeed.
0x6f3824c455c1131be803a6e73b53c0e5d7f4862b he was preoccupied with something else and even lebeziatnikov at last noticed it.
0x824e69dfc51908f228407d0f8622dbf4ff72f825 pyotr petrovitch seemed excited and rubbed his hands.
0xd57783894b07ed9940e7a63b57ffb38d2c313968 lebeziatnikov remembered all this and reflected upon it afterwards.
0x4f5dd0ce8162e4c098a469f4205bc73b18903461 chapter ii it would be difficult to explain exactly what could have originated the idea of that senseless dinner in katerina ivanovna’s disordered brain.
0xcc90ba8d3628985a1fb31fb4a134ccdd98874fed nearly ten of the twenty roubles, given by raskolnikov for marmeladov’s funeral, were wasted upon it.
0xe72fc5265b994803d2bc7cd5be8ef2c5d740cc75 possibly katerina ivanovna felt obliged to honour the memory of the deceased “suitably,” that all the lodgers, and still more amalia ivanovna, might know “that he was in no way their inferior, and perhaps very much their superior,” and that no one had the right “to turn up his nose at him.”
0x231162dd9f5690d54f495f6ec4f582c6de864835 perhaps the chief element was that peculiar “poor man’s pride,” which compels many poor people to spend their last savings on some traditional social ceremony, simply in order to do “like other people,” and not to “be looked down upon.”
0xc879f1255b7356fdf148cae5d91d191845115425 it is very probable, too, that katerina ivanovna longed on this occasion, at the moment when she seemed to be abandoned by everyone, to show those “wretched contemptible lodgers” that she knew “how to do things, how to entertain” and that she had been brought up “in a genteel, she might almost say aristocratic colonel’s family” and had not been meant for sweeping floors and washing the children’s rags at night.
0x24a196cf8035ff83e6f3b47e5cfafbd258a541e1 even the poorest and most broken-spirited people are sometimes liable to these paroxysms of pride and vanity which take the form of an irresistible nervous craving.
0x831c75720d163e19c6a44954b1dc3affac1f9152 and katerina ivanovna was not broken-spirited; she might have been killed by circumstance, but her spirit could not have been broken, that is, she could not have been intimidated, her will could not be crushed.
0xe6ca55d97b3ae474ca7b57aad3511ecc8e41f6c9 moreover sonia had said with good reason that her mind was unhinged.
0x1f8c708c04eefa78a6490e660bb79b42b8cdde0b she could not be said to be insane, but for a year past she had been so harassed that her mind might well be overstrained.
0x78069c417cfd9275b0a4bcac9a5fce1fea998050 the later stages of consumption are apt, doctors tell us, to affect the intellect.
0x6419401f1a07230c720c840e54ad28bc8e71b60b there was no great variety of wines, nor was there madeira; but wine there was.
0x8c10c7c9db84118c38e21f4eb652c27c912004cf there was vodka, rum and lisbon wine, all of the poorest quality but in sufficient quantity.
0x6d0bdb7cd23b84ec809f0035148386515c134d81 besides the traditional rice and honey, there were three or four dishes, one of which consisted of pancakes, all prepared in amalia ivanovna’s kitchen.
0xa0171257279ccc6b2ef32213fae2f1547d241257 two samovars were boiling, that tea and punch might be offered after dinner.
0x8621f95fb135218459d0ff8ffefe9cbbc5652a84 katerina ivanovna had herself seen to purchasing the provisions, with the help of one of the lodgers, an unfortunate little pole who had somehow been stranded at madame lippevechsel’s.
0x69c3f392aca760138a66a0c59a260d8b3cd61413 he promptly put himself at katerina ivanovna’s disposal and had been all that morning and all the day before running about as fast as his legs could carry him, and very anxious that everyone should be aware of it.
0xcbb699fe75484ff2b1f1e3968c4f9586c86a68af for every trifle he ran to katerina ivanovna, even hunting her out at the bazaar, at every instant called her “_pani_.”
0x3cfcbdec95cb425013b156a68c129a5b04e05556 she was heartily sick of him before the end, though she had declared at first that she could not have got on without this “serviceable and magnanimous man.”
0xc1ccd5783f39a47a38e5f02dba20fecc543a47b6 it was one of katerina ivanovna’s characteristics to paint everyone she met in the most glowing colours.
0x86715126f31c173f779009e91444398ab5fa25b2 her praises were so exaggerated as sometimes to be embarrassing; she would invent various circumstances to the credit of her new acquaintance and quite genuinely believe in their reality.
0x86fbc8bffbda6a70746c38d9d15fd3c4c5d8870f then all of a sudden she would be disillusioned and would rudely and contemptuously repulse the person she had only a few hours before been literally adoring.
0xcd97a9c7b5969a387308eab8bb86e0048854d9aa she was naturally of a gay, lively and peace-loving disposition, but from continual failures and misfortunes she had come to desire so _keenly_ that all should live in peace and joy and should not _dare_ to break the peace, that the slightest jar, the smallest disaster reduced her almost to frenzy, and she would pass in an instant from the brightest hopes and fancies to cursing her fate and raving, and knocking her head against the wall.
0x2b78f56337dc0031daa6b5ef2d4a2bf236ebbd86 amalia ivanovna, too, suddenly acquired extraordinary importance in katerina ivanovna’s eyes and was treated by her with extraordinary respect, probably only because amalia ivanovna had thrown herself heart and soul into the preparations.
0x9a979d9c518cf060a204c68d118a80438c42df9c she had undertaken to lay the table, to provide the linen, crockery, etc., and to cook the dishes in her kitchen, and katerina ivanovna had left it all in her hands and gone herself to the cemetery.
0x659fc76165e52edcf950d66f0c0e3f303756ef3e everything had been well done.
0x2fdf12fc640d260c9316aefc4ee471651f407aef even the table-cloth was nearly clean; the crockery, knives, forks and glasses were, of course, of all shapes and patterns, lent by different lodgers, but the table was properly laid at the time fixed, and amalia ivanovna, feeling she had done her work well, had put on a black silk dress and a cap with new mourning ribbons and met the returning party with some pride.
0x8e81a96128fe4711e12fd7b3da6dba2fe53d807c this pride, though justifiable, displeased katerina ivanovna for some reason: “as though the table could not have been laid except by amalia ivanovna!”
0x2e7283d8022688e68b61d31baca968c49d4d91e7 she disliked the cap with new ribbons, too.
0x04e8a21d1fd6433a5fa3cce80a099520a2f44375 “could she be stuck up, the stupid german, because she was mistress of the house, and had consented as a favour to help her poor lodgers!
0x47cc753116e1116839fbc8fa04455c16c1f361d7 as a favour!
0xf4e9b3d579074faab272494036cf230abe4d333a fancy that!
0x990f251e49430e912157917ab3f508502a933cd4 katerina ivanovna’s father who had been a colonel and almost a governor had sometimes had the table set for forty persons, and then anyone like amalia ivanovna, or rather ludwigovna, would not have been allowed into the kitchen.”
0x0056cdcb5a81b79c2d8498924274ef447e1755ba katerina ivanovna, however, put off expressing her feelings for the time and contented herself with treating her coldly, though she decided inwardly that she would certainly have to put amalia ivanovna down and set her in her proper place, for goodness only knew what she was fancying herself.
0x8af734ada77b813404ede8bb3845d7d7cbc615a1 katerina ivanovna was irritated too by the fact that hardly any of the lodgers invited had come to the funeral, except the pole who had just managed to run into the cemetery, while to the memorial dinner the poorest and most insignificant of them had turned up, the wretched creatures, many of them not quite sober.
0x5bfbcf09699810cb9baa67ced898a0b39bb662f3 the older and more respectable of them all, as if by common consent, stayed away.
0xac1f135d4cf3a9dd3195632e249f78f70447e0f3 pyotr petrovitch luzhin, for instance, who might be said to be the most respectable of all the lodgers, did not appear, though katerina ivanovna had the evening before told all the world, that is amalia ivanovna, polenka, sonia and the pole, that he was the most generous, noble-hearted man with a large property and vast connections, who had been a friend of her first husband’s, and a guest in her father’s house, and that he had promised to use all his influence to secure her a considerable pension.
0x0c65b016c60a6d80aa765ab4dc812b6aa5d9fdb1 it must be noted that when katerina ivanovna exalted anyone’s connections and fortune, it was without any ulterior motive, quite disinterestedly, for the mere pleasure of adding to the consequence of the person praised.
0xb372acd8a8a44bc5ab6e7a2cd5e9662e7de80573 probably “taking his cue” from luzhin, “that contemptible wretch lebeziatnikov had not turned up either.
0x12662390e3cd49eb37badf7ffbf2eddc18d2ae57 what did he fancy himself?
0x26445f5063c9c7c586a6dbb86ba82e6910f03226 he was only asked out of kindness and because he was sharing the same room with pyotr petrovitch and was a friend of his, so that it would have been awkward not to invite him.”
0x93356cf21b77ea9838fa10ee04d4ae97c0c7fc12 among those who failed to appear were “the genteel lady and her old-maidish daughter,” who had only been lodgers in the house for the last fortnight, but had several times complained of the noise and uproar in katerina ivanovna’s room, especially when marmeladov had come back drunk.
0xd2a1e2703aabf2af5b3b6a1820d7c030ac6527ae katerina ivanovna heard this from amalia ivanovna who, quarrelling with katerina ivanovna, and threatening to turn the whole family out of doors, had shouted at her that they “were not worth the foot” of the honourable lodgers whom they were disturbing.
0xc6d23ae52d03f7adc1ce6b0d2df73a4fa5d18fb6 katerina ivanovna determined now to invite this lady and her daughter, “whose foot she was not worth,” and who had turned away haughtily when she casually met them, so that they might know that “she was more noble in her thoughts and feelings and did not harbour malice,” and might see that she was not accustomed to her way of living.
0x7eeada4c20801f7798a47f434fcd8a6c0ea19c6f she had proposed to make this clear to them at dinner with allusions to her late father’s governorship, and also at the same time to hint that it was exceedingly stupid of them to turn away on meeting her.
0xda158e507a5db76e993bcda2e50855e8f78f87fc the fat colonel-major (he was really a discharged officer of low rank) was also absent, but it appeared that he had been “not himself” for the last two days.
0x1e07f5c56650e27c464b601e439fa08e195cc77b the party consisted of the pole, a wretched looking clerk with a spotty face and a greasy coat, who had not a word to say for himself, and smelt abominably, a deaf and almost blind old man who had once been in the post office and who had been from immemorial ages maintained by someone at amalia ivanovna’s.
0x2a40ebe807a10e84802191070d16428eb874ccb4 a retired clerk of the commissariat department came, too; he was drunk, had a loud and most unseemly laugh and only fancy--was without a waistcoat!
0x5f5f381346a8797cea9f492bc7af8667d74866b3 one of the visitors sat straight down to the table without even greeting katerina ivanovna.
0xd86007baac5c02329567f6ddd489e215ecf5efb8 finally one person having no suit appeared in his dressing-gown, but this was too much, and the efforts of amalia ivanovna and the pole succeeded in removing him.
0xbe249d610827a21a3aaa174b6c0510fd05ff68ec the pole brought with him, however, two other poles who did not live at amalia ivanovna’s and whom no one had seen here before.
0x4dc3c397d9d7c6bd240c83b532f1a24c6ef7ea49 all this irritated katerina ivanovna intensely.
0x2f433749e5e3f0ecc9987f8e1367cd55321c2836 “for whom had they made all these preparations then?”
0x2fe73b764118197cb010b2c1a4a3120d7847b2a6 to make room for the visitors the children had not even been laid for at the table; but the two little ones were sitting on a bench in the furthest corner with their dinner laid on a box, while polenka as a big girl had to look after them, feed them, and keep their noses wiped like well-bred children’s.
0x5115917d094b7f6054f4aacba772704c6a1fbfef katerina ivanovna, in fact, could hardly help meeting her guests with increased dignity, and even haughtiness.
0x5116eecce012f3ae41ce873f0e27f091b4665458 she stared at some of them with special severity, and loftily invited them to take their seats.
0x52db38105a10a125a38f80de32c9a30058045d53 rushing to the conclusion that amalia ivanovna must be responsible for those who were absent, she began treating her with extreme nonchalance, which the latter promptly observed and resented.
0x6ef1d889999433569579a75df412f1735f22d5c4 such a beginning was no good omen for the end.
0x4b864da87cbc4ea0c627dfd41b1d4792e27ac4d2 all were seated at last.
0xb13dd5bea618997cb12ddedb38952a525531b3e4 raskolnikov came in almost at the moment of their return from the cemetery.
0xc38248a60873c51a2c4f6b5dd4e6ba764b854811 katerina ivanovna was greatly delighted to see him, in the first place, because he was the one “educated visitor, and, as everyone knew, was in two years to take a professorship in the university,” and secondly because he immediately and respectfully apologised for having been unable to be at the funeral.
0x6d9ffc00f3f8e8cf75146074c7418b57e0d51c43 she positively pounced upon him, and made him sit on her left hand (amalia ivanovna was on her right).
0x783472350a80811de1828ebe1f34a36eb94d3225 in spite of her continual anxiety that the dishes should be passed round correctly and that everyone should taste them, in spite of the agonising cough which interrupted her every minute and seemed to have grown worse during the last few days, she hastened to pour out in a half whisper to raskolnikov all her suppressed feelings and her just indignation at the failure of the dinner, interspersing her remarks with lively and uncontrollable laughter at the expense of her visitors and especially of her landlady.
0xb595cf3d018cbe7a242f4f600c9bc644c753fb49 “it’s all that cuckoo’s fault!
0x1558bcabaf220f24960b7a5d05c3fb8f3383c44a you know whom i mean?

0xad6de78501a5caa1e836965a06091aa88dfd6af5 katerina ivanovna nodded towards the landlady.
0x1874bea2e2e767ee82fb02ce4504d4f3f6092397 “look at her, she’s making round eyes, she feels that we are talking about her and can’t understand.

0x8db66d6c40031de2dea450a674a716f6fce91080 she cried suddenly to one of them, “have you tasted the pancakes?

0x8144a6fc9e30b8bc0b02977b95b36621a4da86e3 she addressed her suddenly, almost aloud, “if your spoons should happen to be stolen, i won’t be responsible, i warn you!

0x11ebe352d47414665a4119b09a2d12951ef45bd3 she laughed turning to raskolnikov, and again nodding towards the landlady, in high glee at her sally.

0x5e6bd168047f0422dc35f9a02c55252b210df980 here her laugh turned again to an insufferable fit of coughing that lasted five minutes.
0xec0d4af8c38cc8d7848de4201c84d0ee58cf236a drops of perspiration stood out on her forehead and her handkerchief was stained with blood.
0xa29d7e27630386840a01b3dc0ba84ca7529c1015 she showed raskolnikov the blood in silence, and as soon as she could get her breath began whispering to him again with extreme animation and a hectic flush on her cheeks.

0x60421538e5a5e1b539ed28607f3f4ec40907dba9 sonia knew that this would comfort katerina ivanovna, would flatter her and gratify her pride.
0x62fa51f328633350fc799004cf2d6545269e9330 she sat down beside raskolnikov; she made him a hurried bow, glancing curiously at him.
0x5f36769975ba1d6b4dfdc40b74c83392da331703 but for the rest of the time she seemed to avoid looking at him or speaking to him.
0x366715f55df30186a4932ab190801e54cd2a0142 she seemed absent-minded, though she kept looking at katerina ivanovna, trying to please her.
0xd2be740c4a17e0eca99f0dbb61af49ffae9f46c6 neither she nor katerina ivanovna had been able to get mourning; sonia was wearing dark brown, and katerina ivanovna had on her only dress, a dark striped cotton one.
0x29561580336f216af741467395b996ac374f1c8a the message from pyotr petrovitch was very successful.
0xb051b4efc37dda45c9e9ec1925c2fb7785852bcd listening to sonia with dignity, katerina ivanovna inquired with equal dignity how pyotr petrovitch was, then at once whispered almost aloud to raskolnikov that it certainly would have been strange for a man of pyotr petrovitch’s position and standing to find himself in such “extraordinary company,” in spite of his devotion to her family and his old friendship with her father.
0x6b7d7e29f4ce36dde0d79c4f7352d672056c22ac “that’s why i am so grateful to you, rodion romanovitch, that you have not disdained my hospitality, even in such surroundings,” she added almost aloud.
0xaa23f652afd89429502d82f0530a946e7a42dda6 “but i am sure that it was only your special affection for my poor husband that has made you keep your promise.”
0x47ff0c42cd1239c7281bf0bbbf971a190d07c02a then once more with pride and dignity she scanned her visitors, and suddenly inquired aloud across the table of the deaf man: “wouldn’t he have some more meat, and had he been given some wine?”
0x1ee3300a6628ee6e33666e1e79c76c64ff7e8cef the old man made no answer and for a long while could not understand what he was asked, though his neighbours amused themselves by poking and shaking him.
0x89d7fcf8c74d655850e1045c041d79295b07430c he simply gazed about him with his mouth open, which only increased the general mirth.
0x24093f3d7a09850758d43e7855c7ad90b47ad503 “what an imbecile!
0x00b4cbf4cdc55bce348a043daf27944ced1da5ef look, look!
0xa0abfd2e67315229cf1350a5c8af0768e3dc1932 why was he brought?
0x4fc49c9ce877694207715f9d5bd2d3f7c6e144ea but as to pyotr petrovitch, i always had confidence in him,” katerina ivanovna continued, “and, of course, he is not like...” with an extremely stern face she addressed amalia ivanovna so sharply and loudly that the latter was quite disconcerted, “not like your dressed up draggletails whom my father would not have taken as cooks into his kitchen, and my late husband would have done them honour if he had invited them in the goodness of his heart.”
0xc0a234ce717b296ed29bb8b7efb02bd15d7b209c “yes, he was fond of drink, he was fond of it, he did drink!”
0xb0c8ec8797acaaf4f56618b3f944ae030f66fb72 cried the commissariat clerk, gulping down his twelfth glass of vodka.
0xa5a70c76ccf548597898fb1ed99b33fd07b72cb8 “my late husband certainly had that weakness, and everyone knows it,” katerina ivanovna attacked him at once, “but he was a kind and honourable man, who loved and respected his family.
0x3d78d46169164f33c4f1a994b40fa0828e99fcb6 the worst of it was his good nature made him trust all sorts of disreputable people, and he drank with fellows who were not worth the sole of his shoe.
0x3348fed574945d4e7206e870bcd756219274a153 would you believe it, rodion romanovitch, they found a gingerbread cock in his pocket; he was dead drunk, but he did not forget the children!”
0x93f7e6b28eea6b4a0f5e3b930dd92f4d1a8e3c9b “a cock?
0x7b630be5394cbbd191d4cc21b3ae10be7f5e02ba did you say a cock?”
0xd08258cb17633d05c20874aceacc59d72a813af0 shouted the commissariat clerk.
0x1e40b3e55e2a4fd56c34a570bcb4cc649b13d286 katerina ivanovna did not vouchsafe a reply.
0x92e55515ddcf97e05b45ca5f3fa8bb598c281313 she sighed, lost in thought.
0xeb667102836995a5dacac29a207f01a8531e9f61 “no doubt you think, like everyone, that i was too severe with him,” she went on, addressing raskolnikov.
0xd42ac1bb66a95864ec6672e46e8a3bed3eaccc68 “but that’s not so!
0x7b347bf3176d48753836cc0a2281392353c05ab8 he respected me, he respected me very much!
0xeac466fa1e1b4755082c9ccf2db0ad671680ec58 he was a kind-hearted man!
0xf978a1abcc518d299ad8440a306562bf5096d32d and how sorry i was for him sometimes!
0x2d90585da3bff722e4494154af0ebb65d4b92d46 he would sit in a corner and look at me, i used to feel so sorry for him, i used to want to be kind to him and then would think to myself: ‘be kind to him and he will drink again,’ it was only by severity that you could keep him within bounds.”
0x0b3c8ab402f9e1dba9e613fc6aa4f5d46fa89fb0 “yes, he used to get his hair pulled pretty often,” roared the commissariat clerk again, swallowing another glass of vodka.
0xf24ce368763d2fef4559e3fdce7207808ca3bb02 “some fools would be the better for a good drubbing, as well as having their hair pulled.
0x4eb62946b06823d09a4ffdabd1f12f287ca4448e i am not talking of my late husband now!”
0x20a0327757c58891562a2cfc832021280dafef24 katerina ivanovna snapped at him.
0x1412f6587100a9edbbb41183e68ac3603408b46b the flush on her cheeks grew more and more marked, her chest heaved.
0x2f654b69232e0adfd38d03039352750f0f6f87fa in another minute she would have been ready to make a scene.
0x32ea3d9a38b0e338445cf1ae7736d45a597bcb5c many of the visitors were sniggering, evidently delighted.
0x81a0050d1529efcfdcc2acecf8cf97258707c500 they began poking the commissariat clerk and whispering something to him.
0x3a34b06cefa6b0ce3ab39c365e6f9403f3407cd3 they were evidently trying to egg him on.
0x3be5834443d503b3115e10ce3aea2dc1680e528f “allow me to ask what are you alluding to,” began the clerk, “that is to say, whose... about whom... did you say just now... but i don’t care!
0x872d33cb6774e25e2922802a2dbd2f15344e6497 that’s nonsense!
0x1527d2af09b7cd4f99afaad2350665c23bf82b01 widow!
0xd0669850c415da55ca7c8f891feb9291bd0ad4e2 i forgive you.... pass!”
0xab64d07464db314f7127188d126906cfc925781c and he took another drink of vodka.
0xeb37a1abc48e7126b1f2f2b77412ca1eb6b7302d raskolnikov sat in silence, listening with disgust.
0xcdbf2c8d26a78e9d63aec40974cf93f695777dd9 he only ate from politeness, just tasting the food that katerina ivanovna was continually putting on his plate, to avoid hurting her feelings.
0x2dc74a473a83a14160ff43ed60a4a4f7bdd84e70 he watched sonia intently.
0xe311cadaa2e2ae6bb65bff2321c04ae8d5c755ed but sonia became more and more anxious and distressed; she, too, foresaw that the dinner would not end peaceably, and saw with terror katerina ivanovna’s growing irritation.
0xdda2db5878c7e90e29ae3b11383a9315fdc91dc7 she knew that she, sonia, was the chief reason for the ‘genteel’ ladies’ contemptuous treatment of katerina ivanovna’s invitation.
0x3fd5d74873be445a2d3ea9d2e587f20d12dc32e6 she had heard from amalia ivanovna that the mother was positively offended at the invitation and had asked the question: “how could she let her daughter sit down beside _that young person_?”
0xc70d9f14b00491e1fda01446433b22f5836f1702 sonia had a feeling that katerina ivanovna had already heard this and an insult to sonia meant more to katerina ivanovna than an insult to herself, her children, or her father, sonia knew that katerina ivanovna would not be satisfied now, “till she had shown those draggletails that they were both...” to make matters worse someone passed sonia, from the other end of the table, a plate with two hearts pierced with an arrow, cut out of black bread.
0xd63fed0a9a732be5ccd2c870e0f53b49dae914a0 katerina ivanovna flushed crimson and at once said aloud across the table that the man who sent it was “a drunken ass!”
0xaf7b2a1ea8c7a125840376d270b3ab7569ebb32b amalia ivanovna was foreseeing something amiss, and at the same time deeply wounded by katerina ivanovna’s haughtiness, and to restore the good-humour of the company and raise herself in their esteem she began, apropos of nothing, telling a story about an acquaintance of hers “karl from the chemist’s,” who was driving one night in a cab, and that “the cabman wanted him to kill, and karl very much begged him not to kill, and wept and clasped hands, and frightened and from fear pierced his heart.”
0x460daae9a998e1e05ff8fc8ea0e2e6a93608d991 though katerina ivanovna smiled, she observed at once that amalia ivanovna ought not to tell anecdotes in russian; the latter was still more offended, and she retorted that her “_vater aus berlin_ was a very important man, and always went with his hands in pockets.”
0x59baab70667ed85b6d9f3f2d80f370a9cb7a210b katerina ivanovna could not restrain herself and laughed so much that amalia ivanovna lost patience and could scarcely control herself.
0x403fecb816f25fff57cab6e97f4ef32908c34004 “listen to the owl!”
0xfb435edf8497fb488735b265fabc3ba876f861e4 katerina ivanovna whispered at once, her good-humour almost restored, “she meant to say he kept his hands in his pockets, but she said he put his hands in people’s pockets.
0xc0d78e56ad7aaaf39dd22c653605b9353cde55fa (cough-cough.)
0x2b83186be10d586218147ac76f69b3f990dd081e and have you noticed, rodion romanovitch, that all these petersburg foreigners, the germans especially, are all stupider than we!
0x6e0772415a7d13f93df1d888e6b76292fcabe857 can you fancy anyone of us telling how ‘karl from the chemist’s’ ‘pierced his heart from fear’ and that the idiot, instead of punishing the cabman, ‘clasped his hands and wept, and much begged.’
0x599c216cb2277dce5fdb5c2923a22690f0e9f418 ah, the fool!
0x7afa2b5d5545f6acc4ed55b262fd128568fb6900 and you know she fancies it’s very touching and does not suspect how stupid she is!
0x864927017d9076b59bff7077270ca883df1de75e to my thinking that drunken commissariat clerk is a great deal cleverer, anyway one can see that he has addled his brains with drink, but you know, these foreigners are always so well behaved and serious.... look how she sits glaring!
0xa8455e201ee99f2c847a1f61b3968d537301b208 she is angry, ha-ha!
0x9ddd6c2ee3540299bc9e827eebe506f1eff50312 (cough-cough-cough.)” regaining her good-humour, katerina ivanovna began at once telling raskolnikov that when she had obtained her pension, she intended to open a school for the daughters of gentlemen in her native town t----.
0xf323e712414d92e5ee0ed4540b56d8160b378a80 this was the first time she had spoken to him of the project, and she launched out into the most alluring details.
0x49cf5a11ba07245466967d065062733bae9e50d7 it suddenly appeared that katerina ivanovna had in her hands the very certificate of honour of which marmeladov had spoken to raskolnikov in the tavern, when he told him that katerina ivanovna, his wife, had danced the shawl dance before the governor and other great personages on leaving school.
0x026f78bb597147d1e1ecf1e8a99c5e283c72e657 this certificate of honour was obviously intended now to prove katerina ivanovna’s right to open a boarding-school; but she had armed herself with it chiefly with the object of overwhelming “those two stuck-up draggletails” if they came to the dinner, and proving incontestably that katerina ivanovna was of the most noble, “she might even say aristocratic family, a colonel’s daughter and was far superior to certain adventuresses who have been so much to the fore of late.”
0xf32562ff0cc699d2f66dae9af83155295e3af19b the certificate of honour immediately passed into the hands of the drunken guests, and katerina ivanovna did not try to retain it, for it actually contained the statement _en toutes lettres_, that her father was of the rank of a major, and also a companion of an order, so that she really was almost the daughter of a colonel.
0xa73a299778911ce562cc50c87b670a2b8c2d5c68 warming up, katerina ivanovna proceeded to enlarge on the peaceful and happy life they would lead in t----, on the gymnasium teachers whom she would engage to give lessons in her boarding-school, one a most respectable old frenchman, one mangot, who had taught katerina ivanovna herself in old days and was still living in t----, and would no doubt teach in her school on moderate terms.
0x583955f7f58133c47bedd9880a8b6531c6361af7 next she spoke of sonia who would go with her to t---- and help her in all her plans.
0x66217b1c0ca702a8eded7db7179c1764572033db at this someone at the further end of the table gave a sudden guffaw.
0xf22a918a07308885a6823ee8b318e026b8e54bbd though katerina ivanovna tried to appear to be disdainfully unaware of it, she raised her voice and began at once speaking with conviction of sonia’s undoubted ability to assist her, of “her gentleness, patience, devotion, generosity and good education,” tapping sonia on the cheek and kissing her warmly twice.
0xc2c427c1793c96e8642178b70d36a8873440cb71 sonia flushed crimson, and katerina ivanovna suddenly burst into tears, immediately observing that she was “nervous and silly, that she was too much upset, that it was time to finish, and as the dinner was over, it was time to hand round the tea.”
0x57f729fbc70a40261a49aabbe7329769437a4894 at that moment, amalia ivanovna, deeply aggrieved at taking no part in the conversation, and not being listened to, made one last effort, and with secret misgivings ventured on an exceedingly deep and weighty observation, that “in the future boarding-school she would have to pay particular attention to _die wäsche_, and that there certainly must be a good _dame_ to look after the linen, and secondly that the young ladies must not novels at night read.”
0x4e041bb1c0129a9a4941a01b9cd7ecfd4920fc25 katerina ivanovna, who certainly was upset and very tired, as well as heartily sick of the dinner, at once cut short amalia ivanovna, saying “she knew nothing about it and was talking nonsense, that it was the business of the laundry maid, and not of the directress of a high-class boarding-school to look after _die wäsche_, and as for novel-reading, that was simply rudeness, and she begged her to be silent.”
0xf2d0c80e060d1726076de12111be54bfc3757218 amalia ivanovna fired up and getting angry observed that she only “meant her good,” and that “she had meant her very good,” and that “it was long since she had paid her _gold_ for the lodgings.”
0x06718764c829e3538518c340bc5b1fe37aa46b2c katerina ivanovna at once “set her down,” saying that it was a lie to say she wished her good, because only yesterday when her dead husband was lying on the table, she had worried her about the lodgings.
0x952ea16bec6d20e5b30f2bbe2db3bfeb7de9dfa2 to this amalia ivanovna very appropriately observed that she had invited those ladies, but “those ladies had not come, because those ladies _are_ ladies and cannot come to a lady who is not a lady.”
0xeaab2482141dafa9c88f1b86b4e4aad6832d1ae2 katerina ivanovna at once pointed out to her, that as she was a slut she could not judge what made one really a lady.
0x56ce0c65dd7987393383e0a98779a1a8de271673 amalia ivanovna at once declared that her “_vater aus berlin_ was a very, very important man, and both hands in pockets went, and always used to say: ‘poof!
0x4d7072db5477e86c2b4bc7c6ababd00abe92c753 poof!’” and she leapt up from the table to represent her father, sticking her hands in her pockets, puffing her cheeks, and uttering vague sounds resembling “poof!
0x8c19d8e1946fd8315537ee3e92232669791f7b5d poof!”
0x46e9ecb7716190e81b629e21e2b1b5eda9acd394 amid loud laughter from all the lodgers, who purposely encouraged amalia ivanovna, hoping for a fight.
0x53f427dc41906b0af9d755c2b17df1cffcc9cad8 but this was too much for katerina ivanovna, and she at once declared, so that all could hear, that amalia ivanovna probably never had a father, but was simply a drunken petersburg finn, and had certainly once been a cook and probably something worse.
0xdd072daf46d7f50648f5de732f17e39ce989c822 amalia ivanovna turned as red as a lobster and squealed that perhaps katerina ivanovna never had a father, “but she had a _vater aus berlin_ and that he wore a long coat and always said poof-poof-poof!”
0x2f72c368c382b047a3e3fefa631b22e9186f0fb6 katerina ivanovna observed contemptuously that all knew what her family was and that on that very certificate of honour it was stated in print that her father was a colonel, while amalia ivanovna’s father--if she really had one--was probably some finnish milkman, but that probably she never had a father at all, since it was still uncertain whether her name was amalia ivanovna or amalia ludwigovna.
0x32dbf9d22b5172495bee7a25159ba9774dcf139b at this amalia ivanovna, lashed to fury, struck the table with her fist, and shrieked that she was amalia ivanovna, and not ludwigovna, “that her _vater_ was named johann and that he was a burgomeister, and that katerina ivanovna’s _vater_ was quite never a burgomeister.”
0x880aac3d6f861e880582aa8ec6318eaec248e90c katerina ivanovna rose from her chair, and with a stern and apparently calm voice (though she was pale and her chest was heaving) observed that “if she dared for one moment to set her contemptible wretch of a father on a level with her papa, she, katerina ivanovna, would tear her cap off her head and trample it under foot.”
0xce8de8b038db7ff0dd30d81a545dd03aae726a74 amalia ivanovna ran about the room, shouting at the top of her voice, that she was mistress of the house and that katerina ivanovna should leave the lodgings that minute; then she rushed for some reason to collect the silver spoons from the table.
0xbfcf1d2f847179d1676504f1d7398e1f2bc4c242 there was a great outcry and uproar, the children began crying.
0xf051b6e5a926b293b701049a56195dc375131ebb sonia ran to restrain katerina ivanovna, but when amalia ivanovna shouted something about “the yellow ticket,” katerina ivanovna pushed sonia away, and rushed at the landlady to carry out her threat.
0x65d212f7fdc0d377b9b1e9011f0be68a2272a6a0 at that minute the door opened, and pyotr petrovitch luzhin appeared on the threshold.
0x31e31fd7cbe9452c4f606590ac9c3656235b1de2 he stood scanning the party with severe and vigilant eyes.
0xdbb221bc2ed385a5aa96b00ebf15c72d6264c2ab katerina ivanovna rushed to him.
0x723f77db6a4d4c0efbf0b9e73981ca8ac2049ad7 chapter iii “pyotr petrovitch,” she cried, “protect me... you at least!
0x691132ac667df28e16dcf548e2a9dde7a0e80b1a make this foolish woman understand that she can’t behave like this to a lady in misfortune... that there is a law for such things.... i’ll go to the governor-general himself.... she shall answer for it.... remembering my father’s hospitality protect these orphans.”
0x63420b6eb48925479e3f652cfcd2e05799e63200 “allow me, madam.... allow me.”
0x07793cbde98af4936598e024cfbd048fd47f0924 pyotr petrovitch waved her off.
0x6db0c9a094d4511584a9861cb035d96bc0d989fe “your papa as you are well aware i had not the honour of knowing” (someone laughed aloud) “and i do not intend to take part in your everlasting squabbles with amalia ivanovna.... i have come here to speak of my own affairs... and i want to have a word with your stepdaughter, sofya... ivanovna, i think it is?
0x2d0b03007cb26146cde4f4324eff924346db2779 allow me to pass.”
0x47224f4ab7b2c0d432be12f80e7c05b6e2c505f6 pyotr petrovitch, edging by her, went to the opposite corner where sonia was.
0x8e3ce18f4035503cfa4a2759af7090c8c1028cb2 katerina ivanovna remained standing where she was, as though thunderstruck.
0xb67c14bc18c08cc2d0c999884328405cf8e7dabd she could not understand how pyotr petrovitch could deny having enjoyed her father’s hospitality.
0xb8a3584a3b82cb8994d7882039687208c37519cc though she had invented it herself, she believed in it firmly by this time.
0x07fe12d658d70a404bace2d7e868a5f873785ba3 she was struck too by the businesslike, dry and even contemptuous menacing tone of pyotr petrovitch.
0x63ef276d0616132655cb2b2ecc43a525a3ad019f all the clamour gradually died away at his entrance.
0x1c4c8a2b9b61747d460a46e1e8fea306da2f69ee not only was this “serious business man” strikingly incongruous with the rest of the party, but it was evident, too, that he had come upon some matter of consequence, that some exceptional cause must have brought him and that therefore something was going to happen.
0x77473500c9f87646cf3b4cececff3ffd5392e987 raskolnikov, standing beside sonia, moved aside to let him pass; pyotr petrovitch did not seem to notice him.
0xfaf923b0da98dfc4bef6a2c178c3363cc91f6379 a minute later lebeziatnikov, too, appeared in the doorway; he did not come in, but stood still, listening with marked interest, almost wonder, and seemed for a time perplexed.
0x61164e093b1d1ba1ff49f3fc3cd6afb5531294de “excuse me for possibly interrupting you, but it’s a matter of some importance,” pyotr petrovitch observed, addressing the company generally.
0x313540d991798abd81d27ed45cf9c53ea78c4ae8 “i am glad indeed to find other persons present.
0x9e6add9d185800ee34228b723dca6d123cfacb76 amalia ivanovna, i humbly beg you as mistress of the house to pay careful attention to what i have to say to sofya ivanovna.
0x64f68f1dad5af95cab1008e2e7e1f5f5eba69cc7 sofya ivanovna,” he went on, addressing sonia, who was very much surprised and already alarmed, “immediately after your visit i found that a hundred-rouble note was missing from my table, in the room of my friend mr. lebeziatnikov.
0xdacbf6c6a3c5524fd7682ddacb605172dcfa7ffc if in any way whatever you know and will tell us where it is now, i assure you on my word of honour and call all present to witness that the matter shall end there.
0x1dbcaf3961f93aab767d38caae5ec1b6a5094365 in the opposite case i shall be compelled to have recourse to very serious measures and then... you must blame yourself.”
0xabd3708d2b19b016fd94e887c6bd12eb34ac1e46 complete silence reigned in the room.
0xcf565399357a2b3fb812a707bd3da8dcdcec9477 even the crying children were still.
0x4a8367d9b11aecdb9b54d64987b04e871f409a37 sonia stood deadly pale, staring at luzhin and unable to say a word.
0x24d5e75ea0f9279396eff4f273baa734807c43f6 she seemed not to understand.
0x4d769345482e9f847766e6d1024e1550d5e79c50 some seconds passed.
0x73291660e1e0d731020b18d14ed6c802234b07de “well, how is it to be then?”
0x21abbaea593cd10e07bbd9b07b0f22488c39f84d asked luzhin, looking intently at her.
0x165f8edc587318bbd3d9ed6e391fa9cac18ac0f8 “i don’t know.... i know nothing about it,” sonia articulated faintly at last.
0xf7c885b80e51e30be47c2a108098f7e865a08c10 “no, you know nothing?”
0x4242b4df3d26346050e9fabec66ec382cf731bc2 luzhin repeated and again he paused for some seconds.
0xf7c347d9e17ea4fb00ff4a5906912edbe4d4d50a “think a moment, mademoiselle,” he began severely, but still, as it were, admonishing her.
0xc08c19d9fc3eaf07bc275f6faff8e1495a164265 “reflect, i am prepared to give you time for consideration.
0x6ad5523431af757c91ddf089c6d356121e4f49cc kindly observe this: if i were not so entirely convinced i should not, you may be sure, with my experience venture to accuse you so directly.
0x901076ac34472d8630485c712b9b3807c1393e6d seeing that for such direct accusation before witnesses, if false or even mistaken, i should myself in a certain sense be made responsible, i am aware of that.
0x4de006657abe5a8a6de69a7a71a4e260f206752d this morning i changed for my own purposes several five-per-cent securities for the sum of approximately three thousand roubles.
0x586bc2afab014f39de71471e0b89536e72089b81 the account is noted down in my pocket-book.
0x133867a0bb001c079b565ad1670fa4d3f3638576 on my return home i proceeded to count the money--as mr. lebeziatnikov will bear witness--and after counting two thousand three hundred roubles i put the rest in my pocket-book in my coat pocket.
0xc0c8c256af016f4160505581a7f51d6dde05c363 about five hundred roubles remained on the table and among them three notes of a hundred roubles each.
0x13a44f6f6cd62679865c5efebada18ad24182d0b at that moment you entered (at my invitation)--and all the time you were present you were exceedingly embarrassed; so that three times you jumped up in the middle of the conversation and tried to make off.
0xb9127b3fc02490279fa222bbe167756309cd77bf mr. lebeziatnikov can bear witness to this.
0xf937431ccd5488885bd28462da454095d6b92d88 you yourself, mademoiselle, probably will not refuse to confirm my statement that i invited you through mr. lebeziatnikov, solely in order to discuss with you the hopeless and destitute position of your relative, katerina ivanovna (whose dinner i was unable to attend), and the advisability of getting up something of the nature of a subscription, lottery or the like, for her benefit.
0x776b775b10601ca6b744ddbb2ca358059e9d6360 you thanked me and even shed tears.
0xee5d6836f59ecf93443094f8da2771c91fc1a2c0 i describe all this as it took place, primarily to recall it to your mind and secondly to show you that not the slightest detail has escaped my recollection.
0x07b69b2d4e76d632013699eaa1d9eee9cea039e7 then i took a ten-rouble note from the table and handed it to you by way of first instalment on my part for the benefit of your relative.
0xf522bf0a4278bb3d747a1532307efdd6c4c2bbed mr. lebeziatnikov saw all this.
0x15b9eb8611213bb736f6fd2aa3f3781e977bb757 then i accompanied you to the door--you being still in the same state of embarrassment--after which, being left alone with mr. lebeziatnikov i talked to him for ten minutes--then mr. lebeziatnikov went out and i returned to the table with the money lying on it, intending to count it and to put it aside, as i proposed doing before.
0xcb0fd9055d62b62491693830aafc167ec69fb3e9 to my surprise one hundred-rouble note had disappeared.
0xe1321ca2a851b455639a13e820b552a89d1a1c21 kindly consider the position.
0x2be5f1e5fbbc1bb3c39b6d150d86e12699481d7f mr. lebeziatnikov i cannot suspect.
0x1a9e4458ae0eb262ef06e52be6e9aef5022a2df0 i am ashamed to allude to such a supposition.
0x35d506c989bf94f0b21abf9a71069003ded8f47a i cannot have made a mistake in my reckoning, for the minute before your entrance i had finished my accounts and found the total correct.
0xd92f9a305d8948dceda3f89a8737f3890f8d23bc you will admit that recollecting your embarrassment, your eagerness to get away and the fact that you kept your hands for some time on the table, and taking into consideration your social position and the habits associated with it, i was, so to say, with horror and positively against my will, _compelled_ to entertain a suspicion--a cruel, but justifiable suspicion!
0x97b7a01f7738e6845fdd11016fcbc8515c9c51fb i will add further and repeat that in spite of my positive conviction, i realise that i run a certain risk in making this accusation, but as you see, i could not let it pass.
0xafb0819995f80742a58bdcd5be34159efe8ad252 i have taken action and i will tell you why: solely, madam, solely, owing to your black ingratitude!
0x2d5b25d453abe8fb6d060485993327a6ff549083 why!
0xdaa3c57c847f933260182c009e70948299ccd4ca i invite you for the benefit of your destitute relative, i present you with my donation of ten roubles and you, on the spot, repay me for all that with such an action.
0x858438a232ef2b6b654b210e69f2cb394e66ba09 it is too bad!
0xce97b4f6fb830dabdb3c700e7e08281d01522cf2 you need a lesson.
0x6bff404cbad19eda4c659c1a68a6c946ff25ce3e reflect!
0x913958c8c1c402376b6a7e081e271942e7da0d30 moreover, like a true friend i beg you--and you could have no better friend at this moment--think what you are doing, otherwise i shall be immovable!
0x7ca914f8d6e6056629e32a8c4b574bcd659fb975 well, what do you say?”
0x74e69006db5485210637244886cc8beaa4a55d77 “i have taken nothing,” sonia whispered in terror, “you gave me ten roubles, here it is, take it.”
0xeebbf899424223aa92cbf342e28a30a2f5557b98 sonia pulled her handkerchief out of her pocket, untied a corner of it, took out the ten-rouble note and gave it to luzhin.
0x4d51cf7e527e0377141c3b7528604ec3ede703f8 “and the hundred roubles you do not confess to taking?”
0xac0742a3836c3f37aa388ebb13f7d833da68a030 he insisted reproachfully, not taking the note.
0xbfe354fe5a02df3371c05d5d2e95ee1d0f6e4c47 sonia looked about her.
0xb3698cd13de9dc18162f0f7fd0dca13eb7c898c1 all were looking at her with such awful, stern, ironical, hostile eyes.
0x938499871d0f233df1b7aeaf12e02b0b8c1700d3 she looked at raskolnikov... he stood against the wall, with his arms crossed, looking at her with glowing eyes.
0x6acf8b95b0d7967bfa0db2077e2289bde77e5a74 “good god!”
0xb2019a21736f4301122349e4b6d5e2c348617455 broke from sonia.
0x65b425e7cdb2108bb942999d35750c89e1a39bb3 “amalia ivanovna, we shall have to send word to the police and therefore i humbly beg you meanwhile to send for the house porter,” luzhin said softly and even kindly.
0xc7e3b54934ca77787f5b15a51f82b7c5de5fc950 “_gott der barmherzige_!
0xc31fe18fefa484f61403cf335983765d95a2b68e i knew she was the thief,” cried amalia ivanovna, throwing up her hands.
0x97f77b4443fe4911f5b4013c65d636c0c7d4651a “you knew it?”
0x55c32f5810e9c6165e8544fe249b7220843394f5 luzhin caught her up, “then i suppose you had some reason before this for thinking so.
0x7d6593be1f7f45bd66a33e462948a8dc5889eca2 i beg you, worthy amalia ivanovna, to remember your words which have been uttered before witnesses.”
0xccae3f29ef808dfb052f09703ff411019b7edaa1 there was a buzz of loud conversation on all sides.
0xa48dcc859e0eaffc78db4536125a3fa40701ce69 all were in movement.
0x7b3462793dc5580169ce6d754427506abb549c20 “what!”
0x7165bcb70c16530e5ed9a37fcc3e0ed0271da39c cried katerina ivanovna, suddenly realising the position, and she rushed at luzhin.
0xe5223fdb02d9ee9ecf8a04f7116dd98e3afde8a1 “what!
0x5a4f0d3ab6b46bcacc3242c003feb2ef0cb75b82 you accuse her of stealing?
0x1d9217d8fcb68260067730f3510b401bb0a231ef sonia?
0x326a582b6f8ec672b3502a7670c24039af0e7dbc ah, the wretches, the wretches!”
0xd10d064d1414166dd795aaa3a4fa09ffa5d17381 and running to sonia she flung her wasted arms round her and held her as in a vise.
0xd6f3833b1addf11bba11a3b82b20fdb6adc975e4 “sonia!
0x3448119771ae7647f9e1ddb4d8f188420727ea0d how dared you take ten roubles from him?
0xe7a43d5fa5adf2a286d5bac1c240fd9838f9d218 foolish girl!
0x533b062397d12044887a40147a871270ecf9ec1f give it to me!
0xe57e0b78fb9c12948431ce16590112ad57498636 give me the ten roubles at once--here!”
0xca24b586a81105051b0e7aaf902d9a948757d125 and snatching the note from sonia, katerina ivanovna crumpled it up and flung it straight into luzhin’s face.
0xb9c67ea46ecfb9d5e33b18daf5ca05c2bffb4422 it hit him in the eye and fell on the ground.
0xd5c0a778f762b2e2e6f630f0b5ac637966aa75e0 amalia ivanovna hastened to pick it up.
0xb92be305f7a373baea642a5534c2bcf3e76e08cd pyotr petrovitch lost his temper.
0xa42e66fce1d37ae99d832b5aa004a1dc5f25d2ec “hold that mad woman!”
0x42b3d89afdd5b5c6a732c47619554f35ba16bd05 he shouted.
0xeadad5cb7ce54411bce95eccfebe2dd8699b2dac at that moment several other persons, besides lebeziatnikov, appeared in the doorway, among them the two ladies.
0xe5223fdb02d9ee9ecf8a04f7116dd98e3afde8a1 “what!
0xaf62940cb944a537457a624706f78aa054ebee07 mad?

0xdf3f8cf8c983dfd9124faf5bfb115002803fbef6 shrieked katerina ivanovna.
0x7fb1e98420d88fa481a8bac18990db97a80fb80d “you are an idiot yourself, pettifogging lawyer, base man!
0x38b7d95780c99e9edbea646770c5e5b404e1ef5c sonia, sonia take his money!
0xd8fa95cea4403b677b0fda0428cf045a88c0ba82 sonia a thief!
0x2813c2f5b6a8a2f854210694132afd8dc115a071 why, she’d give away her last penny!”
0x62d0b7b1a999d5ae33d0764209f8d0d228948149 and katerina ivanovna broke into hysterical laughter.
0xdbc153e6513d6c450bd328921aadf79bc760bfa8 “did you ever see such an idiot?”
0x16a00910494b7f94a0244643650df0b0d1f5766c she turned from side to side.
0x04a02882489f05e38e9d56a203ec28c1aeeadb84 “and you too?”
0xa6453e25bf58faaf8e2947b964973a88dc014ce9 she suddenly saw the landlady, “and you too, sausage eater, you declare that she is a thief, you trashy prussian hen’s leg in a crinoline!
0x54cc5a044f17b5db86ffdda42bfda3fb6c4645e9 she hasn’t been out of this room: she came straight from you, you wretch, and sat down beside me, everyone saw her.

0x1a119e4a1b5ba3792431b0dc9070caedeb161f45 they would let me in!

0xa77e3c8ce868d485801017e144508e22c63b3b43 and katerina ivanovna in a frenzy shook luzhin and dragged him towards sonia.
0x262115c3875b99c4f62c13ec1527866a48e1191b “i am ready, i’ll be responsible... but calm yourself, madam, calm yourself.
0x8dca7dd5bdf2952e2e5b3615b4a716e8e41bac60 i see that you are not so submissive!... well, well, but as to that...” luzhin muttered, “that ought to be before the police... though indeed there are witnesses enough as it is.... i am ready.... but in any case it’s difficult for a man... on account of her sex.... but with the help of amalia ivanovna... though, of course, it’s not the way to do things.... how is it to be done?”
0x074d38c95199774a16ff9052cde024fa81fd4042 “as you will!
0x2a3df411e35a2f8f891fb1b1c4d7fb2ea072ff86 let anyone who likes search her!”
0x87a0c4f6fd64c3656e0ee9f4efad3c72dd7e21c9 cried katerina ivanovna.
0xb08ada67215e5f5f756356d0fbb530f8d08642b0 “sonia, turn out your pockets!

0xc6c807028c4064445294266d120106eccba84040 and katerina ivanovna turned--or rather snatched--both pockets inside out.
0xce8c98b9811ed125410cddf9118a470413d67a83 but from the right pocket a piece of paper flew out and describing a parabola in the air fell at luzhin’s feet.
0x146187fe3df25b04445399389019a3cd9005d44e everyone saw it, several cried out.
0xfabd74a9604b14b1d844f50f20a1c46b61166113 pyotr petrovitch stooped down, picked up the paper in two fingers, lifted it where all could see it and opened it.
0x75741901bce8828d9590a3395337e33d1729c94e it was a hundred-rouble note folded in eight.
0x9cc1f77b5c0bf2556446849613a89bb22d284ff9 pyotr petrovitch held up the note showing it to everyone.

0xcb0e50048de3aa19d20b585e048557b56d7817cc exclamations arose on all sides.
0xcb45816c59b4751e09a5b57cabc7ed7b06e69b18 raskolnikov was silent, keeping his eyes fixed on sonia, except for an occasional rapid glance at luzhin.
0x238f67b24f41deb8954c3db190930dc71ec1b85f sonia stood still, as though unconscious.
0x84c02aecccfa454e408d5193f5b44eed9b8926d9 she was hardly able to feel surprise.
0xe0e376006bb5117572846d42f8bfff5abff474ec suddenly the colour rushed to her cheeks; she uttered a cry and hid her face in her hands.
0xc743326b9add79117b275916d829763735c322a1 “no, it wasn’t i!
0xb757736189c6cb5764b7ccfada40ace6f6132a80 i didn’t take it!
0xb96317121850581a6b0b50ae001dc4cb5b2d12de i know nothing about it,” she cried with a heartrending wail, and she ran to katerina ivanovna, who clasped her tightly in her arms, as though she would shelter her from all the world.
0xd6f3833b1addf11bba11a3b82b20fdb6adc975e4 “sonia!
0xff29ea2cf36bc9b444646d7ee46f7dae09539550 sonia!

0x7c81c457088993f20b00c56b5ca95dc5fa402051 you see, i don’t believe it!”
0xf230906bee1cd75f5ef110ca17250f7d694cc2e0 she cried in the face of the obvious fact, swaying her to and fro in her arms like a baby, kissing her face continually, then snatching at her hands and kissing them, too, “you took it!
0x61b600d4f845f21f48fb6396c9e06f66b980e113 how stupid these people are!
0xc7498f782cc12d32922282167c1192ce2a3b024c oh dear!
0x7aab98bb8ad4255b9a7b53960304f79b1b64b7f3 you are fools, fools,” she cried, addressing the whole room, “you don’t know, you don’t know what a heart she has, what a girl she is!
0x25643a191961903d8bda6af74a545daed669bd34 she take it, she?
0xe178d8e1a9a4d8e130bae2f12dd788bb5d152b2f she’d sell her last rag, she’d go barefoot to help you if you needed it, that’s what she is!
0xb20d97c047905dfb140ab3fdf03e376254ebc857 she has the yellow passport because my children were starving, she sold herself for us!
0xf22d907f8d862c49170e05e084135d46f3dfa25f ah, husband, husband!
0x7d242349c1742a19f804aeedb235e452c48665eb do you see?
0x7d242349c1742a19f804aeedb235e452c48665eb do you see?
0x2c72779993f36b5f2b9f9baab672aeb549223d74 what a memorial dinner for you!
0x7e7f28210d4afd2bf85bbf55f8d2308f1b559e31 merciful heavens!

0x82b2417ef374259cb8f1e9b7131f301fe1fabbf8 rodion romanovitch, why don’t you stand up for her?
0x72659b32a6d4d2d61a0453d22bca6189ce3a8319 do you believe it, too?
0xf6b3bb3876731d96bf6549997984119c9acf580e you are not worth her little finger, all of you together!

0xd4b693439a34d3dcd6d409c2d06c3a2d37eafe4e defend her now, at least!”
0xcb268f7b4161ce3b092bb28a48befd7746668d19 the wail of the poor, consumptive, helpless woman seemed to produce a great effect on her audience.
0xefc0dfd508051062b567adb575a51b1ec24d771b the agonised, wasted, consumptive face, the parched blood-stained lips, the hoarse voice, the tears unrestrained as a child’s, the trustful, childish and yet despairing prayer for help were so piteous that everyone seemed to feel for her.
0xabcb06ccc677411090e956647027693a6132311a pyotr petrovitch at any rate was at once moved to _compassion_.
0x78bbe8a9a8205b53b64f1b9f52bb6b81334d4e48 “madam, madam, this incident does not reflect upon you!”
0xfcf9ac5e0dd9bb6c649af8df3d0372aab9121a11 he cried impressively, “no one would take upon himself to accuse you of being an instigator or even an accomplice in it, especially as you have proved her guilt by turning out her pockets, showing that you had no previous idea of it.
0x6d9af1159086bc8b2c50447f612bfc34fe1e212a i am most ready, most ready to show compassion, if poverty, so to speak, drove sofya semyonovna to it, but why did you refuse to confess, mademoiselle?
0xa5b4f5b9fc3ce64729f81a726bbfd307c4d3e095 were you afraid of the disgrace?
0x6c66c07320db28f2d5ae491c8807123cb7b87f9b the first step?
0x59edab18fa8d52ded9698b42c03fdd3e7e3ceea7 you lost your head, perhaps?
0x08d59e046499502c29e7a8f027a347f027f5d5e0 one can quite understand it.... but how could you have lowered yourself to such an action?
0xf3daf2234557fc3ca0381837f42ef294f41018e8 gentlemen,” he addressed the whole company, “gentlemen!
0xbbf28288d8293848a4ab06abe79045cca0928d79 compassionate and, so to say, commiserating these people, i am ready to overlook it even now in spite of the personal insult lavished upon me!
0x4ae32e9e0336844b791ebaf94c701b4613841662 and may this disgrace be a lesson to you for the future,” he said, addressing sonia, “and i will carry the matter no further.
0xe405bcc9ea6b26eca655183007064edffdca16ac enough!”
0x744d621947e7b7f69a35e0488a82bc2aacf4fb3d pyotr petrovitch stole a glance at raskolnikov.
0xaabf854e5052dbc1c3a3d889720294cbd3dc1b6a their eyes met, and the fire in raskolnikov’s seemed ready to reduce him to ashes.
0xe8d95bf66f3036b6be7968eb9291d67fad3d5ee9 meanwhile katerina ivanovna apparently heard nothing.
0x7bdd589432eaf6761a75dfc4b23584bb678d6252 she was kissing and hugging sonia like a madwoman.
0xb2e71ee5bf1096465ad7b6272b16f7b957d3a244 the children, too, were embracing sonia on all sides, and polenka--though she did not fully understand what was wrong--was drowned in tears and shaking with sobs, as she hid her pretty little face, swollen with weeping, on sonia’s shoulder.
0x89e90acf1b95cc0577250ff1099f40cd4128a7d1 “how vile!”
0xba09388dd8bf727a2d41fcfb9d6f23eab18a24c4 a loud voice cried suddenly in the doorway.
0x19c7323ec701f47fbf1f3cd0bfd28c388737df3a pyotr petrovitch looked round quickly.
0x0fecbdcfc87e86ee3ea7723721a12dfc02c0fa7f “what vileness!”
0xb079149500b71abd48ce4f98435f24c910420ce5 lebeziatnikov repeated, staring him straight in the face.
0x5028b969b418277bb66db711c88016aaa21f5bd5 pyotr petrovitch gave a positive start--all noticed it and recalled it afterwards.
0x0b3446f22bb11de78db4f3d48cccadca077d364a lebeziatnikov strode into the room.
0xe7a2c7fe7e3f8e4e9bdebcf23c2d382f517fdac4 “and you dared to call me as witness?”
0x3563a80818166ab46a6030c0517b154d2089d77c he said, going up to pyotr petrovitch.
0x9dd1008505177c60e598e9d07c1b2026ab81333c “what do you mean?
0x55fc0bc3693906c9b0dd259f3545a8ecb941c652 what are you talking about?”
0x6f2ee37d9853ab73cbccb47c154c146eab065544 muttered luzhin.
0xa2a393e165bd4d641f8236e17ccfd1fff1e707a4 “i mean that you... are a slanderer, that’s what my words mean!”
0x05789457ab77cadba20807be31b44cba5c3d9266 lebeziatnikov said hotly, looking sternly at him with his short-sighted eyes.
0x031c1fbd5824a461902d2ed29dbf92b7ffcc19cf he was extremely angry.
0xc0da17a579251a0aafb3cf2a117b34518397e5e4 raskolnikov gazed intently at him, as though seizing and weighing each word.
0x9da675babf6a88d906e9687817de6bbe32bf7e01 again there was a silence.
0x7ce333cba89a8e658b2c25893657520953c14b2a pyotr petrovitch indeed seemed almost dumbfounded for the first moment.
0xca5a78abb00540fc129279e7b2878982df2d6f8a “if you mean that for me,...”
0x7c5c52142667d3ba2b426f233ae31f31e9ad23e4 he began, stammering.
0x23cba0655003f9150f91da180584f48849a53547 “but what’s the matter with you?
0xea5eb0931d63824dd9c284d46fc1f4bcd682619c are you out of your mind?”
0xa4b2c2ce00951c26cb26fd514532a9a2748dc8f0 “i’m in my mind, but you are a scoundrel!
0x984fe24aa15941226651bc5b9833f794d48d55d7 ah, how vile!
0x807dac4cbca16ec261e1d73ea347c825bcaa5cd0 i have heard everything.
0x14b34a7f3d2c40b8e1b41f301c682e23cf322188 i kept waiting on purpose to understand it, for i must own even now it is not quite logical.... what you have done it all for i can’t understand.”
0xc386d8cd67fef65574b74df2b35dc645704337f5 “why, what have i done then?
0xded21de332b3f1e410a2c7efab249effeb4e2e9d give over talking in your nonsensical riddles!
0x565b97d36454987fd265f2f9867ca4f3e3ca8274 or maybe you are drunk!”
0x06e71f83d072f2e2d83f623fc9ed083f37f82f6c “you may be a drunkard, perhaps, vile man, but i am not!
0x454f81a7350e887ab76d9274dfca6fc3cf4cbfeb i never touch vodka, for it’s against my convictions.
0x2054d3786c110a3489704a9c90c0803eac2022bf would you believe it, he, he himself, with his own hands gave sofya semyonovna that hundred-rouble note--i saw it, i was a witness, i’ll take my oath!
0xca22a756fbf9e6ebc4dee2b0cdf5fd6a2c007873 he did it, he!”
0x9eddceab41c059e52945ed726ed601d9dd27f7c6 repeated lebeziatnikov, addressing all.
0x24e58f5e36a9af1a631839c48b6416d52048118a “are you crazy, milksop?”
0x3ebf195c89fd82e0ca02bdc8fcc889efa7c0c512 squealed luzhin.
0x3fea8888c2a23d30a1c77748f640bb9a382f5956 “she is herself before you--she herself here declared just now before everyone that i gave her only ten roubles.
0xb395894a27472caf9c76845fd9fb1e94dcf8b8d2 how could i have given it to her?”
0x6d3acaa085f2a298a2d5498879ee25d1b104e928 “i saw it, i saw it,” lebeziatnikov repeated, “and though it is against my principles, i am ready this very minute to take any oath you like before the court, for i saw how you slipped it in her pocket.
0x48167288b7f2a945424c2df3bdb1cca3a83b5d9e only like a fool i thought you did it out of kindness!
0xeb31ed33707e47ff2a679c89f152e2cc3e1aad94 when you were saying good-bye to her at the door, while you held her hand in one hand, with the other, the left, you slipped the note into her pocket.
0x68a1aaf4a6ecdc2e5c1e6a7a6eda6c633528eb1b i saw it, i saw it!”
0xc27259659ea1ae1013e95490340a33b727457eef luzhin turned pale.
0xc292c1cc940c52d679e53ec7c60c11b3b467fca3 “what lies!”
0xca0b03c012326ecc850fe5348ef915645d397445 he cried impudently, “why, how could you, standing by the window, see the note?
0x40ff2d486191e46df890a8e95dafb39f575aa5c3 you fancied it with your short-sighted eyes.
0x69ed7ed668579782207d0a5cf1d76859a6bee6f8 you are raving!”
0x911a5d99308c6339fd2238d5e3df3d3815432447 “no, i didn’t fancy it.
0x3adaf821b783e3a29fcaa8da0173be881e75b346 and though i was standing some way off, i saw it all.
0xf99442d3dacab5acc50b875f838d6f51f87687c1 and though it certainly would be hard to distinguish a note from the window--that’s true--i knew for certain that it was a hundred-rouble note, because, when you were going to give sofya semyonovna ten roubles, you took up from the table a hundred-rouble note (i saw it because i was standing near then, and an idea struck me at once, so that i did not forget you had it in your hand).
0x345c6c2fe4954ed235681b086c8ad15920396ad5 you folded it and kept it in your hand all the time.
0xd520a6ef07cad72c6b7102c873f8a904046277ff i didn’t think of it again until, when you were getting up, you changed it from your right hand to your left and nearly dropped it!
0x9617371b9df1e9fed1118967ffa90bd7476b8d75 i noticed it because the same idea struck me again, that you meant to do her a kindness without my seeing.
0xe69496b235ae8c968aa6dedd007b77ebc25cc68b you can fancy how i watched you and i saw how you succeeded in slipping it into her pocket.
0x284fb6402611c2c1462a8fc5f661fbad109ac8e9 i saw it, i saw it, i’ll take my oath.”
0xba6ca30a2b34c4a768e24cf3fa949e63b8f785e7 lebeziatnikov was almost breathless.
0xf9d2df0e671607f2110026c686670bda2819c102 exclamations arose on all hands chiefly expressive of wonder, but some were menacing in tone.
0x673bb7225c066435a549fcddeac2c67ddd09d042 they all crowded round pyotr petrovitch.
0xc4c3c73ca14e9d30279dbbe8ca9c3d172e5bd24b katerina ivanovna flew to lebeziatnikov.
0x7bf4e559c09bc82c2c147480a133bbb684023f2d “i was mistaken in you!
0xd366ddbb7371e48a6f12ebab37840c597822c101 protect her!
0xa608e7462204a3a7980614ef29d3b9b3f1dbe139 you are the only one to take her part!
0x1940079cf2270877351c63f8a84f003452b7b451 she is an orphan.
0x1cadd3927eff5d0baf52e18b23ec47ce26a32a10 god has sent you!”
0x606d867c8441a06dcf1ae7594c5e3e13a54ab644 katerina ivanovna, hardly knowing what she was doing, sank on her knees before him.
0x9877472429679007d0c80b8cb79023f3a897c736 “a pack of nonsense!”
0x275162a2be04666e324d52366c3eb127e6352fa6 yelled luzhin, roused to fury, “it’s all nonsense you’ve been talking!
0xa97701a1be600ed819f0068b12498baf29477a94 ‘an idea struck you, you didn’t think, you noticed’--what does it amount to?
0x2aed1fa234b42e1810f0a91a4d960a015ac1c0b8 so i gave it to her on the sly on purpose?
0x1a3b2e50aa3a6cfa02a316967771cf3d3aab0e06 what for?
0x6d6ad77f18306e7d9fc990019b1e32764105917c with what object?
0x44ea5d52c450857a499fb3b03b50432770ba6270 what have i to do with this...?” “what for?
0x0623c71b978e2013020f219876a98707a6582295 that’s what i can’t understand, but that what i am telling you is the fact, that’s certain!
0x97f91752a633fc00c5a62906551dcb12c9bb68b0 so far from my being mistaken, you infamous criminal man, i remember how, on account of it, a question occurred to me at once, just when i was thanking you and pressing your hand.
0x77f69abec923d8649a1dc05eb27f28e89bdcec43 what made you put it secretly in her pocket?
0x8371483b9bd448d705fd6211770a5543a8fbc29a why you did it secretly, i mean?
0xe7fa46c5e53846f968e1c8c703ffb877949060f4 could it be simply to conceal it from me, knowing that my convictions are opposed to yours and that i do not approve of private benevolence, which effects no radical cure?
0xcef4a0e3f74eed2a6f35ab3db849c6fe6701971a well, i decided that you really were ashamed of giving such a large sum before me.
0x66c4f0bc1f5b7a1a1d0d2ff6a4426292951bfc73 perhaps, too, i thought, he wants to give her a surprise, when she finds a whole hundred-rouble note in her pocket.
0x2e2bc53eade575ee452d9d79817ac9c56cd15a3d (for i know, some benevolent people are very fond of decking out their charitable actions in that way.)
0xd957048a71ab07c0bbc18782f4be5aa63666de24 then the idea struck me, too, that you wanted to test her, to see whether, when she found it, she would come to thank you.
0x8d273fbd631cc7a8628255cb73ede5956775b524 then, too, that you wanted to avoid thanks and that, as the saying is, your right hand should not know... something of that sort, in fact.
0x72e6310fe0c317bc65421cc919995a942776e25c i thought of so many possibilities that i put off considering it, but still thought it indelicate to show you that i knew your secret.
0x8354df3d1373b86933e56a76b8315574a9c17603 but another idea struck me again that sofya semyonovna might easily lose the money before she noticed it, that was why i decided to come in here to call her out of the room and to tell her that you put a hundred roubles in her pocket.
0xa91f04b6e24ac94f43bef13b21ad165288396b84 but on my way i went first to madame kobilatnikov’s to take them the ‘general treatise on the positive method’ and especially to recommend piderit’s article (and also wagner’s); then i come on here and what a state of things i find!
0xf43af052d773d785b98a18eb47e3eab2f92e0aa2 now could i, could i, have all these ideas and reflections if i had not seen you put the hundred-rouble note in her pocket?”
0x24502fc69a276067485f5051152e13f8231c3fb0 when lebeziatnikov finished his long-winded harangue with the logical deduction at the end, he was quite tired, and the perspiration streamed from his face.
0x0c70b4719d503b1f4d8e62e87f8c0d73e224606a he could not, alas, even express himself correctly in russian, though he knew no other language, so that he was quite exhausted, almost emaciated after this heroic exploit.
0x683b1438cb5598f941af7006a77c1b4a155239cf but his speech produced a powerful effect.
0x05d13b76ecd0a95f4a18e013d3ba76a39bd7ce7b he had spoken with such vehemence, with such conviction that everyone obviously believed him.
0xb816f51b01aed51043bff3453dedee9043dbd1d8 pyotr petrovitch felt that things were going badly with him.
0x0f515bf33b50bcaea92d38abb76bc1e9152dc7f5 “what is it to do with me if silly ideas did occur to you?”
0x72944d3cf0cefc3fb2366f8976a5e2f7c6a02baa he shouted, “that’s no evidence.
0x1aeede45b3209cb871c27e249c70b42c0bc18909 you may have dreamt it, that’s all!
0x5d1a920e810a98a8dece991c4aa715b4d0db5b85 and i tell you, you are lying, sir.
0x13515e5844fc62fab136107e08d7346456a06739 you are lying and slandering from some spite against me, simply from pique, because i did not agree with your free-thinking, godless, social propositions!”
0x5b25f48acdba65b43c9c105a934e8a9850105b23 but this retort did not benefit pyotr petrovitch.
0x1dd6b5ead5751fba691443753a63842a1fb6ea27 murmurs of disapproval were heard on all sides.
0xaccba9a4445cccb3f15e75a766eddd21225e5b85 “ah, that’s your line now, is it!”
0xb03188bb479bc5d5dcc6da7b36af95e8111538c1 cried lebeziatnikov, “that’s nonsense!
0x53714ea1ca469ff55e4b4b9c3f4e6c91379e8b46 call the police and i’ll take my oath!
0xa662baf8761f00a28fe955f145b57343e5c0ea66 there’s only one thing i can’t understand: what made him risk such a contemptible action.
0x824c5dc37d1297cf820ff0c19345ea39a124ea1f oh, pitiful, despicable man!”
0x62c141c0846834e6a9776d86bd31fe5e5632d20c “i can explain why he risked such an action, and if necessary, i, too, will swear to it,” raskolnikov said at last in a firm voice, and he stepped forward.
0x1aba53633daffa145718eb109cccdf562455d282 he appeared to be firm and composed.
0xbdf21d9a15c41c3d0aa58c22491939593544b9dc everyone felt clearly, from the very look of him that he really knew about it and that the mystery would be solved.
0xcf70b39cfecacd8cf0178cf5fcca0b30a72c83b1 “now i can explain it all to myself,” said raskolnikov, addressing lebeziatnikov.
0x65d22b2f939c00f6e554f6c305b12de96158c59d “from the very beginning of the business, i suspected that there was some scoundrelly intrigue at the bottom of it.
0x926795ba3dedaea28ec92d0fee1a2e5d6651530f i began to suspect it from some special circumstances known to me only, which i will explain at once to everyone: they account for everything.
0xd97255393be3775dc81e437882bfa1f75a90ded2 your valuable evidence has finally made everything clear to me.
0x19315bc7fb697c67b1e2df4b417c37078045680d i beg all, all to listen.
0x5e4a399af9e90cf927819048241f5fed37e88fb1 this gentleman (he pointed to luzhin) was recently engaged to be married to a young lady--my sister, avdotya romanovna raskolnikov.
0xf1ea04cdb8acdb05ce839326b7202cc8abe864d2 but coming to petersburg he quarrelled with me, the day before yesterday, at our first meeting and i drove him out of my room--i have two witnesses to prove it.
0x1d6bcb7ea2a6acbf0741a326627d5ee4ab697a77 he is a very spiteful man.... the day before yesterday i did not know that he was staying here, in your room, and that consequently on the very day we quarrelled--the day before yesterday--he saw me give katerina ivanovna some money for the funeral, as a friend of the late mr. marmeladov.
0xdb76abefb79940c9438cc145d4207f51d5dfdf61 he at once wrote a note to my mother and informed her that i had given away all my money, not to katerina ivanovna but to sofya semyonovna, and referred in a most contemptible way to the... character of sofya semyonovna, that is, hinted at the character of my attitude to sofya semyonovna.
0x3426f7f74d27e19463dbc4c77f25009e46f18f34 all this you understand was with the object of dividing me from my mother and sister, by insinuating that i was squandering on unworthy objects the money which they had sent me and which was all they had.
0x6969e5e94c07b42431ab1968661f9867e7c12fa1 yesterday evening, before my mother and sister and in his presence, i declared that i had given the money to katerina ivanovna for the funeral and not to sofya semyonovna and that i had no acquaintance with sofya semyonovna and had never seen her before, indeed.
0x7175ccb127b22024f014f0636b51aa712240f40a at the same time i added that he, pyotr petrovitch luzhin, with all his virtues, was not worth sofya semyonovna’s little finger, though he spoke so ill of her.
0x9ef94706b523a2ccb07da1343bb84816373564fc to his question--would i let sofya semyonovna sit down beside my sister, i answered that i had already done so that day.
0xaf17e9ebbfa7e9adf555a243cf9dfb83aefdf42e irritated that my mother and sister were unwilling to quarrel with me at his insinuations, he gradually began being unpardonably rude to them.
0x5fdb348a2237a5924318976540c3732a5c084774 a final rupture took place and he was turned out of the house.
0x4723c62d5e0253931b663d61751c81c938b0a683 all this happened yesterday evening.
0xdbb6eaea70aa5625c36762ec10bc8c793b83715d now i beg your special attention: consider: if he had now succeeded in proving that sofya semyonovna was a thief, he would have shown to my mother and sister that he was almost right in his suspicions, that he had reason to be angry at my putting my sister on a level with sofya semyonovna, that, in attacking me, he was protecting and preserving the honour of my sister, his betrothed.
0x9ec1e34814a0b468ffa9a82d4a5c0318a2e85e2b in fact he might even, through all this, have been able to estrange me from my family, and no doubt he hoped to be restored to favour with them; to say nothing of revenging himself on me personally, for he has grounds for supposing that the honour and happiness of sofya semyonovna are very precious to me.
0x8be790167af9830ea26f1b4403d902b536d3b983 that was what he was working for!
0x5d15c7504092024947bab4af57d2adc7dfb35986 that’s how i understand it.
0x30b7ce7d3910f2bd36a1efbfb6913064a3176894 that’s the whole reason for it and there can be no other!”
0xdf0d043d92448e683289c058de1eb979683a9615 it was like this, or somewhat like this, that raskolnikov wound up his speech which was followed very attentively, though often interrupted by exclamations from his audience.
0xcb5e915cc059236a2556b57e5907b92e556b2910 but in spite of interruptions he spoke clearly, calmly, exactly, firmly.
0x2e89ce16d4fdf940b54452eb0425589b3092a006 his decisive voice, his tone of conviction and his stern face made a great impression on everyone.
0x8b273f8049af0c2e82b1ff8f2ed58eb89ac2ff2f “yes, yes, that’s it,” lebeziatnikov assented gleefully, “that must be it, for he asked me, as soon as sofya semyonovna came into our room, whether you were here, whether i had seen you among katerina ivanovna’s guests.
0x4e076d34e97b7103d537445d5a619c44952f8c89 he called me aside to the window and asked me in secret.
0x9138fc6a45f596c25654ae07a2748c973bbbefc3 it was essential for him that you should be here!
0x5640dc919d148adbd45574d82a3657871e0fde57 that’s it, that’s it!”
0x0c5fcad1de3de6b230410f6e4abae9cf5b02ffe4 luzhin smiled contemptuously and did not speak.
0x2b81a09f782d45e2a03e7accb16e54c20aca5e14 but he was very pale.
0x9467fdfad11915b965177d0345f0b1674262f401 he seemed to be deliberating on some means of escape.
0x32488ad31ae1201deab828b921a766d8c12ec5d1 perhaps he would have been glad to give up everything and get away, but at the moment this was scarcely possible.
0xe0b4a76bf23651247bbcbdeb914ff863afaae844 it would have implied admitting the truth of the accusations brought against him.
0x903c694612d7844cdf4b201eed617cc22047642d moreover, the company, which had already been excited by drink, was now too much stirred to allow it.
0xcd75967cb198ca23bf3783cce7e7a44744773ed0 the commissariat clerk, though indeed he had not grasped the whole position, was shouting louder than anyone and was making some suggestions very unpleasant to luzhin.
0x4f9b56540ef9b4775143a3c0fd329d26c7652c73 but not all those present were drunk; lodgers came in from all the rooms.
0x2078f61ed9d014d461ffd9b0fa6df87245255808 the three poles were tremendously excited and were continually shouting at him: “the _pan_ is a _lajdak_!”
0x568d3d8cf413de09f524499d60f5cf535f8d4b9b and muttering threats in polish.
0xac72890f337003afee895281af60a8d38ea13994 sonia had been listening with strained attention, though she too seemed unable to grasp it all; she seemed as though she had just returned to consciousness.
0xb4496d6d550bf07c93c8367067a84a51f4804b8c she did not take her eyes off raskolnikov, feeling that all her safety lay in him.
0x9d35ed830ec0cf0f814c1ec7efb80c52a2138a17 katerina ivanovna breathed hard and painfully and seemed fearfully exhausted.
0x26f40b15d2719b7c70cd0222a5f4cf496c1b2eea amalia ivanovna stood looking more stupid than anyone, with her mouth wide open, unable to make out what had happened.
0x0af5d9f7c8eee9129a697bb201a133b08e410c30 she only saw that pyotr petrovitch had somehow come to grief.
0xe798e2690d7e11ba65b1992411e58fe2221339c5 raskolnikov was attempting to speak again, but they did not let him.
0xbeffd99539df3230ab464736e71a0167bb44784d everyone was crowding round luzhin with threats and shouts of abuse.
0xc96beeb947f39595dc07c099c000511d30d7e2f7 but pyotr petrovitch was not intimidated.
0x1a8babeb4065cf60c4db053a80e080b20d51f79b seeing that his accusation of sonia had completely failed, he had recourse to insolence: “allow me, gentlemen, allow me!
0xc4a040d4c17b02fee4b30bf2a10cbbdab4a68920 don’t squeeze, let me pass!”
0xe105c8eb39f51126bb7d9828d0e20d732fad2338 he said, making his way through the crowd.
0x62c9fecbab9c6b3878c7a13fad24639e58bf6dca “and no threats, if you please!
0xa8c0738b283176fc5eb9143a3e70c0ad3c817ea5 i assure you it will be useless, you will gain nothing by it.
0x8dda41c038a380514ce4e3cf70567b72330a13a5 on the contrary, you’ll have to answer, gentlemen, for violently obstructing the course of justice.
0x5e31951fbc7ad0122aceba34019ce28d2a1fb532 the thief has been more than unmasked, and i shall prosecute.
0xb4279201f6b6a1abcbd8804668233f8e33c76c11 our judges are not so blind and... not so drunk, and will not believe the testimony of two notorious infidels, agitators, and atheists, who accuse me from motives of personal revenge which they are foolish enough to admit.... yes, allow me to pass!”
0x1a7c0231618699b1f484fd3dee9052713e2e2d05 “don’t let me find a trace of you in my room!
0xb0b98d4a7ed3410655b202ce9ef3302dcdddabc4 kindly leave at once, and everything is at an end between us!
0x2e3b6b30240328ebbdce289398136cccdd1c9cf3 when i think of the trouble i’ve been taking, the way i’ve been expounding... all this fortnight!”
0x3ee7166f0956d78be97fb720cb417b87a81001a1 “i told you myself to-day that i was going, when you tried to keep me; now i will simply add that you are a fool.
0x76a37a4d0f22c731bce1f1c307397face397aded i advise you to see a doctor for your brains and your short sight.
0x9a358bf49abb188e069ba120950336f16018ab95 let me pass, gentlemen!”
0xb25eb4d24e499c3a0a013287d7059f6999b5cac7 he forced his way through.
0x212199343abc71ea0804db20e197fd9eb80a8cbe but the commissariat clerk was unwilling to let him off so easily: he picked up a glass from the table, brandished it in the air and flung it at pyotr petrovitch; but the glass flew straight at amalia ivanovna.
0xae4490cd28fc42bcf6c288e969c2a4ce7379f68e she screamed, and the clerk, overbalancing, fell heavily under the table.
0xc80b2b39a4f2edf219271cfe1877a4423e776b7f pyotr petrovitch made his way to his room and half an hour later had left the house.
0x08a9696aa523564ce44d4fb3c5ca38f09d1a3759 sonia, timid by nature, had felt before that day that she could be ill-treated more easily than anyone, and that she could be wronged with impunity.
0x9ea55f4181d47805fbe31c34c70734f69ba7a335 yet till that moment she had fancied that she might escape misfortune by care, gentleness and submissiveness before everyone.
0x41c135e633efee50420602d8c4ac091b670c1083 her disappointment was too great.
0x333b67dc74cad36545b35b8333df1eb4bebc6b11 she could, of course, bear with patience and almost without murmur anything, even this.
0x0390049649e7d924bcb4ee613c675945a692f535 but for the first minute she felt it too bitter.
0x2ba0b06d0f3bc8d2cecb8b5c3c61dadf87ca93ff in spite of her triumph and her justification--when her first terror and stupefaction had passed and she could understand it all clearly--the feeling of her helplessness and of the wrong done to her made her heart throb with anguish and she was overcome with hysterical weeping.
0xd572cff4ba38de11c796d4fbde4eb0833ce0570d at last, unable to bear any more, she rushed out of the room and ran home, almost immediately after luzhin’s departure.
0x827a929232515b077ecde45dab45499f0bc70d59 when amidst loud laughter the glass flew at amalia ivanovna, it was more than the landlady could endure.
0x1b9d7dc98c9b1bc201da1ec90f09502e117b16a3 with a shriek she rushed like a fury at katerina ivanovna, considering her to blame for everything.
0x658c4c64d7831149ae7bde332e10e040176d78cc “out of my lodgings!
0xd0e91526ca26c71e2910f937fa103ad4c311acff at once!

0x3e661598052d5c7d22f904d3962ed3969e90b16f and with these words she began snatching up everything she could lay her hands on that belonged to katerina ivanovna, and throwing it on the floor.
0x3f47342d93e5c2c07e1cd89792a643fbaf934d18 katerina ivanovna, pale, almost fainting, and gasping for breath, jumped up from the bed where she had sunk in exhaustion and darted at amalia ivanovna.
0x9ad4bf19df5bbe1a05b67fdeb21d2e913cc4af87 but the battle was too unequal: the landlady waved her away like a feather.
0xe5223fdb02d9ee9ecf8a04f7116dd98e3afde8a1 “what!
0xfed537df52d98cb167e2c95a776d83676198239d as though that godless calumny was not enough--this vile creature attacks me!

0x4f9791d3e4ac1b84923c4f65f63478b5d754d988 where am i to go?”
0x658188ebbbe871a30088b7076ab59048ebe94e50 wailed the poor woman, sobbing and gasping.
0x6acf8b95b0d7967bfa0db2077e2289bde77e5a74 “good god!”
0x01bb2750bd73a72eade882c487290e4e57012a32 she cried with flashing eyes, “is there no justice upon earth?
0x4fe3e68d5ec7bdb1d2d5f10e78bb2596bfb038df whom should you protect if not us orphans?
0x2ae1cb4594a1464dcb01eebd11206e0c383317d2 we shall see!

0x6bc848921c0cf916073f589f4889aa309f00b1e7 wait for me, if you have to wait in the street.
0x3a2ccd70afdc2fc6d4a672521c93158e776cb83b we will see whether there is justice on earth!”
0x54d62399918212051372aca50f087227bcded996 and throwing over her head that green shawl which marmeladov had mentioned to raskolnikov, katerina ivanovna squeezed her way through the disorderly and drunken crowd of lodgers who still filled the room, and, wailing and tearful, she ran into the street--with a vague intention of going at once somewhere to find justice.
0xe1f0e661172a86f771820ede83ab43329bde7046 polenka with the two little ones in her arms crouched, terrified, on the trunk in the corner of the room, where she waited trembling for her mother to come back.
0x6e2e1fc96a0bbb3bc9eb86c9553bca94c4c4cc20 amalia ivanovna raged about the room, shrieking, lamenting and throwing everything she came across on the floor.
0xd16aa71480ebc294338f10528e4211415be239fe the lodgers talked incoherently, some commented to the best of their ability on what had happened, others quarrelled and swore at one another, while others struck up a song.... “now it’s time for me to go,” thought raskolnikov.
0x876e7a1b30b2a1ed9f84f41ad4e3e1ce0afea4fa “well, sofya semyonovna, we shall see what you’ll say now!”
0x4002528be11d9d7b8307e93935c73175d7284bcf and he set off in the direction of sonia’s lodgings.
0xd2b31b9e3be3bdcf49f733c8d73dd7ff2bdb44ad chapter iv raskolnikov had been a vigorous and active champion of sonia against luzhin, although he had such a load of horror and anguish in his own heart.
0xcb81cabc5543f3958fb62cb6e3717e33cebe7942 but having gone through so much in the morning, he found a sort of relief in a change of sensations, apart from the strong personal feeling which impelled him to defend sonia.
0x5cd45d506695c0b3e70124d8f7af58ba4779ac48 he was agitated too, especially at some moments, by the thought of his approaching interview with sonia: he _had_ to tell her who had killed lizaveta.
0x529c8a38de9eb16cad61b322f1ba3691c1ce2e10 he knew the terrible suffering it would be to him and, as it were, brushed away the thought of it.
0x7abef5cdebeaf67245b066bedf323481045a7a38 so when he cried as he left katerina ivanovna’s, “well, sofya semyonovna, we shall see what you’ll say now!”
0x802d836e72c530cddc6f060efdede8afec5bfabc he was still superficially excited, still vigorous and defiant from his triumph over luzhin.
0x186e91303b867a6fae61aec38127c0b7e457e1bc but, strange to say, by the time he reached sonia’s lodging, he felt a sudden impotence and fear.
0xb5d5e9215e6de2f22caf3ef12ceedeff2e9b32cc he stood still in hesitation at the door, asking himself the strange question: “must he tell her who killed lizaveta?”
0x6fc67fe13a62892b60491d31297cce58f44cf3bf it was a strange question because he felt at the very time not only that he could not help telling her, but also that he could not put off the telling.
0xfcfa355d431d8f829ddb138cf705efc3c102ddec he did not yet know why it must be so, he only _felt_ it, and the agonising sense of his impotence before the inevitable almost crushed him.
0x78bbc7c71fd6416cd04977daabe87e16d95e68f4 to cut short his hesitation and suffering, he quickly opened the door and looked at sonia from the doorway.
0xcb4a5d29590dd1baa6a8da535a37c73b7933d325 she was sitting with her elbows on the table and her face in her hands, but seeing raskolnikov she got up at once and came to meet him as though she were expecting him.
0x4946110b5c44b6a251480e04654010e3335750bd “what would have become of me but for you?”
0xf17b85d8d2518d35a589697afc209c9d62c12ad2 she said quickly, meeting him in the middle of the room.
0x981ff768be5e99a8090721061dffd58f6b36336e evidently she was in haste to say this to him.
0xf3697fd6673e7c34be8faaa35e6413a7cdf840e5 it was what she had been waiting for.
0xb895a5698ef6fac5d584a83d6778fe315608297e raskolnikov went to the table and sat down on the chair from which she had only just risen.

0x7550432df7759378f4de6e039e7a2e7aa14a1c66 “well, sonia?”
0xad464fabe6b653762a083d9880823b0009a01283 he said, and felt that his voice was trembling, “it was all due to ‘your social position and the habits associated with it.’
0xe3c593704215694476f3852f7208c5abd48632bd did you understand that just now?”
0xc044e681cdf36fbb87d53cb471c94829d5a15af8 her face showed her distress.
0x47f10edd68e8f472893d6d5a85170c8d3c623147 “only don’t talk to me as you did yesterday,” she interrupted him.
0xe5157d217c1db5b3e2ebb5232477b429fb638931 “please don’t begin it.
0x276401170d38c25019a411c5109e007a6457af87 there is misery enough without that.”
0x68bf3dc75e219334e7d884f5255dd1d88bfee60e she made haste to smile, afraid that he might not like the reproach.
0xf6e0db31c4577c7e6f2f48f282c255a2da6924c9 “i was silly to come away from there.
0x7d8d93b6c99a5aa30b75c188beb690ff804677e3 what is happening there now?
0xa84e7923e6d7948d55cd1e0ccda422bdc1ba4bec i wanted to go back directly, but i kept thinking that... you would come.”
0xfcaf8581195aa15e6c83dd9e92649230866bb6ee he told her that amalia ivanovna was turning them out of their lodging and that katerina ivanovna had run off somewhere “to seek justice.”
0xdddbe29fef7e12088a8fa6f2c39ec51cba65cba7 “my god!”
0xf67e946f735bf11ef6c5baca6cd325a106d9c766 cried sonia, “let’s go at once....” and she snatched up her cape.
0xc912590570dc7bd155641effdc44f2a48db224f5 “it’s everlastingly the same thing!”
0x2614edb894c7dd9a3b7f520c9047f90870858f65 said raskolnikov, irritably.
0x8cf2aaa4877bd70fbc13325a7134775c55319f7a “you’ve no thought except for them!
0x24871290821eb20f342244f6b9189c7888b1f6ba stay a little with me.”
0x3a96f71b1ffead2c62e003396a76c6a380d40b18 “but... katerina ivanovna?”
0xe6d55dd1bb02f67bceef8f9971790955ce67221e “you won’t lose katerina ivanovna, you may be sure, she’ll come to you herself since she has run out,” he added peevishly.
0x1ba2713d72b94712038ca50e4f1d11c8c758d94a “if she doesn’t find you here, you’ll be blamed for it....” sonia sat down in painful suspense.
0x98abb24ca4761a52144dee42bdbfc6d396cc84f4 raskolnikov was silent, gazing at the floor and deliberating.
0x0c2c652a326ba783425ecfb777da22343bec35dc “this time luzhin did not want to prosecute you,” he began, not looking at sonia, “but if he had wanted to, if it had suited his plans, he would have sent you to prison if it had not been for lebeziatnikov and me.
0x8f8509ad33480d398e38f08efbb582bb6986e00f ah?”
0xc82c5eac57ed0eb5f584e3239ffb3410530e673e “yes,” she assented in a faint voice.
0xd98fb3eb097cf69e4557011aff4c10c02b0317b9 “yes,” she repeated, preoccupied and distressed.
0xc949ca0d1c9203c9ae974f7e35415d2d55813a64 “but i might easily not have been there.
0xd075880e13af95547e836f078c8431dcb80307e9 and it was quite an accident lebeziatnikov’s turning up.”
0xe8d349ae0299c0c8c734fc9306dfd6fbf9947085 sonia was silent.
0x421e26c55c60ffe5cf93319e26a42929cc3fbda2 “and if you’d gone to prison, what then?
0x59c771983f400fcbb09f7b067665119bb53b4c02 do you remember what i said yesterday?”
0xaeb01ee3b5eada867d386a6e75c0517cbc0314ab again she did not answer.
0x3c0af19e167af1078343a5f29b30ca15823c719e he waited.
0x45ed388ff23345c437eba3138293130869ff762d “i thought you would cry out again ‘don’t speak of it, leave off.’” raskolnikov gave a laugh, but rather a forced one.
0xbdb63937e2fbb9cdee94bfccdea13e2f2d340bea “what, silence again?”
0x4d48595089f06c92c438175fd275bdb01135a9bd he asked a minute later.
0x944e08aa08045db8ac43917a9370ad614c0234f4 “we must talk about something, you know.
0x73ba60e4db8256610b46498de72c7c30a17d12b5 it would be interesting for me to know how you would decide a certain ‘problem’ as lebeziatnikov would say.”
0xd42a75f592e8393f42cfe46ad486e2d963dc1cdc (he was beginning to lose the thread.)
0x31137fa142a40f43d13e1524913607083e587a77 “no, really, i am serious.
0xb8d7ea606a0862c3950b6ce1c1fd6d9e0f1c2b29 imagine, sonia, that you had known all luzhin’s intentions beforehand.
0x14e32b582bdf1cd79df9f43c1db8e13403629850 known, that is, for a fact, that they would be the ruin of katerina ivanovna and the children and yourself thrown in--since you don’t count yourself for anything--polenka too... for she’ll go the same way.
0x77c771f20d6d206a97121e9f5c55285c11437f98 well, if suddenly it all depended on your decision whether he or they should go on living, that is whether luzhin should go on living and doing wicked things, or katerina ivanovna should die?
0x04df37d28f5dfd05e9ba61e630a3cb13f705da0b how would you decide which of them was to die?
0x1431d624b1acef69133d4809c6d932224c94596a i ask you?”
0x42704afb7aa2a74c34ade4ffb0c3c96bdaf2d759 sonia looked uneasily at him.
0x0950817d45e03573be3a384a32e7cde11fdcdfd4 there was something peculiar in this hesitating question, which seemed approaching something in a roundabout way.
0x492901c0e629968c9139bce5a60452bfe7f656de “i felt that you were going to ask some question like that,” she said, looking inquisitively at him.
0xf6be0df572c3161b376b1e260c828c862c057d9a “i dare say you did.
0xc9a01f4c6683dc18dc7ca1a3a29fa63f2258c8d3 but how is it to be answered?”
0x5265202d2f6949ddc088a78075f3cef136b127d6 “why do you ask about what could not happen?”
0x9b8b4182aa4814a14723bf0e216161b404e97c84 said sonia reluctantly.
0x9c455a4021868fa896d90a2080901798ce7ffef6 “then it would be better for luzhin to go on living and doing wicked things?
0xc1f5b2b5ffb7598caefd179037dc30cc2262d956 you haven’t dared to decide even that!”
0x82f05973b9614e081806804ba7892abcfe24f2d5 “but i can’t know the divine providence.... and why do you ask what can’t be answered?
0xaf08b240fbc072408877792ff407b1147978db3d what’s the use of such foolish questions?
0xe6bd05cd19f167a44d818368ae8b707988495f48 how could it happen that it should depend on my decision--who has made me a judge to decide who is to live and who is not to live?”
0x63bc31f447307991a20c5b1e77427b98ca8e6468 “oh, if the divine providence is to be mixed up in it, there is no doing anything,” raskolnikov grumbled morosely.
0xb74d6d9fa7ee34421cdda34020582f702118e30e “you’d better say straight out what you want!”
0x646679fcedf9466b3d3ed71dfe1cb5bf542422a3 sonia cried in distress.
0x156f4f35ab53b5e9d7358e1aa52a2fb803e1b982 “you are leading up to something again.... can you have come simply to torture me?”
0x5f2b8113d0d9b3767f7ebbb67bbf480c20defd57 she could not control herself and began crying bitterly.
0x9f9890bec614f51bafcaf287534480066bc228b1 he looked at her in gloomy misery.
0x7aa8ee312f37a33dd60be480a5733892ee7bf871 five minutes passed.
0xfcd8a93a23ca037ed9a1d284e580a085e5691083 “of course you’re right, sonia,” he said softly at last.
0xa3687aae2e31befb314a2530b4853557eb905221 he was suddenly changed.
0x134dd4ecf76e8cef3facabc9be1ed9540a53e1ac his tone of assumed arrogance and helpless defiance was gone.
0x97bd45834c5c5eaeca78fb4f8b49eca1f6dfd847 even his voice was suddenly weak.
0x3e7fe96499591cd63b486488420bde1ae41b18f2 “i told you yesterday that i was not coming to ask forgiveness and almost the first thing i’ve said is to ask forgiveness.... i said that about luzhin and providence for my own sake.
0x9712775c47b3547b044ab07183b2c81d16e07e72 i was asking forgiveness, sonia....” he tried to smile, but there was something helpless and incomplete in his pale smile.
0xa0dfffe90f3bf4e1931dac4ffc081e9c579776fe he bowed his head and hid his face in his hands.
0xb90d9c16658bcb6959fc74700e6d7925923fafbb and suddenly a strange, surprising sensation of a sort of bitter hatred for sonia passed through his heart.
0xe19467abecf9e3d3aa552937a193df753e51f1fd as it were wondering and frightened of this sensation, he raised his head and looked intently at her; but he met her uneasy and painfully anxious eyes fixed on him; there was love in them; his hatred vanished like a phantom.
0x780b90f7c3270f9447ea6b3e558eaa82b9c288b2 it was not the real feeling; he had taken the one feeling for the other.
0xb8c5660f0ee0d6da5fe65f3fa3ee0554fb3a90c3 it only meant that _that_ minute had come.
0x21f2c7513ef6a35410d176312a9e9f46cff9dc71 he hid his face in his hands again and bowed his head.
0x30e032f483ca23320d862193dec345bc69f687c7 suddenly he turned pale, got up from his chair, looked at sonia, and without uttering a word sat down mechanically on her bed.
0xd320913776bcd5f66c3dd2e12125432229dbb137 his sensations that moment were terribly like the moment when he had stood over the old woman with the axe in his hand and felt that “he must not lose another minute.”
0x5536203d7566170ce12f9e4f9e5b5e6860280dcf “what’s the matter?”
0x5e52c3e9fe578897d85314e0cbd4720fbab32578 asked sonia, dreadfully frightened.
0x953d1c967005b99155f16937bf5d6b20e7771f8d he could not utter a word.
0xc17e294db16b5ea50ed7f579f872b29c2d329464 this was not at all, not at all the way he had intended to “tell” and he did not understand what was happening to him now.
0x5f67db3327ae03cbbb57f71397cab8cf08b175bd she went up to him, softly, sat down on the bed beside him and waited, not taking her eyes off him.
0x8d6b9ba297ca4c48cc091e95ff626bfc2e9326d5 her heart throbbed and sank.
0x14f9352ca4928fc2e31553c185a0e75efb0dd019 it was unendurable; he turned his deadly pale face to her.
0xac0c554d5445924b62f54d2c9a292fd0b77ca64d his lips worked, helplessly struggling to utter something.
0x081548f8e240d08179c2db69a0b779e7776f7f99 a pang of terror passed through sonia’s heart.
0x5536203d7566170ce12f9e4f9e5b5e6860280dcf “what’s the matter?”
0xb7ad1ab75123fac1c38acbd9c496e5ff582efdc5 she repeated, drawing a little away from him.
0xaa877d64af06fd8b81b091aa0bee1fd78d540e71 “nothing, sonia, don’t be frightened.... it’s nonsense.
0x8c1f837b770d6378f03744fb588a67d40616a3a2 it really is nonsense, if you think of it,” he muttered, like a man in delirium.
0x7285ed4bcb2fcb4f9d3b1948d563b33dd439ba0b “why have i come to torture you?”
0x9d174a2fab6a09bf80c2b3d9315dbfe6b718f008 he added suddenly, looking at her.
0xe7135f6906e36673f29aa24cd4ff1a28a0a03e20 “why, really?
0xd165656bca9baa154fe54638a1e7f0bb648d62a1 i keep asking myself that question, sonia....” he had perhaps been asking himself that question a quarter of an hour before, but now he spoke helplessly, hardly knowing what he said and feeling a continual tremor all over.
0xcda9e65c83a9f071e0891bc3fdd61963e45e28c1 “oh, how you are suffering!”
0xa61796d24d14e865fc82c49943737b9dad810fdc she muttered in distress, looking intently at him.
0x0bd76a304db50a779ea61f9d59a26dd244cea7ab “it’s all nonsense.... listen, sonia.”
0xe76bf0f10521815c45f61206cf701927058b11a6 he suddenly smiled, a pale helpless smile for two seconds.
0xe1ac6410899e30c02e6be5ef89c9a2d5feb40a95 “you remember what i meant to tell you yesterday?”
0xe9fe76a704b86510db0b7f457344289ce3d4b5a0 sonia waited uneasily.
0x4efad73d80561eec2ac98bc4aea77c0b8fe60ef0 “i said as i went away that perhaps i was saying good-bye for ever, but that if i came to-day i would tell you who... who killed lizaveta.”
0x3001198b03676ba78eca9018ade654f8c37bb77e she began trembling all over.
0x06c0460cace862163592f979a6bc90e4260746ca “well, here i’ve come to tell you.”
0xe3fd889f780e90358cde4fcd9dda529d94317e6e “then you really meant it yesterday?”
0x81bb92feb5a33174464de653ed0ade0ed783bf77 she whispered with difficulty.
0x08ab23806f07bb992459d96e9a7d0ea5f0d97be8 “how do you know?”
0xb1164ebee1b43949e7fb12c30ae846e3451c5f21 she asked quickly, as though suddenly regaining her reason.
0x9f228adc4a49be706c59ed6e28daab68b019871c sonia’s face grew paler and paler, and she breathed painfully.
0x76eaa0f872eb535aad60266ff805704628668882 “i know.”
0xf9fb02b1e074baa6f57e1da916ecb7ca82522d0f she paused a minute.
0xa74061f78d4a5259838be71233c93b0351afa6de “have they found him?”
0xee1235127ab368c58ed7b44aa949f1310ae29f1e she asked timidly.
0x13f596b2318a7d846472d7d1c89afeda0d42126a “no.”
0x8ddc7302bc241401961b0c3b1c9133a8c9524675 “then how do you know about _it_?”
0x06cb2a39a58b148157ce16b99aeb98505579d959 she asked again, hardly audibly and again after a minute’s pause.
0x145ab90aa794d18e651dc6c115e219c530369e77 he turned to her and looked very intently at her.
0x66c4df41406f776042a22ad1be2b92cdec2bab48 “guess,” he said, with the same distorted helpless smile.
0xbb4b313ea9e37374830b4c52617010c181c4796c a shudder passed over her.
0xbf0169a7d5b9efc5bf085b7bb972de6c49f17c97 “but you... why do you frighten me like this?”
0x19b58440c9557d7001912b484d67de5748582dc4 she said, smiling like a child.
0xd6281ddb15a7b6cec5e72145d02f0e8d9a13e03a “i must be a great friend of _his_... since i know,” raskolnikov went on, still gazing into her face, as though he could not turn his eyes away.
0x38e04430b626ca1bbc1237dad44aaed84baaf976 “he... did not mean to kill that lizaveta... he... killed her accidentally.... he meant to kill the old woman when she was alone and he went there... and then lizaveta came in... he killed her too.”
0xc42ad1fb32d69e829479a38b316061edd8fcf6be another awful moment passed.
0xe4ab2362c033462f0c45ff185781fb34d7ea8c95 both still gazed at one another.
0x9dd2277d2b2089d668f2029e6684db6b5c996e37 “you can’t guess, then?”
0xd3bd237137a35421e8dbb5cfaa9d72b73f7d6fce he asked suddenly, feeling as though he were flinging himself down from a steeple.
0xe15682051bf24f7a00399a7c384daab02dc56e0b “n-no...” whispered sonia.
0x1369ae3a0fbd7923ec105f01e1d333cfd9bddb87 “take a good look.”
0xa9628790466a33bb484d9cdb1de51046a566877e as soon as he had said this again, the same familiar sensation froze his heart.
0x302cb8b6fad4ede757fcdacbd0453fb7aa13a193 he looked at her and all at once seemed to see in her face the face of lizaveta.
0x7bd230759e58eae236019c307b33d74baeffa650 he remembered clearly the expression in lizaveta’s face, when he approached her with the axe and she stepped back to the wall, putting out her hand, with childish terror in her face, looking as little children do when they begin to be frightened of something, looking intently and uneasily at what frightens them, shrinking back and holding out their little hands on the point of crying.
0x4bc94cc1fa996e760ff790812427ddbc410daf5d almost the same thing happened now to sonia.
0xa24ad3cdc84ba625cdcf94ef544f3cdd4bb3f08c with the same helplessness and the same terror, she looked at him for a while and, suddenly putting out her left hand, pressed her fingers faintly against his breast and slowly began to get up from the bed, moving further from him and keeping her eyes fixed even more immovably on him.
0x6b09ef6eb156cfda9aa7ecdbe5175f53432eda66 her terror infected him.
0xd9eee5201a94541e3193bb3379ae65ed694b209c the same fear showed itself on his face.
0xe75ee83497849c5f9eea8996c3a60d3b3cb6b640 in the same way he stared at her and almost with the same _childish_ smile.
0x420f5e2d84f1947e1632e751f6d6377176b4db7b “have you guessed?”
0x49f556993edc7eb7aa45aab1918393a2d9e686dd he whispered at last.
0x6acf8b95b0d7967bfa0db2077e2289bde77e5a74 “good god!”
0x753ef62ba2be089b109eb148a3241a0988601023 broke in an awful wail from her bosom.
0xa7c39b394bc450254f00ca16733107e9d74ef2a7 she sank helplessly on the bed with her face in the pillows, but a moment later she got up, moved quickly to him, seized both his hands and, gripping them tight in her thin fingers, began looking into his face again with the same intent stare.
0x67622342e3f4140757f43a1405bfe7d76b2d3f3d in this last desperate look she tried to look into him and catch some last hope.
0x1477522fe7d20cc9ccdb089d2b9da920d8a224dc but there was no hope; there was no doubt remaining; it was all true!
0xbb93537d10c1fd37b2e22f17b2ce129add903eb9 later on, indeed, when she recalled that moment, she thought it strange and wondered why she had seen at once that there was no doubt.
0xd03d298f5f7230b78ccce589df5a3f2453e3ddb6 she could not have said, for instance, that she had foreseen something of the sort--and yet now, as soon as he told her, she suddenly fancied that she had really foreseen this very thing.
0x74dac2d02ff90538ded606a7670454f4a769fe44 “stop, sonia, enough!
0x1bc410670454dab924d59afe58aec23ba0a36396 don’t torture me,” he begged her miserably.
0x2220e12d52995f05f409df5370befedfb6bdc9b8 it was not at all, not at all like this he had thought of telling her, but this is how it happened.
0xe9fb39dcffa536ebda3692f4c3fd7e61eba3550d she jumped up, seeming not to know what she was doing, and, wringing her hands, walked into the middle of the room; but quickly went back and sat down again beside him, her shoulder almost touching his.
0x7e60faf93f883c126389e340b3d1d7eadec8348a all of a sudden she started as though she had been stabbed, uttered a cry and fell on her knees before him, she did not know why.
0x3db8bd46375c1d1f2cc6675294999a3838644d64 “what have you done--what have you done to yourself?”
0x049351e1ee5547d06c2f3fde4b3ca76bfd8c0647 she said in despair, and, jumping up, she flung herself on his neck, threw her arms round him, and held him tightly.
0xabe7e394d97354ab9c55825d22ec3b2c7ab2517a raskolnikov drew back and looked at her with a mournful smile.
0x37f182e6efbd89402345b4ff28be7cdc32d9edae “you are a strange girl, sonia--you kiss me and hug me when i tell you about that.... you don’t think what you are doing.”
0x31bac64f053e13117735b4356f11b884af072a8a “there is no one--no one in the whole world now so unhappy as you!”
0x53725f3157836b81c3df5456a3626e70ebe1d416 she cried in a frenzy, not hearing what he said, and she suddenly broke into violent hysterical weeping.
0xc3567c64a0feed76debc1be5c91e67469724461f a feeling long unfamiliar to him flooded his heart and softened it at once.
0x8a0cd0174735d3945f60d38e23a63714e26c552b he did not struggle against it.
0x1d7a1e845787526af5917e7836639ab9aff5e11f two tears started into his eyes and hung on his eyelashes.
0xccce3a4312b3ca8343bfc4e163a11fd53a81f75f “then you won’t leave me, sonia?”
0xdfe87efd93e548e189bad327578dc8f3dd1cc862 he said, looking at her almost with hope.
0x2575372125146b437606b8d8ae1066006d726223 “no, no, never, nowhere!”
0x3cc4141fbc24e7b130e4fd42fb9d0487e7ae36db cried sonia.
0xb791dee7432c5223b4694abcde910d5867aed705 “i will follow you, i will follow you everywhere.
0x478877047b857aafefa56d90a6135c7b84bc38ec oh, my god!
0xa0b6258bbfc1cef8e1d4489d1e8f93007af18d58 oh, how miserable i am!... why, why didn’t i know you before!
0x2334134564ab2b0db7d2ed032462b58ead62c777 why didn’t you come before?
0x6848f7d15d630d3a5a306db57e03d644a580038d oh, dear!”
0xc7d18556842cc4ca4bdc344e163d96faf899512f “here i have come.”
0xf108230ea3c35cd534587a3a237ab457ff297490 “yes, now!
0x36671a3dd56f7b02a52ace4dc5e49d6f06616e16 what’s to be done now?... together, together!”
0x26f55c1bd7f93be7cdc9698de82791b7df503f8a she repeated as it were unconsciously, and she hugged him again.
0x0c050e56363535af1b1afb3b8453886ebd299172 “i’ll follow you to siberia!”
0x3c8d1f22e74df583089fbc64014a6b475d3a166b he recoiled at this, and the same hostile, almost haughty smile came to his lips.
0x980969c542cfad52e33d22c210893261a44903ce “perhaps i don’t want to go to siberia yet, sonia,” he said.
0xa23c36f8163020e2c0d24c4d41d95f7696d78d4c sonia looked at him quickly.
0xad32e218b0a19d00051062d21045b48ff48526f8 again after her first passionate, agonising sympathy for the unhappy man the terrible idea of the murder overwhelmed her.
0xcfca06150c24c4e3556d8467cf9036db00c6b08f in his changed tone she seemed to hear the murderer speaking.
0x0460bdb7bb2d98da9992b8ea514a5b2f4eae372e she looked at him bewildered.
0xc891608a44547d62ab4f7095ae4268a55e0bc4b9 she knew nothing as yet, why, how, with what object it had been.
0x44fa2ea3ec302e0ade5108fc79281e2875724160 now all these questions rushed at once into her mind.
0x9f7e3ec942b843d5155b782f00e24d9f84d3479b and again she could not believe it: “he, he is a murderer!
0x048be104eb9d82bd494567c81a80c25e35f39740 could it be true?”
0x75ce192f4236d4078eb7a624fe30c4741a8272f9 “what’s the meaning of it?
0x4d28c70bc8b12a5dea98baa3da62bf2ca0e2c19e where am i?”
0x288bf88c97ec641f961aa1aecbe70111ef40c420 she said in complete bewilderment, as though still unable to recover herself.
0x5ab52a40add2315d651311c0e1422b5369fd98c7 “how could you, you, a man like you.... how could you bring yourself to it?... what does it mean?”
0xfcac315e1262e65e9276dcfb65452d9e81869623 “oh, well--to plunder.
0x57ffb1d9b5b994619642f41867c58a30eb0c5d17 leave off, sonia,” he answered wearily, almost with vexation.
0xd56f25263b7b296b548fa3a1f6d8acf54bc39f3e sonia stood as though struck dumb, but suddenly she cried: “you were hungry!
0x6cb71361510b7c73d9d643b66def19b7aa9fba98 it was... to help your mother?
0x3b36a54688d2603e98a7478e913da260ab77e6b5 yes?”
0xcfa1a55e43ff5f9bd963716efffc7531807bd09d “no, sonia, no,” he muttered, turning away and hanging his head.
0x5b5e66a94b38903fa517ca5806a043aab3dccd14 “i was not so hungry.... i certainly did want to help my mother, but... that’s not the real thing either.... don’t torture me, sonia.”
0x62fd77cad2e87e1f574f7c0fa0f3fb5970ab1d35 sonia clasped her hands.
0xef120b76e9ae664a0be8f3037d2f7282297ca3e3 “could it, could it all be true?
0x81399c69e2220a6088a67f455804e3b979f2f320 good god, what a truth!
0x2a2647c4ffadc9cb8324d6abae243bcf1f392b68 who could believe it?
0x3d53c90413df96c4183b0229321c39899bac278d and how could you give away your last farthing and yet rob and murder!
0x1156e707d72c866dc955ec9f4eb746ba35f812ab ah,” she cried suddenly, “that money you gave katerina ivanovna... that money.... can that money...” “no, sonia,” he broke in hurriedly, “that money was not it.
0xd3be3616f110a7068deca1a193bb6fd7e7cfdb3e don’t worry yourself!
0x83db94499b10a27224faa2ae0680bb8e335bf7da that money my mother sent me and it came when i was ill, the day i gave it to you.... razumihin saw it... he received it for me.... that money was mine--my own.”
0x09bc4b0e232b585b71060ec872d88c8d09455739 sonia listened to him in bewilderment and did her utmost to comprehend.
0xfd8323f0e0880533e68425c03c97995f7688314d “and _that_ money.... i don’t even know really whether there was any money,” he added softly, as though reflecting.
0x6e408b7c6aee0a3335377839348a4a636510e62e “i took a purse off her neck, made of chamois leather... a purse stuffed full of something... but i didn’t look in it; i suppose i hadn’t time.... and the things--chains and trinkets--i buried under a stone with the purse next morning in a yard off the v---- prospect.
0x96f4dc5ce759aaab01695ec171242f0827192c5c they are all there now....” sonia strained every nerve to listen.
0x0119943b7954f7b82fecea2398b90b76be4bb580 “then why... why, you said you did it to rob, but you took nothing?”
0x99df42f6523783f972ac28e369b2e7aac5fbb64b she asked quickly, catching at a straw.
0x463e34aa225230cefcee8dbda5e98b5bd3afea4f “i don’t know.... i haven’t yet decided whether to take that money or not,” he said, musing again; and, seeming to wake up with a start, he gave a brief ironical smile.
0x9803181ea124ae20d0f525800bb989b3d010a4bb “ach, what silly stuff i am talking, eh?”
0x3f5e1ef9d80663bd2ba27e986cb8d3dd8abffbf8 the thought flashed through sonia’s mind, wasn’t he mad?
0x3da06cb197b0d48c0390083b8c3cc061a44094fb but she dismissed it at once.
0x72b89ed984a413a6ee4e16b66b43287b3b351677 “no, it was something else.”
0xc90b4d22fdb6af703ea6930cd1f58612b6c45501 she could make nothing of it, nothing.
0xd28c42503e1059ad4a8f39e27cc7989596021c20 “do you know, sonia,” he said suddenly with conviction, “let me tell you: if i’d simply killed because i was hungry,” laying stress on every word and looking enigmatically but sincerely at her, “i should be _happy_ now.
0xe1bb45367827b186f02e314ab5a662e218d7d3e2 you must believe that!
0xc41a4f398c3d51843ade47957aba07164bcfe23c what would it matter to you,” he cried a moment later with a sort of despair, “what would it matter to you if i were to confess that i did wrong?
0xcd21e16b37a9ddb6f1e051304198ac54b0407889 what do you gain by such a stupid triumph over me?
0x43277ea392949b093f9ae70fe183ad907a4b7705 ah, sonia, was it for that i’ve come to you to-day?”
0x88b101ef2718911b01cf1fa6858b215cf4386891 again sonia tried to say something, but did not speak.
0xa9c86277b48ef05f10a2ee2d92b8eb4bf96f1130 “i asked you to go with me yesterday because you are all i have left.”
0x7bb47cee2dddde874301a070520a15306d1c1f31 “go where?”
0x366ee1afbf919a427860e44b52510522c84b382b asked sonia timidly.
0xfe3eb044d26ac2d7bd343dd9eb46bafd26c18684 “not to steal and not to murder, don’t be anxious,” he smiled bitterly.
0x4d429d1a072b3301c135c508832d3ab9b9fe7f2f “we are so different.... and you know, sonia, it’s only now, only this moment that i understand _where_ i asked you to go with me yesterday!
0xbd3d7740a6e50c7c240b6e1a08cabc8900bb0644 yesterday when i said it i did not know where.
0x2ac91ba661b08787435147d519e083d4ac9c8683 i asked you for one thing, i came to you for one thing--not to leave me.
0x28528e2a3e8a2361cb523383cae5233cefe114a5 you won’t leave me, sonia?”
0xa4441158bc665865bdf671e4b6d590ef82fb9ff4 she squeezed his hand.
0xf8b029db0a9c820ac3822215a97a94df5ddf1318 “and why, why did i tell her?
0x45409b20f37fabc2dab47a92061699f62eae2abf why did i let her know?”
0x730fb2d6bffad5b6048b1f5267be64f90984bce4 he cried a minute later in despair, looking with infinite anguish at her.
0x050b15c57c3c3f803aa1698eba4c641d864c3bf8 “here you expect an explanation from me, sonia; you are sitting and waiting for it, i see that.
0xd66bc5e8c102415a880511c1c9f3146a6b014390 but what can i tell you?
0xc14bac6e890c62b5b6871008ca0772603aae6498 you won’t understand and will only suffer misery... on my account!
0x59c9fb766eb66a3397de99cae8da34e455e6966d well, you are crying and embracing me again.
0x2cb967047f7f6b10da42086642b63c0697eb1a9f why do you do it?
0xbd97c7f69c6da393183633b3ef5afece512ec190 because i couldn’t bear my burden and have come to throw it on another: you suffer too, and i shall feel better!
0x1c2a89464ef7cee47570003cf30b43224179c3f2 and can you love such a mean wretch?”
0x21b4ade7a1118b4ac163d836820d60dc17abe8ee “but aren’t you suffering, too?”
0x3cc4141fbc24e7b130e4fd42fb9d0487e7ae36db cried sonia.
0x3a34a089f66163c3e9ca84e6e6cb5dfd287ed87d again a wave of the same feeling surged into his heart, and again for an instant softened it.
0xf18517fa0363a5e29b8df97e3912884d89907ec2 “sonia, i have a bad heart, take note of that.
0x46288400662d41e311a48617a0b7cbe8f08fbb31 it may explain a great deal.
0xead7c83d7b3f81df3d22bd9ca7559dc86ddac6b0 i have come because i am bad.
0xacc12d9b59729dedfeb920f23a8e07afbda58e96 there are men who wouldn’t have come.
0x85728bcffc94e0cbafff0b11f3718ab3a3184d8e but i am a coward and... a mean wretch.
0x186c0b17ce2cfe26cd4f89859dbf2ad0af7cd20b but... never mind!
0x95307bb9d9dc7fec7118b36d7de1a0f64854a92a that’s not the point.
0xd23669055615c0cbb7e6b1fafef4993e983be8f2 i must speak now, but i don’t know how to begin.”
0xa746894873057e88c6aec030ef997ac3e2c97c13 he paused and sank into thought.
0xf74f55ac473fda116c88ed0ce5c97a85fb3c5832 “ach, we are so different,” he cried again, “we are not alike.
0x74413e97a9fd8098eeb03e48fa2e0c8645325294 and why, why did i come?
0x5211663d190e8664b7296de6892bddf276867d9f i shall never forgive myself that.”
0x860e1b4be664c8ce3b19aebe5e04def90d5f0985 “no, no, it was a good thing you came,” cried sonia.
0x50838a5ce5ff59e958bec9ccd45b94bd492b8141 “it’s better i should know, far better!”
0xfbfdd2272682d420ebf43f5b0f9a3ecf90d4d712 he looked at her with anguish.
0x9f77405e0d61e86a5b96f6a07ed4a83257e6f506 “what if it were really that?”
0x5fff149643d667b7ed9cefb2c54ff901e1a933be he said, as though reaching a conclusion.
0x8c82b2ebf7abec7a604476322335295fa6fbb821 “yes, that’s what it was!
0xdbf53acc853842e3318b0b426e65e55ca0610924 i wanted to become a napoleon, that is why i killed her.... do you understand now?”
0x259c973b8fd30b481ee2e19f1dd51149bfcb00e1 “n-no,” sonia whispered naïvely and timidly.
0x17bc6d01f45604f7e6cc8c135b64bd2357257dd2 “only speak, speak, i shall understand, i shall understand _in myself_!”
0xec72e448ecc2f4204d336fe8043ad8d571df66ac she kept begging him.
0x16675dee2c8791ed0e22c99dbc633007715b4a02 “you’ll understand?
0x7531432fe3a351e0b35d625d6bcda5c2dc654a01 very well, we shall see!”
0xd7bb1440b224907e60a6be1958e5e494ac6d0d14 he paused and was for some time lost in meditation.
0x029bd7589977e3847c2e8ca61a8c10e101c6b28c “it was like this: i asked myself one day this question--what if napoleon, for instance, had happened to be in my place, and if he had not had toulon nor egypt nor the passage of mont blanc to begin his career with, but instead of all those picturesque and monumental things, there had simply been some ridiculous old hag, a pawnbroker, who had to be murdered too to get money from her trunk (for his career, you understand).
0x1a18a2c0f7d611581f9662dae0f464b29128866e well, would he have brought himself to that if there had been no other means?
0x9250f48d320ba13b7ee11b3801be9d42e06806d9 wouldn’t he have felt a pang at its being so far from monumental and... and sinful, too?
0x1020754157e84e4b0002c6003d780eda31026477 well, i must tell you that i worried myself fearfully over that ‘question’ so that i was awfully ashamed when i guessed at last (all of a sudden, somehow) that it would not have given him the least pang, that it would not even have struck him that it was not monumental... that he would not have seen that there was anything in it to pause over, and that, if he had had no other way, he would have strangled her in a minute without thinking about it!
0xbcc22f4e5c14db313c0a71d91d6ad0469693b286 well, i too... left off thinking about it... murdered her, following his example.
0x89a4b5b2242451539a223bea0c3ced5c13dbb665 and that’s exactly how it was!
0xfde66a3323a1f1c0bf198cf3978ec4115bb83014 do you think it funny?
0x028eb6ce24a33d0c07c5fbf2d9cb86454574b9a6 yes, sonia, the funniest thing of all is that perhaps that’s just how it was.”
0x90f8ec9c0540318b1854b61473bd4fca2552ec1c sonia did not think it at all funny.
0x67d99c775aa0c6f8c2cb8520f42b1461550528d3 “you had better tell me straight out... without examples,” she begged, still more timidly and scarcely audibly.
0xcacdb6b32f8f700298a9f2f66c2cf7e0814d90c0 he turned to her, looked sadly at her and took her hands.
0xfb5d2c2cd5c483a04829945f5232dd40b6221eda “you are right again, sonia.
0x7ce7f7318172dc216906e2b93331c4132b6c58c3 of course that’s all nonsense, it’s almost all talk!
0x89963638f4d3ab3be9e07e6226e7334697940e19 you see, you know of course that my mother has scarcely anything, my sister happened to have a good education and was condemned to drudge as a governess.
0x00afc3b2e9af45beb6295b48bd8573d1c6e76983 all their hopes were centered on me.
0x518dc1a4c60c812056c7d4b4aa3ccc5a7628901f i was a student, but i couldn’t keep myself at the university and was forced for a time to leave it.
0x7902e39f2f8f18c2f41066cdcfa31c81f741736d even if i had lingered on like that, in ten or twelve years i might (with luck) hope to be some sort of teacher or clerk with a salary of a thousand roubles” (he repeated it as though it were a lesson) “and by that time my mother would be worn out with grief and anxiety and i could not succeed in keeping her in comfort while my sister... well, my sister might well have fared worse!
0x1860a0901ef65ef763f103329250e3a3a342a2b4 and it’s a hard thing to pass everything by all one’s life, to turn one’s back upon everything, to forget one’s mother and decorously accept the insults inflicted on one’s sister.
0xa0d8974bf906e997655af6cfa29ef0e9b6cbea21 why should one?
0x91d032c68205bb78cda3cf9ce313f03582c2d113 when one has buried them to burden oneself with others--wife and children--and to leave them again without a farthing?
0xbb6730605107b0c1b9560671719b7d31768dda8c so i resolved to gain possession of the old woman’s money and to use it for my first years without worrying my mother, to keep myself at the university and for a little while after leaving it--and to do this all on a broad, thorough scale, so as to build up a completely new career and enter upon a new life of independence.... well... that’s all.... well, of course in killing the old woman i did wrong.... well, that’s enough.”
0x51d18865771c2ba1efa9b52384176ec1d3d5e837 he struggled to the end of his speech in exhaustion and let his head sink.
0x759167a17ed249c7a6e0f0cf83264dd2c65aa5eb “oh, that’s not it, that’s not it,” sonia cried in distress.
0xb44b73bffdc1341ef0fc64a2328f5cd1110b7b31 “how could one... no, that’s not right, not right.”
0x5c1179ca53c4e7e878a4e754c77b46ce5ab8ad9a “you see yourself that it’s not right.
0x9b2c65639c0a03f5ee94eebc6ce90eadd41b3e19 but i’ve spoken truly, it’s the truth.”
0x4758ca43da7db4b485328d1bc32543bf122b5672 “as though that could be the truth!
0x5f81ebe0779b2e658335e2fa9a83597f3d963022 good god!”
0x0c14a96034311c5ce516c31c62a5d80ad992c18a “i’ve only killed a louse, sonia, a useless, loathsome, harmful creature.”
0xf12828fe369002625c27e377601023444fa66c89 “a human being--a louse!”
0x8310f2edf1a8d0d8ab6e83df57e6edf2a4ef8231 “i too know it wasn’t a louse,” he answered, looking strangely at her.
0x249180caf61f8ee0278444af3a8b18f8f45df71e “but i am talking nonsense, sonia,” he added.
0x799c39529adf0c14da8c8ca287aa62167e3ba37b “i’ve been talking nonsense a long time.... that’s not it, you are right there.
0xe77afde2ea919ae0591ea965d2aaf4e49c4dea65 there were quite, quite other causes for it!
0x53f8f57214627797637aff3d2651169710e081f0 i haven’t talked to anyone for so long, sonia.... my head aches dreadfully now.”
0xcec9ade69d5080dac77a0fc4101aad0b4de33864 his eyes shone with feverish brilliance.
0xadc0ba96dad4871e3a4e4e2a43993a9e2afecca5 he was almost delirious; an uneasy smile strayed on his lips.
0xaa31df98ac036eb9db2eaa082dc33443c7e8c6fe his terrible exhaustion could be seen through his excitement.
0x0a9c86d891510a7a17a91b66ae189f6bc6724f6c sonia saw how he was suffering.
0xc7eaa416fea8a28c9c51ea4d165dcf8070d2927d she too was growing dizzy.
0x8693bb78c48db768f2ea56ba9a4ac652001fb607 and he talked so strangely; it seemed somehow comprehensible, but yet... “but how, how!
0x5f81ebe0779b2e658335e2fa9a83597f3d963022 good god!”
0x90a6a9226a010ed1548fdc9baf3973d349cf18c6 and she wrung her hands in despair.
0xe2e2cdf248f79b17bea24cfdee1551d0f20d3759 “no, sonia, that’s not it,” he began again suddenly, raising his head, as though a new and sudden train of thought had struck and as it were roused him--“that’s not it!
0xd1469e1f5d3bf9dde261d1935066bc3704ada99f better... imagine--yes, it’s certainly better--imagine that i am vain, envious, malicious, base, vindictive and... well, perhaps with a tendency to insanity.
0x2be8500fd1b7c7a2d1a0ccb651becf64ccfde8f6 (let’s have it all out at once!
0xac5ffb19c0e2d8714a6dfebe34243ffd0dcb910c they’ve talked of madness already, i noticed.)
0xdebc871f587fe28f81fb7c43628dbf84a1b04215 i told you just now i could not keep myself at the university.
0x610382011226cb2ba5dbdd4fab301dc5a542cd5a but do you know that perhaps i might have done?
0x6e20d7dc26f1b8a89a1fbe4dd4a1b1b460319139 my mother would have sent me what i needed for the fees and i could have earned enough for clothes, boots and food, no doubt.
0xef6e87ba8b1db600f3b9a5f5aa6f8af6c8fe4051 lessons had turned up at half a rouble.
0xf0c8e64ff46b95410c6d65cfa0ebc2a1a3ca02ea razumihin works!
0xadfbba05431913068149dcccc85a862ef205452f but i turned sulky and wouldn’t.
0x8402020bcc31b3c97bd647e84ba1d73ab9af6018 (yes, sulkiness, that’s the right word for it!)
0x504e7b24da775f9a19e047ce48853c9050259ef8 i sat in my room like a spider.
0x0e863bd619b241db99fd2e9779d7b3eb2da7fed0 you’ve been in my den, you’ve seen it.... and do you know, sonia, that low ceilings and tiny rooms cramp the soul and the mind?
0x8c165fb4477ca3bf21ef24ee603d92100fb062b7 ah, how i hated that garret!
0x3a78f6f37cfc3439190d2c6deae8d39157b2130f and yet i wouldn’t go out of it!
0xd0e882c0dd8d5a4421cd2b650381133520848c2f i wouldn’t on purpose!
0xe6b4c3a9e4c9c05965b384e8fcb2d237fc5a6e12 i didn’t go out for days together, and i wouldn’t work, i wouldn’t even eat, i just lay there doing nothing.
0x85e3b80a6d97cc6298c15517aad61dd754ae409b if nastasya brought me anything, i ate it, if she didn’t, i went all day without; i wouldn’t ask, on purpose, from sulkiness!
0x32a3eccc001eae8bcd00e963ae550f83e6aa1821 at night i had no light, i lay in the dark and i wouldn’t earn money for candles.
0xb2b4fdb58e991374fef0514699455b8549b21b1c i ought to have studied, but i sold my books; and the dust lies an inch thick on the notebooks on my table.
0x3fb68283f36f89b37789fb6ed680e40e89985325 i preferred lying still and thinking.
0x60c5a76974aac5c8e3761404ab19e8be37c73bc2 and i kept thinking.... and i had dreams all the time, strange dreams of all sorts, no need to describe!
0x55537e53657cce135de1e0523162824877570e5b only then i began to fancy that... no, that’s not it!
0xb85bbef213bf64082c7d4cdc1317eb2dfd5d162e again i am telling you wrong!
0x019a29412de3271e3bcc2c0b363d44d2c3b3792d you see i kept asking myself then: why am i so stupid that if others are stupid--and i know they are--yet i won’t be wiser?
0xd6677a4f0b7bbd5d253a66a34d27bdd54e6132c4 then i saw, sonia, that if one waits for everyone to get wiser it will take too long.... afterwards i understood that that would never come to pass, that men won’t change and that nobody can alter it and that it’s not worth wasting effort over it.
0xd6d31b5b576f16eb2fdce246e0f67c5ac9e31b2f yes, that’s so.
0x9e44818f5d1afdd2a60f549389a8304fe9516885 that’s the law of their nature, sonia,... that’s so!... and i know now, sonia, that whoever is strong in mind and spirit will have power over them.
0xf030e7dae88d5f56c93fe31aad2580bfea30bb36 anyone who is greatly daring is right in their eyes.
0x16a9d91be563bbfd2b62ce056a2e08dbda8b6038 he who despises most things will be a lawgiver among them and he who dares most of all will be most in the right!
0x1083211a3a21f383a2fd12e44a45d52eeb11b84d so it has been till now and so it will always be.
0xce1e4ef69a55e8acb1d31b3a540b0e611c7bc62c a man must be blind not to see it!”
0x2a12fdb1dd9dc54518a57cfcf6b3abb706b9b0a1 though raskolnikov looked at sonia as he said this, he no longer cared whether she understood or not.
0x3292fe525d697bba12c2773b2c056abebf187fbb the fever had complete hold of him; he was in a sort of gloomy ecstasy (he certainly had been too long without talking to anyone).
0xd76989cff7a67be5df57d6dda92039c9788443da sonia felt that his gloomy creed had become his faith and code.
0x29ac4b08c359f3499177e0e730794b6eac2b1ecb “i divined then, sonia,” he went on eagerly, “that power is only vouchsafed to the man who dares to stoop and pick it up.
0x07e2128c89fc62af52f4941d6097a590f48998f8 there is only one thing, one thing needful: one has only to dare!
0x11178dfcd0d9a0fe1d499fd799beaad74b70133b then for the first time in my life an idea took shape in my mind which no one had ever thought of before me, no one!
0x65bb225caca21d690bee7cf9ce3b970d8950c426 i saw clear as daylight how strange it is that not a single person living in this mad world has had the daring to go straight for it all and send it flying to the devil!
0xc7907fe6224d5352d2a9633d67003d7fd5efde4a i... i wanted _to have the daring_... and i killed her.
0xf48b8ee5117321ab09a04babc5a91d2e07c15b5e i only wanted to have the daring, sonia!
0xa1d56d8da6351c4d8bfcd9c1af546605d7b7fe2a that was the whole cause of it!”
0x17868464940374e5b5a41354a583b3d346de2eb2 “oh hush, hush,” cried sonia, clasping her hands.
0xb9847a01d5ca9a3db6407c8fa4e4a2834171e0fa “you turned away from god and god has smitten you, has given you over to the devil!”
0xefe5f87b6b4534c2f5abe522b4616a4c5a8fcd9d “then sonia, when i used to lie there in the dark and all this became clear to me, was it a temptation of the devil, eh?”
0xfa55df81d29d34d8147e5a2bf3a6c95b1b8a3bc8 “hush, don’t laugh, blasphemer!
0x73d4b89f669842c51dffb37700b39d91d78a2f86 you don’t understand, you don’t understand!
0x15fb68cf06e6d35e12ccb1d4a06fc0bedc72b8f4 oh god!
0xc758150110a313550eef22389d6151b8c742e88a he won’t understand!”
0x9362bd654e985f71cdd1b805c3e644cf0a06f2ec “hush, sonia!
0x8d23171650fd0d4d5cda952b2fea0f9340083461 i am not laughing.
0x39ee3bde1e0b935d9e158585e60c6351252078ca i know myself that it was the devil leading me.
0xc2c1d0d9eec7f4c8eacae6e8c347cc92c850ae1c hush, sonia, hush!”
0xa862c3baba46b3207398460b519dfe752e7512c5 he repeated with gloomy insistence.
0x77bc63aca1f943a070721b412ea2040e93a3b2ee “i know it all, i have thought it all over and over and whispered it all over to myself, lying there in the dark.... i’ve argued it all over with myself, every point of it, and i know it all, all!
0x56377e27ec1445a19219555c0239590e4a7918cc and how sick, how sick i was then of going over it all!
0xf5940cc4fe620265a63846b9d28ddd4d66117dc8 i have kept wanting to forget it and make a new beginning, sonia, and leave off thinking.
0x348253ebdc8f1bec62e317d7a88ab8d95e030994 and you don’t suppose that i went into it headlong like a fool?
0x4c039a0856d7047b8cd7daa64174b5f42e371eea i went into it like a wise man, and that was just my destruction.
0x52d395fb461890f407913ffd7a7b5ce50a61261f and you mustn’t suppose that i didn’t know, for instance, that if i began to question myself whether i had the right to gain power--i certainly hadn’t the right--or that if i asked myself whether a human being is a louse it proved that it wasn’t so for me, though it might be for a man who would go straight to his goal without asking questions.... if i worried myself all those days, wondering whether napoleon would have done it or not, i felt clearly of course that i wasn’t napoleon.
0x805bdaea3c6cfafe3e1d643a5ce1e09c1c3eef9e i had to endure all the agony of that battle of ideas, sonia, and i longed to throw it off: i wanted to murder without casuistry, to murder for my own sake, for myself alone!
0x837671d33d164dc197bae1a1d6b1fd05e2ea46bc i didn’t want to lie about it even to myself.
0xc4db7c5dd38b7bd20ab5977566cbd602b7f96980 it wasn’t to help my mother i did the murder--that’s nonsense--i didn’t do the murder to gain wealth and power and to become a benefactor of mankind.
0x182f3172e74ffdcd2ef7905f66169ffe284010df nonsense!
0xb48845bc896d6877faf97302265c180a0bf77915 i simply did it; i did the murder for myself, for myself alone, and whether i became a benefactor to others, or spent my life like a spider catching men in my web and sucking the life out of men, i couldn’t have cared at that moment.... and it was not the money i wanted, sonia, when i did it.
0x06a70bb8bebfafcdb42ba35ae412a84bf7c5ca80 it was not so much the money i wanted, but something else.... i know it all now.... understand me!
0x31094073dc8752de9479a4dc06d097e565ee18db perhaps i should never have committed a murder again.
0xe407c398a8f8fa2113f7107cd3ca86d93bea657a i wanted to find out something else; it was something else led me on.
0x9ddf92e9b84bbe80300edd225b68faa7e29201bf i wanted to find out then and quickly whether i was a louse like everybody else or a man.
0x87ba5bcd9a9c52822ddfa861c226295b9f8be113 whether i can step over barriers or not, whether i dare stoop to pick up or not, whether i am a trembling creature or whether i have the _right_...” “to kill?
0xb4eccfc3a4bb3ff539ad7a724f89bdd7dc3ffb28 have the right to kill?”
0x62fd77cad2e87e1f574f7c0fa0f3fb5970ab1d35 sonia clasped her hands.
0x631ff2ce2fd92a74ea907fbde5cfd421555d8f0c “ach, sonia!”
0x0ff1942a5bbfed211ba76b7bb06ec6f195654901 he cried irritably and seemed about to make some retort, but was contemptuously silent.
0xaa284319113a1e431d8539d40ce0a844a27b3075 “don’t interrupt me, sonia.
0xf84d950c59eeae9b9e5d570e9b0efa5857f4293f i want to prove one thing only, that the devil led me on then and he has shown me since that i had not the right to take that path, because i am just such a louse as all the rest.
0x6872466fa4eacde54e81dff0153c8d89257f6120 he was mocking me and here i’ve come to you now!
0x4077c7aa9758f52505c33e94be3b6c70c9f7dfb2 welcome your guest!
0xb045a1b9715ba03f64880d9f033b98f422d08140 if i were not a louse, should i have come to you?
0x50402f42f78a7f4b8e37aa8994dfed25353eee4c listen: when i went then to the old woman’s i only went to _try_.... you may be sure of that!”
0x4d43bf12b06a8f49c931b7a1abca90e929395b28 “and you murdered her!”
0xdbb70dc093c040c97ff0165e62e443676a804a8c “but how did i murder her?
0x8c50a7ff8377352ff87eaa88a231d7ede48066d8 is that how men do murders?
0xecb21f7ce6dac0670c470e58b768ccfefbcd7d9d do men go to commit a murder as i went then?
0xf4980f3bbcf707bf050a23b17df5378a6ee80f1a i will tell you some day how i went!
0xaf5ee5c799e4c36b0819bb3532c3cb9fb2f8b676 did i murder the old woman?
0x521590292fc6f844ab5fc2ab3906ff5a1b314c6a i murdered myself, not her!
0x44d4eb5cd8c3a721091adceb542a8ce23fb763fa i crushed myself once for all, for ever.... but it was the devil that killed that old woman, not i. enough, enough, sonia, enough!
0x845192891b787865c68e21c6db03c98742db86d8 let me be!”
0x29b04693b20ba17c0943bbc48cadac9f0c2df6a2 he cried in a sudden spasm of agony, “let me be!”
0x0371927cd48cb67c63a645fddeaf3eeeefd53aa0 he leaned his elbows on his knees and squeezed his head in his hands as in a vise.
0xa7eb4b9c600383c4da2f06211fc8aae1feb74eae “what suffering!”
0x1d2b29b265611ce6bc3ebb1f848af8a893ab1133 a wail of anguish broke from sonia.
0x49639c37cfb92df5675391fe521a867dfd49c8b8 “well, what am i to do now?”
0x6368c841c2dc943bdc651eac5e976c346ddf76d4 he asked, suddenly raising his head and looking at her with a face hideously distorted by despair.
0x6c35dfe6a0d7c9b839040fc44ed0ffc9ea3ef785 “what are you to do?”
0xe9f8a713b9ed00465865778d3de212715112f41e she cried, jumping up, and her eyes that had been full of tears suddenly began to shine.
0xa6f30060fcefa24aeccdbb1b246e059984827cd3 “stand up!”
0xafc832f55a2bdcf991563896ae4c95db158b2c87 (she seized him by the shoulder, he got up, looking at her almost bewildered.)
0x6d6363769ec4a347c947346739156c0bb73f98f9 “go at once, this very minute, stand at the cross-roads, bow down, first kiss the earth which you have defiled and then bow down to all the world and say to all men aloud, ‘i am a murderer!’
0x9df165e48a93dea0910bd187fcabd8a39944d3f9 then god will send you life again.
0xbf75e9e2ede7cce263d1977d88183db9df32e4ec will you go, will you go?”
0x81e7469df6cb86f1e307fbda1f0f20de42ce6775 she asked him, trembling all over, snatching his two hands, squeezing them tight in hers and gazing at him with eyes full of fire.
0x8669ed6abb66f600a0cd4edd4a5cb14b64978cd8 he was amazed at her sudden ecstasy.
0x84ba3081f8d14c967df02e4bc57b79bfa1608ac9 “you mean siberia, sonia?
0x2268f19467f54489822fc3f8a25e1ba644ff6653 i must give myself up?”
0x0d66007bd6552c02ef2f83daa83249c3dd9f70a0 he asked gloomily.
0x45382d3a6062b0ea54d229c7676d86e3209b0f66 “suffer and expiate your sin by it, that’s what you must do.”

0x5b433146d25fa9d39780b194448822d162cf048f he added with a bitter smile.
0x3a4a56334948ae8e16176022f91f8d0ec1911595 “why, they would laugh at me, and would call me a fool for not getting it.

0x272e6560ea9cd1f618a836b7c18615d919a79be6 she repeated, holding out her hands in despairing supplication.
0x9723abbc3088ab0679d92ee6f2244a3cd0dbfb8a “perhaps i’ve been unfair to myself,” he observed gloomily, pondering, “perhaps after all i am a man and not a louse and i’ve been in too great a hurry to condemn myself.

0x1e1df05b152fe7501fb6084062f09a47ab3d2003 but they will certainly arrest me.
0x5e574f192a437646e91d1ff25839df20f0f6491f if it had not been for something that happened, they would have done so to-day for certain; perhaps even now they will arrest me to-day.... but that’s no matter, sonia; they’ll let me out again... for there isn’t any real proof against me, and there won’t be, i give you my word for it.
0xbd5e46e6116cffba2a21ca3037de4df3609f7aa4 and they can’t convict a man on what they have against me.

0x511dee5e8c09f417f50ce1f530ac7110a0d5b0d1 will you come and see me in prison when i am there?”
0x87f2f240eac3fe045402f7b3aa01c2199e57165c “oh, i will, i will.”
0x4be0903139ebea4d817e63eca7c00faa7ccc9a2a they sat side by side, both mournful and dejected, as though they had been cast up by the tempest alone on some deserted shore.
0xdc1c4768139777b0a97efb4d3f32ea6a6ce669c6 he looked at sonia and felt how great was her love for him, and strange to say he felt it suddenly burdensome and painful to be so loved.
0x85f654b98c7c30eef27ffe3e56541f9a8853f2c7 yes, it was a strange and awful sensation!
0xf56b069fbd6213966d56ae4647f00fe2b927ca07 on his way to see sonia he had felt that all his hopes rested on her; he expected to be rid of at least part of his suffering, and now, when all her heart turned towards him, he suddenly felt that he was immeasurably unhappier than before.
0x4b0c578dc3a0f0965a187e78aaf2bd2848bd63f6 “sonia,” he said, “you’d better not come and see me when i am in prison.”
0xccd99b66471ff19bd44ceec79b59997a03bc9a20 sonia did not answer, she was crying.
0x8d24194bd0d829fbd504519b89effa46295affee several minutes passed.
0x21feb426afe89ebf9437db827db9827f3b876835 “have you a cross on you?”
0x024ec6606eaafb35c53bc01368e45fe88d82e889 she asked, as though suddenly thinking of it.
0x620e34a67ad96c2f539a874ee28f26a59a7b5323 he did not at first understand the question.
0x1930b502091521fa4d4b618f2e761430d2f5c53b “no, of course not.
0x263b3fa38bb581b6457b9bfdf8481ed1a964e137 here, take this one, of cypress wood.
0x3c7a250605f4cb97baca10a537b3cc51bd821d14 i have another, a copper one that belonged to lizaveta.
0x7f62376f7ca64f1e2ad901019a151cc078a78b08 i changed with lizaveta: she gave me her cross and i gave her my little ikon.

0xb6a1631f86124df49a5fa09bb961fcccff93b12c it’s mine, you know,” she begged him.
0x832094a53e8366d1cfcf09fe93616b14e67a6a59 “we will go to suffer together, and together we will bear our cross!”
0xa14995906f80223137a91c84d6277cd2ff1e029b “give it me,” said raskolnikov.
0x42a585b520c662c8b1acf1e7d92ebce69b010b47 he did not want to hurt her feelings.
0x1fc8a0a4e9d359d74a4b23c82fffe8d94d52aed9 but immediately he drew back the hand he held out for the cross.
0xda013c1b7b09a6449e506170550914f0befc7e75 “not now, sonia.
0xd3a31ddf36571cb722d9632158210eb94645a80a better later,” he added to comfort her.
0xfaf45036ebe47f535ce49bbafbc6896c1ce68031 “yes, yes, better,” she repeated with conviction, “when you go to meet your suffering, then put it on.
0xfe07cd49debba64fedb388367c568f9b50e1018e you will come to me, i’ll put it on you, we will pray and go together.”
0x06aa710cbc66b70ade23d16f177df47bcf461364 at that moment someone knocked three times at the door.
0xc8e9f13e1679cd4d9945552f24ae4817457727d5 “sofya semyonovna, may i come in?”
0xea1324d45488e017a44d2e645c66d67c68904511 they heard in a very familiar and polite voice.
0xa81fb9d51205d0ec85a8ff5428fcba707fc9fc0a sonia rushed to the door in a fright.
0x6a2feef5cdb1ee4c8dcd678cef3bd1c8fd8e706a the flaxen head of mr. lebeziatnikov appeared at the door.
0xc5f616951c08ed4de04f5a3e8ea27a8c0a254825 chapter v lebeziatnikov looked perturbed.
0x2248cc5bcee8093d9e2175c588ba79ac5891b4dc “i’ve come to you, sofya semyonovna,” he began.
0xe072a95fb9d94c3fb816cd206b2c353b80f0371b “excuse me... i thought i should find you,” he said, addressing raskolnikov suddenly, “that is, i didn’t mean anything... of that sort... but i just thought... katerina ivanovna has gone out of her mind,” he blurted out suddenly, turning from raskolnikov to sonia.
0x0bde0e0cf68b11f4bc8b349577097a173100508b sonia screamed.
0x3b98a8b49d70ea787db4ac06c097c55a61a870a1 “at least it seems so.
0x4f83b7d5d58c4a16ca01c27ca11b9ad26da89955 but... we don’t know what to do, you see!
0x0b4323c97c81bb90529e6b38fb48d03357ba1135 she came back--she seems to have been turned out somewhere, perhaps beaten.... so it seems at least,... she had run to your father’s former chief, she didn’t find him at home: he was dining at some other general’s.... only fancy, she rushed off there, to the other general’s, and, imagine, she was so persistent that she managed to get the chief to see her, had him fetched out from dinner, it seems.
0x10d13534d6cb8d3f914410c8f731c3a806836b8e you can imagine what happened.
0x33c7a73cc2747570c3e714cd71d2a5b24b6b0429 she was turned out, of course; but, according to her own story, she abused him and threw something at him.
0xf5144641f3c84143df9127cd73acafcff1e5b197 one may well believe it.... how it is she wasn’t taken up, i can’t understand!
0x1b55c25856ef8ae8639468b34179bfa41efa85eb now she is telling everyone, including amalia ivanovna; but it’s difficult to understand her, she is screaming and flinging herself about.... oh yes, she shouts that since everyone has abandoned her, she will take the children and go into the street with a barrel-organ, and the children will sing and dance, and she too, and collect money, and will go every day under the general’s window... ‘to let everyone see well-born children, whose father was an official, begging in the street.’
0x329147df7b9e7d545b58dbd912af208a011a1a41 she keeps beating the children and they are all crying.
0x2311122beaf04c0747c74fc652f07cc358471c21 she is teaching lida to sing ‘my village,’ the boy to dance, polenka the same.
0x41203bee1bb72403b5e8055ac5b35ca3315d5fdd she is tearing up all the clothes, and making them little caps like actors; she means to carry a tin basin and make it tinkle, instead of music.... she won’t listen to anything.... imagine the state of things!
0x28e2316be13a07c4906458224c81a9996b662140 it’s beyond anything!”
0xadcdd51bc61e6f6a9d15c9cd069575226c005e2c lebeziatnikov would have gone on, but sonia, who had heard him almost breathless, snatched up her cloak and hat, and ran out of the room, putting on her things as she went.
0x28afa74fccc41f05cb25d86e113f364ef8386327 raskolnikov followed her and lebeziatnikov came after him.
0xd837c62f4e254e87bbb6737d74802a655a37701e “she has certainly gone mad!”
0x82c94ca223b84c01fc5142cbe182829c10a6fb3e he said to raskolnikov, as they went out into the street.
0x1365fd484785ff5360f892048583ec9412fab6c5 “i didn’t want to frighten sofya semyonovna, so i said ‘it seemed like it,’ but there isn’t a doubt of it.
0x759762b318c520b5e8e3f412e36c51c2d87e0718 they say that in consumption the tubercles sometimes occur in the brain; it’s a pity i know nothing of medicine.
0xfae5529b5f04411ea71434018e6cd82c584426bc i did try to persuade her, but she wouldn’t listen.”
0x5e82156f8eeb438aebd4d45fc1b0b461deff0c67 “did you talk to her about the tubercles?”
0x174dbea7a1bdc33e15ec00b0dc70642bbbabc889 “not precisely of the tubercles.
0x60896adb0e9edc2097427760633f1a41bf9504a3 besides, she wouldn’t have understood!
0x23971fc421ec002915a79facc0339b16e9597726 but what i say is, that if you convince a person logically that he has nothing to cry about, he’ll stop crying.
0x39d358fc454c1b712c519cdb9e5d7b7955469b72 that’s clear.
0x1f6b41b76650bb5a5f5c1d7a083683c9f22cd40c is it your conviction that he won’t?”
0x71bcee7d52fefcd71b8e5954cbbe38febcea3bb0 “life would be too easy if it were so,” answered raskolnikov.
0xa450060788473a6d3795c57897d202340868135b “excuse me, excuse me; of course it would be rather difficult for katerina ivanovna to understand, but do you know that in paris they have been conducting serious experiments as to the possibility of curing the insane, simply by logical argument?
0x9dd99560ee7905fcef0424f0130866fa50caafaa one professor there, a scientific man of standing, lately dead, believed in the possibility of such treatment.
0x3abe0494921d7150d37ee948b7a35bb081689af3 his idea was that there’s nothing really wrong with the physical organism of the insane, and that insanity is, so to say, a logical mistake, an error of judgment, an incorrect view of things.
0xb8e65187ed9024abced6d73c780902fef98e0d55 he gradually showed the madman his error and, would you believe it, they say he was successful?
0x6f0fc4e738b0250d13999dc6259b49bd184ae9c5 but as he made use of douches too, how far success was due to that treatment remains uncertain.... so it seems at least.”
0x0c2da18bf14c9d39a1f271c5ef4e5498052eaf96 raskolnikov had long ceased to listen.
0xfde10ae29720eef69ac46f1b2134b72e885a216e reaching the house where he lived, he nodded to lebeziatnikov and went in at the gate.
0x4a75193b2dabfe3dfd06c8649ddde6598b6b7fe8 lebeziatnikov woke up with a start, looked about him and hurried on.
0x8f82e344fcc96af63d87c5b84c96c07d225f3cea raskolnikov went into his little room and stood still in the middle of it.
0xb70c25d86ba47ca67e33d08d79a3fb5111455591 why had he come back here?
0xaac90938c2c308796a8e8a839e31be6d2185c598 he looked at the yellow and tattered paper, at the dust, at his sofa.... from the yard came a loud continuous knocking; someone seemed to be hammering... he went to the window, rose on tiptoe and looked out into the yard for a long time with an air of absorbed attention.
0xb7075712898a883e48bbe1703f0e276c1cc611e8 but the yard was empty and he could not see who was hammering.
0x480a6e263449348bb5bb22b18915eec7773f12cd in the house on the left he saw some open windows; on the window-sills were pots of sickly-looking geraniums.
0xa2e157647f50f126030d919cf6c7d97c819d4156 linen was hung out of the windows... he knew it all by heart.
0x311d853499d984ae4cf7647f16f1b1a59e34fadf he turned away and sat down on the sofa.
0x8410073c3ec60adde0daa3aa2ec2b1b7b365875f never, never had he felt himself so fearfully alone!
0xae77adcb87ce83cca8c1658049167c1ab5710843 yes, he felt once more that he would perhaps come to hate sonia, now that he had made her more miserable.
0xc93ac9886982ed4042960675de80fe8be052ef8b “why had he gone to her to beg for her tears?
0x5b56d1f9118f0fde11b4bb1248aa6ba5bd7f3fa4 what need had he to poison her life?
0x80375417d577cd7f974f455cc2a2551fc7bb3253 oh, the meanness of it!”
0x234c543a908b61884e43631bf8ecfbfa368f3726 “i will remain alone,” he said resolutely, “and she shall not come to the prison!”
0x401b72355b64374c9aed40398540d113e17c04b3 five minutes later he raised his head with a strange smile.
0xeafb14886016e4d26304fdc95dce17cdf9da5c96 that was a strange thought.
0x6c8befb9d3d4d42ee460ce88b8226ae0727aa50d “perhaps it really would be better in siberia,” he thought suddenly.
0x192b3614add2f2f858c91d2ce036f82fd2ce1b37 he could not have said how long he sat there with vague thoughts surging through his mind.
0x2b20d0eee9e6f54f10dbdc25d650065d653f860b all at once the door opened and dounia came in.
0x163a3cacfe5181c38249bb3b169f75083a6b6517 at first she stood still and looked at him from the doorway, just as he had done at sonia; then she came in and sat down in the same place as yesterday, on the chair facing him.
0xa37d46b351c7fd88d63db328bccdc6a81742bdc4 he looked silently and almost vacantly at her.
0x38a470916341178cd13572d20a21e200b2033661 “don’t be angry, brother; i’ve only come for one minute,” said dounia.
0xff6004e946fd42f9db2aa975449031a88595238c her face looked thoughtful but not stern.
0x10e35149b873788182fcee668163b92cfc5020f5 her eyes were bright and soft.
0x2baa6b20cec415354b17f90843ac2ef5bea42a8f he saw that she too had come to him with love.

0x5eaf432d0da8fc26e9c1c8698d1203c71e7604fc as for your cutting yourself off from us, i don’t judge you, i don’t venture to judge you, and forgive me for having blamed you for it.
0x145e87352ec1a457ecd5cf663221e4f8cc9685ba i feel that i too, if i had so great a trouble, should keep away from everyone.
0xaed720d8eafb36ab2de597c724bbc1301a2b1659 i shall tell mother nothing _of this_, but i shall talk about you continually and shall tell her from you that you will come very soon.
0x839e7931b19d8f156ca30b56a11c2793ac59e210 don’t worry about her; _i_ will set her mind at rest; but don’t you try her too much--come once at least; remember that she is your mother.
0xd8f40ae0ec1e3f102a0d2ef235a09a5a6e8dba59 and now i have come simply to say” (dounia began to get up) “that if you should need me or should need... all my life or anything... call me, and i’ll come.
0x7cd42f9696b71b22476e4f6adb5fcb8aa68153a8 good-bye!”
0xb82fb3daf3a8cab6407ca7447e1fc6e96b4b5e84 she turned abruptly and went towards the door.
0x36642bdb6cd23e4642ec3e55dcc8d33ba1fed9de “dounia!”
0xb5284233bf56fa4ac97f12096d50b3ef0e6c672b raskolnikov stopped her and went towards her.
0x20d12780499da8aa10fdbb8e2c0e4d9309658cb0 “that razumihin, dmitri prokofitch, is a very good fellow.”
0x840d79bf65926ce6b82190951558dab9ac1d3b4b dounia flushed slightly.
0xeb72f99e0fb55a4aab85ee2cbbbf005118624953 “well?”
0xe7a75f7a13ef5482002e53d606e25faeb90d519f she asked, waiting a moment.
0x36b922e99a06808e7a9f600638f0c2ffbb636298 “he is competent, hardworking, honest and capable of real love.... good-bye, dounia.”
0x69757409bdb4210d12e03283fd10c96f19100a55 dounia flushed crimson, then suddenly she took alarm.
0x1c6e324279ea88b96e14051893d602a9fe0d69c5 “but what does it mean, brother?
0x5f8c3a8f6c5ac95bb2caf443feb34976a4822cde are we really parting for ever that you... give me such a parting message?”
0x846498ee851beec17788b00a3c11b6257f20dd16 “never mind.... good-bye.”
0x9df5923f6089a6601c3e1322d4440dfa3ccb0306 he turned away, and walked to the window.
0xd4bf0c12bf0227a133bbee8678e3187e1b7c36cc she stood a moment, looked at him uneasily, and went out troubled.
0x10e6d6c350a4871ef2eff53f71ead2b8484b7e96 no, he was not cold to her.
0xb3e7f7d8f55785da3a08d9d4cf7536fd95be38f9 there was an instant (the very last one) when he had longed to take her in his arms and _say good-bye_ to her, and even _to tell_ her, but he had not dared even to touch her hand.
0x2a3c1184697d3ab869c4459bf06072c6913210d7 “afterwards she may shudder when she remembers that i embraced her, and will feel that i stole her kiss.”
0x3f4f7d7c55e7607cad663d7b8a594f870c91b16b “and would _she_ stand that test?”
0x0350b42383fe66eebd0f963fb31585a483fd19ff he went on a few minutes later to himself.
0x11bca5b78a2fcd362832b7caf88022ef4c287ef8 “no, she wouldn’t; girls like that can’t stand things!
0x5aa3f0167f3e00eecf9b487b520017c55f6ca72b they never do.”
0x85a89718a8424e0641cf296484144962a89130bc and he thought of sonia.
0x8b9612701c3f41aabfc3d06ff26dbaab7719ca21 there was a breath of fresh air from the window.
0x6d035fd49ab54ba3c8f90f73589fcf5a15f4a9d4 the daylight was fading.
0x6b53e369766ef82416fd129b3fa079e74b757d4a he took up his cap and went out.
0x3ce0946f1590fb58f2a5ebba9be7df31de29e791 he could not, of course, and would not consider how ill he was.
0x24d88f1e02d7fb94095306989fdea8a41d9c8aa0 but all this continual anxiety and agony of mind could not but affect him.
0x7e5e2bdd03bde57b614538c5d854b859149a19f6 and if he were not lying in high fever it was perhaps just because this continual inner strain helped to keep him on his legs and in possession of his faculties.
0xdb879d9f8e04b48fa14267f6ae318fb5f54de4ff but this artificial excitement could not last long.
0xe11bdc235a12259141a27e11428f9516eadedec3 he wandered aimlessly.
0x4414484951d9fccc14a2ce458b656e5a4840cfcb the sun was setting.
0xdaf1883e218b224625b08ac5441718d45555540c a special form of misery had begun to oppress him of late.
0x9937a0bf26ed7b9b4e9ac64bb41bbb7deaf9a2c6 there was nothing poignant, nothing acute about it; but there was a feeling of permanence, of eternity about it; it brought a foretaste of hopeless years of this cold leaden misery, a foretaste of an eternity “on a square yard of space.”
0x8b6addba83943cf04210d044b14f6de69039756d towards evening this sensation usually began to weigh on him more heavily.
0x57464c120068a789b8f160f97e9d202841c4e92a “with this idiotic, purely physical weakness, depending on the sunset or something, one can’t help doing something stupid!
0x21dfea86582c6531a5cde9eacd72c4d595d3415e you’ll go to dounia, as well as to sonia,” he muttered bitterly.
0xfd868723fcb681a5f97bff2232894e1c3a68d6fb he heard his name called.
0x0a35cc64b0427adcd6ef7d2d28678f372884dc7d he looked round.
0xfa2ab4e870a587ee008a98660452ce77e28daaf6 lebeziatnikov rushed up to him.
0xe238fe1176a41f78d5c04ff3189d3e94ea5a54d9 “only fancy, i’ve been to your room looking for you.
0xef289f494613fd19e8ec7f3bfa3eb3e5b6171442 only fancy, she’s carried out her plan, and taken away the children.
0xcf1940998a99fcfd43a8db1ee23989b36e04e27a sofya semyonovna and i have had a job to find them.
0x717ce400ee59aeb967514392bd790d30619adacc she is rapping on a frying-pan and making the children dance.
0xccf129d36fb84a104d51d5032d2f5e731be0a7b1 the children are crying.
0x1786a98833900dea6f6bd6c5ee1675418b3ceaa4 they keep stopping at the cross-roads and in front of shops; there’s a crowd of fools running after them.
0x3849d73a65e6a6c2c728a0dbe965f394d6194f0c come along!”
0x152253458a1cdfca795f10ec11d7b3367d581976 “and sonia?”
0xd2c83635a4feb9acdcaa251205ecd0785bdd7ba4 raskolnikov asked anxiously, hurrying after lebeziatnikov.
0x95a197c81953943e294ece6162487622ad86fcc1 “simply frantic.
0xd7c0d9fa06bef5891a8361ec68be77638438e3d6 that is, it’s not sofya semyonovna’s frantic, but katerina ivanovna, though sofya semyonova’s frantic too.
0x75cc05156bc9558a99aa9f7e3a9a2e2d37ae3078 but katerina ivanovna is absolutely frantic.
0x543a9238c27125a74636cc49c6fef7a0a0897dcc i tell you she is quite mad.
0xbf4de8e4b2b09a9cd8ccca4360118ce1321afdd5 they’ll be taken to the police.
0xe4c5f09662dd469920ebe6ddac357a7a26c17362 you can fancy what an effect that will have.... they are on the canal bank, near the bridge now, not far from sofya semyonovna’s, quite close.”
0x4cba2028ece67c12c207de7af49a2c7cc44ca43e on the canal bank near the bridge and not two houses away from the one where sonia lodged, there was a crowd of people, consisting principally of gutter children.
0x92df631ae7b5f90d859c0679df62578321944ae4 the hoarse broken voice of katerina ivanovna could be heard from the bridge, and it certainly was a strange spectacle likely to attract a street crowd.
0x31edbbd732d5e64dadd7c3112063623dd9610a4c katerina ivanovna in her old dress with the green shawl, wearing a torn straw hat, crushed in a hideous way on one side, was really frantic.
0x1e653c89d28a3c41b555dd31a1e63ecae910803b she was exhausted and breathless.
0xaac7a39a4f58efc098a91fa7a7fdb28813e90bdb her wasted consumptive face looked more suffering than ever, and indeed out of doors in the sunshine a consumptive always looks worse than at home.
0x0eb2f17e9d1e6a9a96b593086f092feaeff37a2b but her excitement did not flag, and every moment her irritation grew more intense.
0x31811454df198abcf6376616f506acffe2ada6f8 she rushed at the children, shouted at them, coaxed them, told them before the crowd how to dance and what to sing, began explaining to them why it was necessary, and driven to desperation by their not understanding, beat them.... then she would make a rush at the crowd; if she noticed any decently dressed person stopping to look, she immediately appealed to him to see what these children “from a genteel, one may say aristocratic, house” had been brought to.
0x3e5eeedbc20a62d43eda8c135331cc11210f82da if she heard laughter or jeering in the crowd, she would rush at once at the scoffers and begin squabbling with them.
0xfa575404af537cc11a0851189280e0610cee282a some people laughed, others shook their heads, but everyone felt curious at the sight of the madwoman with the frightened children.
0x0f65fd906237bb33b0e0089892b335a145305ed8 the frying-pan of which lebeziatnikov had spoken was not there, at least raskolnikov did not see it.
0xb8a57a2322405d318a8e7e56515735e145732db4 but instead of rapping on the pan, katerina ivanovna began clapping her wasted hands, when she made lida and kolya dance and polenka sing.
0xd7adaec26051d7d52cdfd30863755d6c1b74c47c she too joined in the singing, but broke down at the second note with a fearful cough, which made her curse in despair and even shed tears.
0xefddcd197c8751609f069d025cdc2bcf618b5e6d what made her most furious was the weeping and terror of kolya and lida.
0x64bac8ee9f24783ff74a10b6809223563e970790 some effort had been made to dress the children up as street singers are dressed.
0x9da3c1d13f140934ace9a3697bf3ccdd654653f3 the boy had on a turban made of something red and white to look like a turk.
0xdedf94065aecc7889ae109a1862be1994fe4cbc4 there had been no costume for lida; she simply had a red knitted cap, or rather a night cap that had belonged to marmeladov, decorated with a broken piece of white ostrich feather, which had been katerina ivanovna’s grandmother’s and had been preserved as a family possession.
0x1ca355d6996745bdee6ecc6fdeaf1daf789766f1 polenka was in her everyday dress; she looked in timid perplexity at her mother, and kept at her side, hiding her tears.
0x9837bac95582bedd13cd15a48966f4701e8a6f17 she dimly realised her mother’s condition, and looked uneasily about her.
0x267e6ef0970f5816fd76ce3d8c864a582ba398cb she was terribly frightened of the street and the crowd.
0xc5ae65280f0079e0932fbcbf05fe23e759152d71 sonia followed katerina ivanovna, weeping and beseeching her to return home, but katerina ivanovna was not to be persuaded.
0xf70d3ed2c06916f92b4a5555c449c5d5030dcd52 “leave off, sonia, leave off,” she shouted, speaking fast, panting and coughing.
0xd1123489bd6b995532e75bf369db620ddbfcfb50 “you don’t know what you ask; you are like a child!
0x82506586f762921ca03ceb15a94ec9ceeca1a2be i’ve told you before that i am not coming back to that drunken german.
0x8c292cd8f644629388c7f252a30ad98969d1ea2e let everyone, let all petersburg see the children begging in the streets, though their father was an honourable man who served all his life in truth and fidelity, and one may say died in the service.”
0x1829ccf781c9b45ecf1d875b4fa09358b812b63a (katerina ivanovna had by now invented this fantastic story and thoroughly believed it.)
0xca4b6b021990bc06ce4392740fd6978ac152fc74 “let that wretch of a general see it!
0x8b82fc424ca072e059bab9387307ccde5fe95040 and you are silly, sonia: what have we to eat?
0x20d70231e0209552cb7eaf880d48afa45afc39d1 tell me that.
0x71933bf3e8970628764042f3abe5b7b5acd53cc3 we have worried you enough, i won’t go on so!
0x27322bdae117aefa4990be7c07e4d23b5cdd9551 ah, rodion romanovitch, is that you?”
0x1984947dd31082372403b04cf15ce9c029acc052 she cried, seeing raskolnikov and rushing up to him.
0xcd5066ce099df768c2cc02d89b7b52dbb2acb05d “explain to this silly girl, please, that nothing better could be done!
0x6df92ad438a136a502fdf792fd5f6f46d1b2a7b8 even organ-grinders earn their living, and everyone will see at once that we are different, that we are an honourable and bereaved family reduced to beggary.
0x1003f958b88d248a2d82cf24983acc76270b235f and that general will lose his post, you’ll see!
0x9f45714d8b40af659219cfb4b6abcf1afc93bfa1 we shall perform under his windows every day, and if the tsar drives by, i’ll fall on my knees, put the children before me, show them to him, and say ‘defend us father.’
0x2404de9daa74320eab24e5183900c1d2202fb8bd he is the father of the fatherless, he is merciful, he’ll protect us, you’ll see, and that wretch of a general.... lida, _tenez vous droite_!
0x33d63547c87cf7172734d1e89670535f6a615b95 kolya, you’ll dance again.
0x7575f4bde8c7498d65e0187606cbfd0892421551 why are you whimpering?
0xc017c97a331c42c7a74f4ccc341712e5a1a22580 whimpering again!
0xce6b117bec5c619360d4762e1ad745bfd1e93df9 what are you afraid of, stupid?
0xa9485fd680f4c3153f16075a267c8d8c32e4a097 goodness, what am i to do with them, rodion romanovitch?
0x015c8e0fe518db736cdf739aab7e8e47e4ea4174 if you only knew how stupid they are!
0x6a458a5718c47b429376f6543bd6f12dfc50da03 what’s one to do with such children?”
0x05b066b2f9a5fe7f93f797ccef527158c5dc1821 and she, almost crying herself--which did not stop her uninterrupted, rapid flow of talk--pointed to the crying children.
0x51e7623efba56467edf184c933ac60d5022602eb raskolnikov tried to persuade her to go home, and even said, hoping to work on her vanity, that it was unseemly for her to be wandering about the streets like an organ-grinder, as she was intending to become the principal of a boarding-school.
0xbc4220cca7be7ab9957d91b4ad18d626032c3f74 “a boarding-school, ha-ha-ha!
0xcd29922d5abd8a9a761982ef7d6778c957a5e448 a castle in the air,” cried katerina ivanovna, her laugh ending in a cough.
0x49bed08c73514bcc7d21e0e2b9601a92cf060ac7 “no, rodion romanovitch, that dream is over!

0x0dc37158aade185b41cce75344700c40a3567c9c she pointed to sonia.
0xb8a48ed915528d6638a47e40ea70f14d79c605a2 “polenka, how much have you got?

0x78d628530c8f6b42ae9f88444509635cc020c7a8 (she pointed to a man in the crowd.)
0x589c4834b1b231b486ca3093bb7dda63ddda0361 “it’s all because kolya here is so stupid; i have such a bother with him.

0xfee0a52dd2b45665f38a06d5a7ad7c67f257f8c6 else how are you to show that you are of good family, well brought-up children, and not at all like other organ-grinders?

0xac738c7f5969944421a3d59912d8bb5e084481f2 lida knows ‘my village’ only, nothing but ‘my village,’ and everyone sings that.
0x4f09aae8d13eb0ab2f130df2c1e020a717a43281 we must sing something far more genteel.... well, have you thought of anything, polenka?

0xc4c0719db3e3dc10f18d0f3bb2128ac085b045a5 a policeman was indeed forcing his way through the crowd.
0x01fe9e1bba496028277866684ef85c866ccc51c5 but at that moment a gentleman in civilian uniform and an overcoat--a solid-looking official of about fifty with a decoration on his neck (which delighted katerina ivanovna and had its effect on the policeman)--approached and without a word handed her a green three-rouble note.
0xb7f05a26cca247396baf631fb53df00426a1bbbb his face wore a look of genuine sympathy.

0x4de386fcae62c6bc4ec656902230e6e73122cc0d kolya and lida, scared out of their wits by the crowd, and their mother’s mad pranks, suddenly seized each other by the hand, and ran off at the sight of the policeman who wanted to take them away somewhere.
0xc5045456710a6a7fefdd3981d1c4b1a234dea127 weeping and wailing, poor katerina ivanovna ran after them.
0x65e8cd26280c74eaac9f5cb8154af52c83b64ae9 she was a piteous and unseemly spectacle, as she ran, weeping and panting for breath.
0x7a65816715c9e022b6d30bca67b492d1a5b33a14 sonia and polenka rushed after them.

0x9bef281e88279cfe9c4b3f65387ef6e8a82e16f7 cried sonia, bending over her.
0x1ffb6f34def907a09cdf601556db5e0a8fa6b3c4 all ran up and crowded around.
0x8086a487cb119d6ca10f28c677dc27dd9c5c3594 raskolnikov and lebeziatnikov were the first at her side, the official too hastened up, and behind him the policeman who muttered, “bother!”
0x73b4d8b95acf1857b87942125cf4c0388f2bf267 with a gesture of impatience, feeling that the job was going to be a troublesome one.
0x204512962b890a9af906cac57180c80c7175a296 “pass on!

0xeae696de885562d541b363f72b28d47d56b52cbb he said to the crowd that pressed forward.
0x4fd53121c7b06cb58cbbf687aeed5ade615f5b02 “she’s dying,” someone shouted.
0xd5c4df4444bd0b45ee00a0f11322d8dd7ceb6998 “she’s gone out of her mind,” said another.
0x67643a33af8930ac1059d3df8086b0d1a68f2f29 “lord have mercy upon us,” said a woman, crossing herself.
0x13fa75bea1dfea9363204d1777d84894509aa476 “have they caught the little girl and the boy?
0x4dacaac1fc665d8915b9d0737bf44c5a42a2d9e5 they’re being brought back, the elder one’s got them.... ah, the naughty imps!”
0x6bf7beb6287c5082f0909d1e99cabf6a85564258 when they examined katerina ivanovna carefully, they saw that she had not cut herself against a stone, as sonia thought, but that the blood that stained the pavement red was from her chest.
0xae064b8b6115e2f8ab0f4cb738165aed1d96fe90 “i’ve seen that before,” muttered the official to raskolnikov and lebeziatnikov; “that’s consumption; the blood flows and chokes the patient.
0x7f36ef9233ae469e80f640f386eeb560e99d40f8 i saw the same thing with a relative of my own not long ago... nearly a pint of blood, all in a minute.... what’s to be done though?

0x8718d2c087033df016cde2266238a113dd36b732 sonia implored.
0x5bf963b67baacefd3da2bf71fa80be920df986a3 “i live here!... see, that house, the second from here.... come to me, make haste,” she turned from one to the other.
0xfa27dcf96b33427f7f73b31556098c8f4f179d2b “send for the doctor!
0x6848f7d15d630d3a5a306db57e03d644a580038d oh, dear!”
0x7887e3da0a6e958a83293cf8f4cccccf258b6e1e thanks to the official’s efforts, this plan was adopted, the policeman even helping to carry katerina ivanovna.
0xc41bc6c3bf0f8396acd2db99ac5997790772b71a she was carried to sonia’s room, almost unconscious, and laid on the bed.
0x62ed3ead411e5b6f690ae5b2b3bb3e5c97625c49 the blood was still flowing, but she seemed to be coming to herself.
0x97e89da878dcc485c9464beef5931807f1ad3184 raskolnikov, lebeziatnikov, and the official accompanied sonia into the room and were followed by the policeman, who first drove back the crowd which followed to the very door.
0xf8e0532503edb45f8521034c5497adb9948c1f21 polenka came in holding kolya and lida, who were trembling and weeping.
0x341fd459d79b40f6e4baa41920e666362257c3b0 several persons came in too from the kapernaumovs’ room; the landlord, a lame one-eyed man of strange appearance with whiskers and hair that stood up like a brush, his wife, a woman with an everlastingly scared expression, and several open-mouthed children with wonder-struck faces.
0xc5b29e9f2e971ef7eb51f7c7b80df39f054c996f among these, svidrigaïlov suddenly made his appearance.
0xc6ce99e04f23b5d6af346bbc883e9529d6a15c55 raskolnikov looked at him with surprise, not understanding where he had come from and not having noticed him in the crowd.
0xc5af27526b30938763894800529c4a22e8940774 a doctor and priest wore spoken of.
0x897c3d2d90e164fd46ba7c70cb807b324681f853 the official whispered to raskolnikov that he thought it was too late now for the doctor, but he ordered him to be sent for.
0xa201b38571b712827be214cc5f9511beebb40d5d kapernaumov ran himself.
0x496fc4a7bd049d526b3140c5d5539d057f97c7c3 meanwhile katerina ivanovna had regained her breath.
0x60fe23886bc4b279240767723003642df710b435 the bleeding ceased for a time.
0xfd64131e62f40a53d71cd912e25a647783796771 she looked with sick but intent and penetrating eyes at sonia, who stood pale and trembling, wiping the sweat from her brow with a handkerchief.
0x2a1747693d9a11ac337b9fae4922b11764d2e3fb at last she asked to be raised.
0x85481e203acb44c4ab6e608836d4363c470b168e they sat her up on the bed, supporting her on both sides.
0x6be7d5ff4a03415bed0eead8fe9bf7cea97b1f4e “where are the children?”

0x8d0f59e22f55918a0b784739414e3e9a3d5f6356 they laid her back on the pillow.

0x449046988b76b02bbe321e7ca605b91a0b857b48 her breathing was hoarse and difficult, there was a sort of rattle in her throat.

0x93cd1fed4102c85fbdda43a729090e6b604c9762 “sonia, sonia!”
0xabff0af8e4e860bd1a1c917a94ac6d228d607e36 she articulated softly and caressingly, as though surprised to find her there.
0x4ed59580cdb12272cd87fb54005d76481fe7ba80 “sonia darling, are you here, too?”
0xbf149fe40bab43e8c8c996c49b8d2940e13deca8 they lifted her up again.
0xdad7c68657314e788f57cf838e09748ddc4364a1 “enough!

0xca5137e87f84157863db529e161137a74a78fc64 she cried with vindictive despair, and her head fell heavily back on the pillow.
0x86c4e251e130355379dfc2c7220c281d7954bd03 she sank into unconsciousness again, but this time it did not last long.
0x6a43af5232ad47f169c4f09399e5db0b285c549a her pale, yellow, wasted face dropped back, her mouth fell open, her leg moved convulsively, she gave a deep, deep sigh and died.
0xb8d3dcf83653203faee888a9c924706a533e89a1 sonia fell upon her, flung her arms about her, and remained motionless with her head pressed to the dead woman’s wasted bosom.
0xfa71b56fbe5bafd1d462d064436c17b113022b12 polenka threw herself at her mother’s feet, kissing them and weeping violently.
0x24a6de099172f356de940272b4815d4812bcaafe though kolya and lida did not understand what had happened, they had a feeling that it was something terrible; they put their hands on each other’s little shoulders, stared straight at one another and both at once opened their mouths and began screaming.
0x565ddbae9600bcfcb2cf5f0d680663f08366b257 they were both still in their fancy dress; one in a turban, the other in the cap with the ostrich feather.
0x55ba12cf90f23b798a9880f8a9d551c1d0c110cb and how did “the certificate of merit” come to be on the bed beside katerina ivanovna?
0x0fa49a01cd719315eac092101e32282b30d9752c it lay there by the pillow; raskolnikov saw it.
0xdbf086b98875b66c1b5d9ad775a1795f4ee02760 he walked away to the window.
0x32949918c1a0af6f4e1522b903177d4eb9e1552d lebeziatnikov skipped up to him.
0x36f34119f13c820f8b48ae95d8bc0680aee13bce “she is dead,” he said.
0x1e01e40eea70045889a69a8d953d45a7de2c2541 “rodion romanovitch, i must have two words with you,” said svidrigaïlov, coming up to them.
0x1a0daa8e576a9086dee573220c31d63853a2b0d3 lebeziatnikov at once made room for him and delicately withdrew.
0xff8f3034b599eb4ab63a868e04683c63041796d2 svidrigaïlov drew raskolnikov further away.
0xffb30b7d4adc946c206174f148fa6c0bb26d486a “i will undertake all the arrangements, the funeral and that.
0xabde7c5aec900a516c7873d7ebdededdae92c62d you know it’s a question of money and, as i told you, i have plenty to spare.

0xa5d0d4f2fc66149613cc65377fb9945ffb035c8d “what is your motive for such benevolence?”
0xfd03568d82921d86b84b1b32dd095b97f607a5b6 asked raskolnikov.
0x91ba30ea764a7db34ef0508ffb30ef7a725646ee “ah!
0xa5c5ad4feb862f4e01a1eac64cb6770afea651a1 you sceptical person!”
0x8d7f56f37bebebc8151b39254223400ed0f2cd83 laughed svidrigaïlov.
0x35bf32f2c74d675d43a26a2fa4a7e258532cdf59 “i told you i had no need of that money.
0x2ef119767a98ab3a4b67d2ef2108c7c43a643412 won’t you admit that it’s simply done from humanity?
0x0ecafec2e2e8de74f1dc5fd082deb43a9e303793 she wasn’t ‘a louse,’ you know” (he pointed to the corner where the dead woman lay), “was she, like some old pawnbroker woman?
0x982b198eff2b6dd16f05a6d836b5ad74f8ec9d12 come, you’ll agree, is luzhin to go on living, and doing wicked things or is she to die?
0x6cdc7870cd9b2a7613dd96c035ff6283ae9f773f and if i didn’t help them, polenka would go the same way.”
0x7566c1b725b90bf29aeae638faf194ba9de01be3 he said this with an air of a sort of gay winking slyness, keeping his eyes fixed on raskolnikov, who turned white and cold, hearing his own phrases, spoken to sonia.
0xc3a2048119e5648e18aaa2d90baa99b41148b50b he quickly stepped back and looked wildly at svidrigaïlov.
0x08ab23806f07bb992459d96e9a7d0ea5f0d97be8 “how do you know?”
0x6da44812b50598d20316d18612967a186604bff5 he whispered, hardly able to breathe.
0x332ec16481fafc8dd087fa3c7d1b9ba5123e2925 “why, i lodge here at madame resslich’s, the other side of the wall.

0xa54cfbb0d0c7aa040d5ef89ff9f938c691c354ec “you?”
0xea1d6d4159d035507cbf9ee784c1b9b5b6952b90 “yes,” continued svidrigaïlov, shaking with laughter.
0x22908f4b7c73482541f2aba1028eca7a0a18c7ca “i assure you on my honour, dear rodion romanovitch, that you have interested me enormously.

0x73a5e75660b4a5589fb76138f91458bfd9484f72 you’ll see that you can get on with me!”
0x262afd471663314f1c331d70cabc384a998a0412 part vi chapter i a strange period began for raskolnikov: it was as though a fog had fallen upon him and wrapped him in a dreary solitude from which there was no escape.
0x08d777d1b6839a6f10e9a8fc91a9060c5209bde8 recalling that period long after, he believed that his mind had been clouded at times, and that it had continued so, with intervals, till the final catastrophe.
0xa872ae419c1828afe7690428bd6f505bea2a3fc1 he was convinced that he had been mistaken about many things at that time, for instance as to the date of certain events.
0x253cd7bed353f6848dc83d5b64256d9dc62a47af anyway, when he tried later on to piece his recollections together, he learnt a great deal about himself from what other people told him.
0x0e77c20aec7cf6d0ecc31cf24b18773ec510a403 he had mixed up incidents and had explained events as due to circumstances which existed only in his imagination.
0x4f8438477badc76b2d221c21a79dcc9b54b67f83 at times he was a prey to agonies of morbid uneasiness, amounting sometimes to panic.
0xd6ca20fe9f712cad79b0433bc319a1dfba4a212b but he remembered, too, moments, hours, perhaps whole days, of complete apathy, which came upon him as a reaction from his previous terror and might be compared with the abnormal insensibility, sometimes seen in the dying.
0x05dabd49e26bfcda0ec15fc8860cabd693e73acf he seemed to be trying in that latter stage to escape from a full and clear understanding of his position.
0x1ec92cfe07fc2516adcf2acd01449e6c8746ab5a certain essential facts which required immediate consideration were particularly irksome to him.
0xdddc56144afcda222eeb7d93b30256a2a968248d how glad he would have been to be free from some cares, the neglect of which would have threatened him with complete, inevitable ruin.
0xa86c7d3bc7884bfca29ee37160370d22bb8e04ab he was particularly worried about svidrigaïlov, he might be said to be permanently thinking of svidrigaïlov.
0x181ee5238bb87d782a5a0b84cdd5fb4a682a01b4 from the time of svidrigaïlov’s too menacing and unmistakable words in sonia’s room at the moment of katerina ivanovna’s death, the normal working of his mind seemed to break down.
0x4ed9cff2612b27761259f0fb5965add9a12d0715 but although this new fact caused him extreme uneasiness, raskolnikov was in no hurry for an explanation of it.
0x7afe2030b8b1c102d21e03370e671fb23e51ee33 at times, finding himself in a solitary and remote part of the town, in some wretched eating-house, sitting alone lost in thought, hardly knowing how he had come there, he suddenly thought of svidrigaïlov.
0x07903019a09722a99e73f8918fa1e6cf31ca570a he recognised suddenly, clearly, and with dismay that he ought at once to come to an understanding with that man and to make what terms he could.
0x058aecc50fcfff2e9285cf016a537f7849b6b709 walking outside the city gates one day, he positively fancied that they had fixed a meeting there, that he was waiting for svidrigaïlov.
0x7687e9641bfa4d2760426569ef4de4138f810ddb another time he woke up before daybreak lying on the ground under some bushes and could not at first understand how he had come there.
0xa1e88414411ec63286455de1fa25208e81dbf7c0 but during the two or three days after katerina ivanovna’s death, he had two or three times met svidrigaïlov at sonia’s lodging, where he had gone aimlessly for a moment.
0xdce7a3ac5a6196bcf7510c5b32b400ed5035c23a they exchanged a few words and made no reference to the vital subject, as though they were tacitly agreed not to speak of it for a time.
0x5cd53b9031676cb3d9a16d0008b43d4bdc83361f katerina ivanovna’s body was still lying in the coffin, svidrigaïlov was busy making arrangements for the funeral.
0x36da3967125af4461cbcf44c15c6073da9178718 sonia too was very busy.
0xd5a6b0259380a50e771b36abc59a01e544672578 at their last meeting svidrigaïlov informed raskolnikov that he had made an arrangement, and a very satisfactory one, for katerina ivanovna’s children; that he had, through certain connections, succeeded in getting hold of certain personages by whose help the three orphans could be at once placed in very suitable institutions; that the money he had settled on them had been of great assistance, as it is much easier to place orphans with some property than destitute ones.
0x024c5ecd3ccaa1ecdea2c4292463e1282499a69c he said something too about sonia and promised to come himself in a day or two to see raskolnikov, mentioning that “he would like to consult with him, that there were things they must talk over....” this conversation took place in the passage on the stairs.
0x99cb41e1e4c81dc7006d1b70f29b9b409ed43a86 svidrigaïlov looked intently at raskolnikov and suddenly, after a brief pause, dropping his voice, asked: “but how is it, rodion romanovitch; you don’t seem yourself?
0xcd2f7097d9279c7e6eb3ef5d81fb7f3a5a7371db you look and you listen, but you don’t seem to understand.
0x9e6737984e17fe017715c3fa6f4bdc8214fd5e14 cheer up!
0x540c5554d5bfcf538e9c1a36cbcedf46fb2aa01e we’ll talk things over; i am only sorry, i’ve so much to do of my own business and other people’s.
0xef98402a41de3f86e50e934796af19a11a23b58f ah, rodion romanovitch,” he added suddenly, “what all men need is fresh air, fresh air... more than anything!”
0x6250ebfce0df55ef115a0b40881adbb4747810e8 he moved to one side to make way for the priest and server, who were coming up the stairs.
0xfe34b51ac7e5f68c50fc1822c6690ea657b4509c they had come for the requiem service.
0xa27470141bc4c3fcf9cf34caa58857281bf10079 by svidrigaïlov’s orders it was sung twice a day punctually.
0xf75965ce8139e30ca24c7f236473535fe76089d8 svidrigaïlov went his way.
0xd74180c6316bb4fc25e626c4027307c16b9f8a9e raskolnikov stood still a moment, thought, and followed the priest into sonia’s room.
0x4688468e3ee804811af6b0435093dd3c09c9b184 he stood at the door.
0x58660add67d593d03a1113b8d4ca668847271dc2 they began quietly, slowly and mournfully singing the service.
0xb18565ea3d69065f50bdf86c32c05180fe4c10a0 from his childhood the thought of death and the presence of death had something oppressive and mysteriously awful; and it was long since he had heard the requiem service.
0x36b4b8707954d32619b8404bac5e009b6ead5ef3 and there was something else here as well, too awful and disturbing.
0x237b753424582244340e4f8aa73e3154e8693b2b he looked at the children: they were all kneeling by the coffin; polenka was weeping.
0x476ede98a266a5a9a2f1225f5aeacbda3aa70ad2 behind them sonia prayed, softly and, as it were, timidly weeping.
0xe4657e45a49b0bbf83b41eb754a93aa75f9f644c “these last two days she hasn’t said a word to me, she hasn’t glanced at me,” raskolnikov thought suddenly.
0x0a41cf5171d7ef555e5b7fc641af87a7309a1b8a the sunlight was bright in the room; the incense rose in clouds; the priest read, “give rest, oh lord....” raskolnikov stayed all through the service.
0xacdd0e0aa78af12bdb02ccd6cd6f16977e55c399 as he blessed them and took his leave, the priest looked round strangely.
0x79ac91d7d6b380dea6d81cf1805b3093515838fc after the service, raskolnikov went up to sonia.
0x6a2e86f1195875d5b9c772e4a3b45edeb4fd06ed she took both his hands and let her head sink on his shoulder.
0x71bd31b901d3f550bd83f7744b4fc5597041628c this slight friendly gesture bewildered raskolnikov.
0xc78818825f5a4ec85123ead253b77c9e5086480a it seemed strange to him that there was no trace of repugnance, no trace of disgust, no tremor in her hand.
0x1be7f8f992ddb754b2884058fa4367570a4f75fe it was the furthest limit of self-abnegation, at least so he interpreted it.
0x28012c5c8e473e3aad6a90957ff03f86175530a2 sonia said nothing.
0x8174c8da23144e279ba1766a5935b452349490aa raskolnikov pressed her hand and went out.
0xa1d1ce12381386273aad041b74001a80ea0b58f1 he felt very miserable.
0x858032092bc6df86680ef732250f5e8166dfce89 if it had been possible to escape to some solitude, he would have thought himself lucky, even if he had to spend his whole life there.
0xbb05025c969b5cadc6cd86bae12feddbf48cd01c but although he had almost always been by himself of late, he had never been able to feel alone.
0xe95412dae204cb282f6e515bc6b24422972b5a13 sometimes he walked out of the town on to the high road, once he had even reached a little wood, but the lonelier the place was, the more he seemed to be aware of an uneasy presence near him.
0x3a5f77e8e39919089daa299ace4475089023b7c6 it did not frighten him, but greatly annoyed him, so that he made haste to return to the town, to mingle with the crowd, to enter restaurants and taverns, to walk in busy thoroughfares.
0x73674f79c8258f7644399ae02a05b1dac4a40c9c there he felt easier and even more solitary.
0xf36b2723974ec2431a97bab33ae80d5dbf97cfdf one day at dusk he sat for an hour listening to songs in a tavern and he remembered that he positively enjoyed it.
0x8167308d9d2fbc07c732fdcdc1ce83e23dc72ddb but at last he had suddenly felt the same uneasiness again, as though his conscience smote him.
0x8f8411a43b6bcdfe29f620dfa15bb037b64a1b51 “here i sit listening to singing, is that what i ought to be doing?”
0xf5eb9a7700c47f1c638e42f6143a3df6b0941693 he thought.
0x296ec9fa26015b70fee6a36885f27caa4c0cfc30 yet he felt at once that that was not the only cause of his uneasiness; there was something requiring immediate decision, but it was something he could not clearly understand or put into words.
0x888d0aa19671b79b61da1d2f0b75b642644462f1 it was a hopeless tangle.
0x41d07dbc2261024f476744fe8af88b8f89268c74 “no, better the struggle again!
0xef714836f6dc6edbf08895bdc49856ca84ac430e better porfiry again... or svidrigaïlov.... better some challenge again... some attack.
0x7f4ecf24d03c08ab14a2d96a6b3465fd7f9ebffc yes, yes!”
0xf5eb9a7700c47f1c638e42f6143a3df6b0941693 he thought.
0x1381fa0d5f8cf01c2442e09eccd32302664a12e8 he went out of the tavern and rushed away almost at a run.
0xa93a9615f48f4e6486c884545066c820d423a96c the thought of dounia and his mother suddenly reduced him almost to a panic.
0xc832883dfbeb0b924e80c225b0e9def88817192c that night he woke up before morning among some bushes in krestovsky island, trembling all over with fever; he walked home, and it was early morning when he arrived.
0x45c5c0803f756037f3ede98a2f8b6cf45a66a8f5 after some hours’ sleep the fever left him, but he woke up late, two o’clock in the afternoon.
0xfe2c4a5c13ce7e7443f437c21305c3fbdfce859e he remembered that katerina ivanovna’s funeral had been fixed for that day, and was glad that he was not present at it.
0xe6b4d16711b51f6c6e0f5d486e88e6b12fe1fd64 nastasya brought him some food; he ate and drank with appetite, almost with greediness.
0xb4501b02e5a9c4385fc701da96c00de949f0052a his head was fresher and he was calmer than he had been for the last three days.
0xcf1719728a97c4914989c42083c59065e75df1c1 he even felt a passing wonder at his previous attacks of panic.
0xfcb7e3269c344fcc572242baf02338fdd8391521 the door opened and razumihin came in.
0xcd78b4d5158cd51a40745d902f807c7ccd71e453 “ah, he’s eating, then he’s not ill,” said razumihin.
0xd1ae671499aa96ccb1f7ae7f8e4af95a49bf7ea0 he took a chair and sat down at the table opposite raskolnikov.
0x7376353d19a439cc5588d0322fc5d8c355803b48 he was troubled and did not attempt to conceal it.
0xf9fec2780803df59d25f6e7fa2ab0c3663403f60 he spoke with evident annoyance, but without hurry or raising his voice.
0xad9c4d0c95cf309c057d9493bafa8819f21ab9c8 he looked as though he had some special fixed determination.
0x8000a7e1eb98e446724d4ff1999054836e8c064c “listen,” he began resolutely.
0x52b161f58929e55dc8681e11317782e0511bd866 “as far as i am concerned, you may all go to hell, but from what i see, it’s clear to me that i can’t make head or tail of it; please don’t think i’ve come to ask you questions.
0x8ffea709d959403f98c7e5e8a0b55c20e3560c57 i don’t want to know, hang it!
0xa1a84bcf3577b82f4fc59513365348ccf7df0df9 if you begin telling me your secrets, i dare say i shouldn’t stay to listen, i should go away cursing.
0xf6ed7b8d1b44a26889f3e82470ebc17bfd98d008 i have only come to find out once for all whether it’s a fact that you are mad?
0x707a55cca04ccf56bd79760fd82a52556059d097 there is a conviction in the air that you are mad or very nearly so.
0x24329330c30e58ecca96cbfe5b27ad84189853cb i admit i’ve been disposed to that opinion myself, judging from your stupid, repulsive and quite inexplicable actions, and from your recent behavior to your mother and sister.
0x5721414ac9ad740b41d9745c81aea17634183b3d only a monster or a madman could treat them as you have; so you must be mad.”
0x98c65cefaf8d7aa778157fe62e2825bc0d73ca37 “when did you see them last?”
0x3b060eef3efb89be60aef775cfed8f388d175f9a “just now.
0x63f2b79befbe91b3f7928e13498ba2dc99a5942b haven’t you seen them since then?
0xfea1e2707a487a80e213edbf0e75ff2c0e69f4ba what have you been doing with yourself?
0x2f01804913b8e71c5b11e4544cb9d0f777fe4a6f tell me, please.
0xb66191ca6bdd7b8b4c5402bb570f2a8bc275a95a i’ve been to you three times already.
0x5c2943162245385318a817a1cdbfc4ef71ec50e6 your mother has been seriously ill since yesterday.
0xf38b3e80c97c1c8ad6b840b6b524b8ab91648d55 she had made up her mind to come to you; avdotya romanovna tried to prevent her; she wouldn’t hear a word.
0x78239e501ca56472fb972a6a2ea1cb1a8b962d36 ‘if he is ill, if his mind is giving way, who can look after him like his mother?’
0x872d64908de9411a7cda4720f080878bbc75efda she said.
0x0c0e7e54216928b62006c009c16d68dff3cfc691 we all came here together, we couldn’t let her come alone all the way.
0xd3ec7a6e9f652bed6487813af0e2f5bfb3d16a30 we kept begging her to be calm.
0x8a7ee497b7b0c90942c0db2d6849dd87594d38fa we came in, you weren’t here; she sat down, and stayed ten minutes, while we stood waiting in silence.
0x5e7e2094c26b41579df1021f491bc0c2a812a0a5 she got up and said: ‘if he’s gone out, that is, if he is well, and has forgotten his mother, it’s humiliating and unseemly for his mother to stand at his door begging for kindness.’
0x2526ea0743376ea595613ad81efea8c7d850aba1 she returned home and took to her bed; now she is in a fever.
0x7de9765890abdb9d7efde579c3d55823125aa111 ‘i see,’ she said, ‘that he has time for _his girl_.’
0x769a7126d716338dc5c74210cc84cbdbfc61556c she means by _your girl_ sofya semyonovna, your betrothed or your mistress, i don’t know.
0x9c556d9526b973601fc7e82c12b8d471ba53d1c1 i went at once to sofya semyonovna’s, for i wanted to know what was going on.
0xd7cb0107e8cdc13f859056d045caf98c283b0a28 i looked round, i saw the coffin, the children crying, and sofya semyonovna trying them on mourning dresses.
0x49a3b32d56b74a68767e7d50a484605e546b2dea no sign of you.
0xd1e03bed7dee4afef422361f502401fd26558f1e i apologised, came away, and reported to avdotya romanovna.
0xa655db1e15bd2c2daa677a4422370734dde2d8f9 so that’s all nonsense and you haven’t got a girl; the most likely thing is that you are mad.
0xd02adafcbb281ea3c791794551de364657abfb59 but here you sit, guzzling boiled beef as though you’d not had a bite for three days.
0x960e9a205b75dffd943c43c4e339e51c52e419ce though as far as that goes, madmen eat too, but though you have not said a word to me yet... you are not mad!
0x2a31c5bc33ffe896f985a28c078a62eb57ac717b that i’d swear!
0x2d5fc99a861dbf0cc5be4eaa73d1d09a5ea3b63c above all, you are not mad!
0xa47ea066b1ca03a5e9a6a6577cefa2efdbbee5c4 so you may go to hell, all of you, for there’s some mystery, some secret about it, and i don’t intend to worry my brains over your secrets.
0x47ea51252185d0fff722f67a48034c2f863a57d2 so i’ve simply come to swear at you,” he finished, getting up, “to relieve my mind.
0xd20faf32858737c1e83d3f24928caff8652d4a59 and i know what to do now.”
0xf7abd3eecc08cfe12c7632b768c45722dd3f70e5 “what do you mean to do now?”
0xd0722c29dada84335c700f6829ff92cb4ebcb14d “what business is it of yours what i mean to do?”
0xa975350bbbbb66e473be1c0555cff8c321e9045f “you are going in for a drinking bout.”
0xc6839cbf6200e40586e1f9501056dcf684ebfb35 “how... how did you know?”
0xd1259c4fa05bfbaef34dc40508d8928feeab0e35 “why, it’s pretty plain.”
0x59813f07c0193395b55e404cc93fa0a635043f7e razumihin paused for a minute.
0x2b8f50afa0f8d93bf73b6d65757bd2690f462340 “you always have been a very rational person and you’ve never been mad, never,” he observed suddenly with warmth.
0x75faefe04edb0bddf66ac368fc2d24579e4af48c “you’re right: i shall drink.
0x7cd42f9696b71b22476e4f6adb5fcb8aa68153a8 good-bye!”
0x6c571f498aef8c6c3507969801c13a11cfcdb7fb and he moved to go out.
0xaf8b9e6249e9fb85bcb2430f5deb76df25896fd7 “i was talking with my sister--the day before yesterday, i think it was--about you, razumihin.”
0x0c023afd8c6a148a022915da5a3fa3fc2094b17d “about me!
0x85c05e63a4421f8b67dbcab5d9846aea32619589 but... where can you have seen her the day before yesterday?”
0xad3ccee7a4e9b6af7b9675437658be1ffc8b08d0 razumihin stopped short and even turned a little pale.
0x748de1f12776509adcc9be2337619df85bbb691a one could see that his heart was throbbing slowly and violently.
0xebaa724d99bd93e1379d910147dec44e2898ef08 “she came here by herself, sat there and talked to me.”
0xfbb3230d19edbec94146f1c6d03e9cbdceb3f8c8 “she did!”
0xa00f66ccca0a0d5e24a747fa3544a07776ae36a4 “yes.”
0x24f58844f9ff9637a28c3a912d8a6cf7e401bc2c “what did you say to her... i mean, about me?”
0xa72d27f74f2f36e95b176ec4f2f1eba138124a09 “i told her you were a very good, honest, and industrious man.
0xeb338c02a906568f1049470c5a266634af3a4bf3 i didn’t tell her you love her, because she knows that herself.”
0x5f2df98ea1f9e6ceb4e78e7b2cee0d3487311d02 “she knows that herself?”
0xb373357d48e82b3a81f95578a0617b4f8be39d87 “well, it’s pretty plain.
0x5b37a2047c45e2df54b2bf4661a18fd1ffadb447 wherever i might go, whatever happened to me, you would remain to look after them.
0xe0f17e5739676ee6e0680f93d865f1e06b054305 i, so to speak, give them into your keeping, razumihin.
0x255cff844eb8fac2c684ce69621c64a62f499625 i say this because i know quite well how you love her, and am convinced of the purity of your heart.
0xf5d7f21b96bf142c624c6d329243086e433352f9 i know that she too may love you and perhaps does love you already.
0xabab3f1656a4d6959f5f1dcc741ecfd73c1b51ac now decide for yourself, as you know best, whether you need go in for a drinking bout or not.”
0x5b18c2045eac83b9f3e79bd5b085531f23dbd4dd “rodya!
0x30c2b19c5e45988036281a0731ffd9179d7c8875 you see... well.... ach, damn it!
0x7daa08c15dc82b07f1746268d4acd48c1986a834 but where do you mean to go?
0x8bb5841ced349feafcc18362eccf2ea8b148a508 of course, if it’s all a secret, never mind.... but i... i shall find out the secret... and i am sure that it must be some ridiculous nonsense and that you’ve made it all up.
0x959e894e773fc7832ff19219854777988088488d anyway you are a capital fellow, a capital fellow!...”
0x0893d4f62c3459692b68a1d3211af3c7ef3bfb46 “that was just what i wanted to add, only you interrupted, that that was a very good decision of yours not to find out these secrets.
0xcb6197032f7113073a1300ef28fa7002a72393f7 leave it to time, don’t worry about it.
0x979ad569e9a6f7e4c4a820e1ab71f07de72e2a18 you’ll know it all in time when it must be.
0xa24466d7cd10f5089390d39c056709feb74e4b73 yesterday a man said to me that what a man needs is fresh air, fresh air, fresh air.
0xef55e05c7d21716c3598b33d0f50886768e0f12f i mean to go to him directly to find out what he meant by that.”
0xeec6dbf5e541660dab6845ae55e637c23fbcdcb4 razumihin stood lost in thought and excitement, making a silent conclusion.
0x09b5ec8a1d199598501ab8aa5a85dea51ff2bcb8 “he’s a political conspirator!
0x6464f732148231a724e823b988b875ec6328311c he must be.
0x5ece2d640c8e5bd7a15a4f03cdd26c9bfc5bba3d and he’s on the eve of some desperate step, that’s certain.
0xb26c71d60f3855db6dcc23650661f906d54668a7 it can only be that!
0x1ee252d1fdd611df5b588d69bb3ac0ca50dd08f6 and... and dounia knows,” he thought suddenly.
0xe88a516db4d413ae5b8e6b2c15504134a3a381fc “so avdotya romanovna comes to see you,” he said, weighing each syllable, “and you’re going to see a man who says we need more air, and so of course that letter... that too must have something to do with it,” he concluded to himself.
0xe6b6db39e8e705c314315dbf14496a8231742a62 “what letter?”
0xf03c89fe9273c176aca3d72a99587b4349cdf2af “she got a letter to-day.
0x28239c35226b49eb1170e7708b0aff8bd22787ba it upset her very much--very much indeed.
0xb0e216bd3f5b6f7b99db1f0982ae7cc41e3f0e5f too much so.
0xc4bab4f1b2a42fd3d8d3633733ba6e6fa0272508 i began speaking of you, she begged me not to.
0xfd0301b5181ea1efa401fa661fc8345bc1ac52e3 then... then she said that perhaps we should very soon have to part... then she began warmly thanking me for something; then she went to her room and locked herself in.”
0x3fbe2eab8523c356bf41acd26b6318e41847c27b “she got a letter?”
0x720b9271fa1ae94d71e50f795bd90770239c942d raskolnikov asked thoughtfully.
0xc90dbfe18073da624b1348e35c99f80ebd30ad43 “yes, and you didn’t know?
0x77a9df993e04768c0b02eeef481ca6bf00fe04e5 hm...” they were both silent.
0x9d542aaa61d69e409cff80fb0413d66530814d2d “good-bye, rodion.
0xcd517d9ba691451b902116ac8fd1c85c2aadd62e there was a time, brother, when i.... never mind, good-bye.
0xbb29471989ee36e4d1f70b34be69e747b5c7e2a1 you see, there was a time.... well, good-bye!
0x8ab8fc2d466e5f24b748f166052dcbc20081185e i must be off too.
0x86cf3eaae6465c8b0f9645f0fac8cc340a5e72a3 i am not going to drink.
0x6f4333ca0610c4e874d73d861fd25800c89f0821 there’s no need now.... that’s all stuff!”
0xed3aa0fe199ca2e046e39677fce2b17549fed0f9 he hurried out; but when he had almost closed the door behind him, he suddenly opened it again, and said, looking away: “oh, by the way, do you remember that murder, you know porfiry’s, that old woman?
0x57aaf6d6a4714a8779f44b5ca745e7e276f5e622 do you know the murderer has been found, he has confessed and given the proofs.
0x623a15d30871ccaeed83a035b661cf4151c732eb it’s one of those very workmen, the painter, only fancy!
0xcf1dd7fb8121c5cc0ad4f37a9b9f4d940f5545a6 do you remember i defended them here?
0xf71e7f9994865f9b1fb4decd635e7d3195822926 would you believe it, all that scene of fighting and laughing with his companions on the stairs while the porter and the two witnesses were going up, he got up on purpose to disarm suspicion.
0x3ad86dfffb235e5efef7b28ceda00cbd58e898fb the cunning, the presence of mind of the young dog!
0xd24bd660b34bb978acdedc28587036319fd7c3b1 one can hardly credit it; but it’s his own explanation, he has confessed it all.
0x349a74bcac62cd57a7ac92aaa9f22892328cb0cf and what a fool i was about it!
0xb5e50361377387df891a90983034a4fc22dfb6ea well, he’s simply a genius of hypocrisy and resourcefulness in disarming the suspicions of the lawyers--so there’s nothing much to wonder at, i suppose!
0xaa56f078d62937abf67c9e5567a091b5abd35a86 of course people like that are always possible.
0x8c78045d1e00b799108cfa8bda20e9d52d8dc0db and the fact that he couldn’t keep up the character, but confessed, makes him easier to believe in.
0xc12a6a07d0a7af15fb5955177ac468535a7f4988 but what a fool i was!
0x8695bc316bd3a9194c02d6ab86b9ae760eae6abd i was frantic on their side!”
0x55b0191801ae5207baf7614157971782fbee17b8 “tell me, please, from whom did you hear that, and why does it interest you so?”
0x12add143df36977d70eb677f22121fa7aed2e44c raskolnikov asked with unmistakable agitation.
0xcdd2ef9dd62b087803ce7572809e68f30cf98d8c “what next?
0x8136c866765ba2160e402647114a3dfba65b8f4d you ask me why it interests me!... well, i heard it from porfiry, among others... it was from him i heard almost all about it.”
0x5869cadfdb45794a56c842421aaf3c99bc96a4d0 “from porfiry?”
0x93d2f1049178be2bcb227e038f3a6a5cc40407e1 “from porfiry.”
0x7d22270cf85fc43cae53af27e3ab72d3e7325c34 “what... what did he say?”
0xaf35a5256c53b91d145df6df546c84b2d2629e0b raskolnikov asked in dismay.
0x17c37e201691ce97fcf795e786380295ead7d663 “he gave me a capital explanation of it.
0x99e6dd0920c171e941d7c06fbe9a725cf2e80271 psychologically, after his fashion.”
0x890642279862d35a6d7351e702c5d1c571e69ab8 “he explained it?
0x1eb87e7795ba3aa4d5310cd7fd1ae4b94e75f951 explained it himself?”
0x0ff1db4bbe7539cb24ae6c5ebfa8a901dec9ef95 “yes, yes; good-bye.

0xd30df296521877b14bc4a8df05e9f9ab7c591ce3 he went out.
0xd17d4460c8f889c4a6edba93e364edfeefd0535e “he’s a political conspirator, there’s not a doubt about it,” razumihin decided, as he slowly descended the stairs.
0xc87d6976f66c2a9c265e7b382c78ab67b2cbef7a “and he’s drawn his sister in; that’s quite, quite in keeping with avdotya romanovna’s character.

0xcef720b14969c3b2fbc412336e8b7e2b69c712e6 it was his doing, under the lamp in the corridor that day.

0x47b1e78e3ef9c89a7a8057f3330e5a4ad04a49b8 he thought of dounia, realising all he had heard and his heart throbbed, and he suddenly broke into a run.
0x65311d3fe26342ea9948dd79fec845dc604281b1 as soon as razumihin went out, raskolnikov got up, turned to the window, walked into one corner and then into another, as though forgetting the smallness of his room, and sat down again on the sofa.
0xc274cb909854d98e74f536dae9820d4e373990c0 he felt, so to speak, renewed; again the struggle, so a means of escape had come.
0x87f5acf51f87e7a9b622497f513142cb4d807a9b “yes, a means of escape had come!
0x76fab5bfc020014fd0a0d44224b23f8f7fc63920 it had been too stifling, too cramping, the burden had been too agonising.
0x77033df7bae9978a7e185ef13411dbffc71794ae a lethargy had come upon him at times.
0xab9217ced03ac33cb1994b5c7a4bf2dc7b07a01f from the moment of the scene with nikolay at porfiry’s he had been suffocating, penned in without hope of escape.
0xe2117a7ff4d98b1307a0749c3e627edf6fec69eb after nikolay’s confession, on that very day had come the scene with sonia; his behaviour and his last words had been utterly unlike anything he could have imagined beforehand; he had grown feebler, instantly and fundamentally!
0x9e0088eba093181cfd1240e98456e2bbd544b1cf and he had agreed at the time with sonia, he had agreed in his heart he could not go on living alone with such a thing on his mind!
0x0d14c2f571a0bc040e7a0a49c8e0f1345f8f8f49 “and svidrigaïlov was a riddle... he worried him, that was true, but somehow not on the same point.
0x3d6c8a6395a09affe63b794f4705001098739cf8 he might still have a struggle to come with svidrigaïlov.
0xbcd57e36a53387c2c74103af5b3556af88f67bd8 svidrigaïlov, too, might be a means of escape; but porfiry was a different matter.
0x07a5c7f852e8fbb7b29b3748d654c35febdcac96 “and so porfiry himself had explained it to razumihin, had explained it _psychologically_.
0x75e7a7c883995248232b938da5ccb6c3e63a429e he had begun bringing in his damned psychology again!
0x58fbcb88b05b26e2a3c2209f6b643b324f4ee379 porfiry?
0xf1317c317f94bf117fcfa29d021fa030b323ef94 but to think that porfiry should for one moment believe that nikolay was guilty, after what had passed between them before nikolay’s appearance, after that tête-à-tête interview, which could have only _one_ explanation?
0xc1d2af3012bd4d2e2a609f48008e54365bf7be40 (during those days raskolnikov had often recalled passages in that scene with porfiry; he could not bear to let his mind rest on it.)
0x255520025fc5d4edd95cd67a493ff39ceec8872f such words, such gestures had passed between them, they had exchanged such glances, things had been said in such a tone and had reached such a pass, that nikolay, whom porfiry had seen through at the first word, at the first gesture, could not have shaken his conviction.
0x549650fa7289eae2fa1b649a84dd787e0b846608 “and to think that even razumihin had begun to suspect!
0x4f10de516b8f784069fc55b118cd848ba9e461ac the scene in the corridor under the lamp had produced its effect then.
0x1a19f0813f53a222c55de93450727c27a24aa093 he had rushed to porfiry.... but what had induced the latter to receive him like that?
0xaf0ae68ec79b1635feea72a17af308ecbdd542b0 what had been his object in putting razumihin off with nikolay?
0x55da7b9629435cd535676f445995e5915c431751 he must have some plan; there was some design, but what was it?
0xaffe8b51521a292a740b45d267b9dfccadd17fcb it was true that a long time had passed since that morning--too long a time--and no sight nor sound of porfiry.
0xfddac3586c298ab1975da5114b438fd861af3319 well, that was a bad sign....” raskolnikov took his cap and went out of the room, still pondering.
0xd315af5d4fe30bad905d558a94101bdf812a56bd it was the first time for a long while that he had felt clear in his mind, at least.
0x98610259c2fdbc6c2b0b87b069fde0926bd0b5e6 “i must settle svidrigaïlov,” he thought, “and as soon as possible; he, too, seems to be waiting for me to come to him of my own accord.”
0xf8c7aa3ea130d45e20980c7b4fa4fac540a3da33 and at that moment there was such a rush of hate in his weary heart that he might have killed either of those two--porfiry or svidrigaïlov.
0x0d2492a97a3eeeb3949f7bf8edf641f0815d1b56 at least he felt that he would be capable of doing it later, if not now.
0x3324825dd1a19f2f75db47cc0defa0cff94c2d66 “we shall see, we shall see,” he repeated to himself.
0xfe81579d727b3d81561b0d65a42add0c93a4e023 but no sooner had he opened the door than he stumbled upon porfiry himself in the passage.
0x2df2ff8bd13781e9e1320bfacad4ab2421686d00 he was coming in to see him.
0x51ff7d3b5c88772bd8e7430c1fffa4cd962f6223 raskolnikov was dumbfounded for a minute, but only for one minute.
0x3143e79dd840908717a5745d990fe716f0c88d0d strange to say, he was not very much astonished at seeing porfiry and scarcely afraid of him.
0x251f64316a35d798bcd5bd4b17ed37fa4f2c90d0 he was simply startled, but was quickly, instantly, on his guard.
0x8b32fcc4eb17f4755e2debdcdec854c238f99a3c “perhaps this will mean the end?
0x93f2ae3eabf2662143ce38957a21fa933b5a48fb but how could porfiry have approached so quietly, like a cat, so that he had heard nothing?
0x0fa8aca373a97707aeef6eb035901116332df434 could he have been listening at the door?”
0xf8f771fb770d8eecad89fa0cf385380bc7ac388b “you didn’t expect a visitor, rodion romanovitch,” porfiry explained, laughing.
0x05b8944d3ad6a4dd5bc357efb5495be783b2ac8d “i’ve been meaning to look in a long time; i was passing by and thought why not go in for five minutes.
0xd9a8fb4e1ca9de52ef40360f99d3afd0f8e009d0 are you going out?
0x12adeb87d7959ffc83b4a00aba9e86f45d6d3b38 i won’t keep you long.
0x7734ee31a8935852823146c30a0e73758f5865b2 just let me have one cigarette.”
0xd06cea319aeefa604c89dde1005c89e472360c1c “sit down, porfiry petrovitch, sit down.”
0xa53b5d2c97e44d4475e338e4b6dfa3aeb8ba01fc raskolnikov gave his visitor a seat with so pleased and friendly an expression that he would have marvelled at himself, if he could have seen it.
0x4396eba90db1732ae93c7172fc9f54c3f5fb80ce the last moment had come, the last drops had to be drained!
0x4d160df922c3b0d2ff62844fc1b0a8dafff6f3ea so a man will sometimes go through half an hour of mortal terror with a brigand, yet when the knife is at his throat at last, he feels no fear.
0x10c52a02f16903681c1b9904c364973e0c2dd0b0 raskolnikov seated himself directly facing porfiry, and looked at him without flinching.
0x52961788de83e26222bd991f35e8525585a59e95 porfiry screwed up his eyes and began lighting a cigarette.
0xb11b1c6a515584c1c5b3259256cc1cd1b59b0606 “speak, speak,” seemed as though it would burst from raskolnikov’s heart.
0x976a7fe4ee3cec243bc9bb1f8a66f712651d4150 “come, why don’t you speak?”
0x6fd7e20d5b805a1d0bd30fcdd9a3130b9be15554 chapter ii “ah these cigarettes!”
0xe2b7795b221941388dc357d2ad6bfb68a337a4e3 porfiry petrovitch ejaculated at last, having lighted one.
0x7e08719dc018a0ae83274fe86c74c2d54c34982e “they are pernicious, positively pernicious, and yet i can’t give them up!
0xd923701bb0f62790919c9d3b2d36a57e1af8f01b i cough, i begin to have tickling in my throat and a difficulty in breathing.

0x695a7f63d0fed7e947a10c74cd8d3bb06b0c335d he positively laughed looking at me; he sounded me: ‘tobacco’s bad for you,’ he said, ‘your lungs are affected.’
0xf3aba2ef9c7cb3a58c0adcd2f8f60f577a096e33 but how am i to give it up?
0x8f35f4c6b9fafb6c14d413e3cf22ce63169e2c14 what is there to take its place?

0x73dda7d311fc96312a993baef7bdbe7a33fe2f89 everything is relative, rodion romanovitch, everything is relative!”
0x1f0bddcca76a13fc75214d66dbfba07bf46d740b “why, he’s playing his professional tricks again,” raskolnikov thought with disgust.
0x2488852208f10b0414898a417b00f0783dd6c7c1 all the circumstances of their last interview suddenly came back to him, and he felt a rush of the feeling that had come upon him then.
0xa651ae2d19cc8f60da5cbcac51945125225bfddd “i came to see you the day before yesterday, in the evening; you didn’t know?”
0xfaac48f5063a79836ffff138063a6e88e14e336a porfiry petrovitch went on, looking round the room.
0x1691c295477e7b7487fd03e541fe825d999fc579 “i came into this very room.
0xcba326f0edba4d254045ad9248bfabc1bf2321c3 i was passing by, just as i did to-day, and i thought i’d return your call.
0xae520284eb7048c4caf9a8415e42ad49aa3e588e i walked in as your door was wide open, i looked round, waited and went out without leaving my name with your servant.
0xa39503bf4cbafcd8a5700c827c6d904a7addfce8 don’t you lock your door?”
0x7bbabb026552897444ad7e1fe2377489a9cd25ba raskolnikov’s face grew more and more gloomy.
0xd51324ddd8298169c8e243aeee72e849837564b8 porfiry seemed to guess his state of mind.
0xc06e7812e9f856d79fea8e506bd5414fb096f64e “i’ve come to have it out with you, rodion romanovitch, my dear fellow!
0x3daf57457b042cbdee44520046cbabdbdf8d1b7c i owe you an explanation and must give it to you,” he continued with a slight smile, just patting raskolnikov’s knee.
0x2b885c2cb9af18cd0b0483334c4744c560b367c3 but almost at the same instant a serious and careworn look came into his face; to his surprise raskolnikov saw a touch of sadness in it.
0xf933013c71f2570aa73d30b343441e63b658a442 he had never seen and never suspected such an expression in his face.
0x1c5f2ce5b69209fce9b642e09b999299b622d6a4 “a strange scene passed between us last time we met, rodion romanovitch.
0xc9f595950b9dd00eea7a7ff3667f9db8e78e291b our first interview, too, was a strange one; but then... and one thing after another!
0xd36c99cd6ba7869e514a45fa584b9354a3ed58ae this is the point: i have perhaps acted unfairly to you; i feel it.
0x45e99051bd434342e1d71f1f4709ecf09121d9b4 do you remember how we parted?
0x0af510349815c661d47e7409f974f3fb540b2967 your nerves were unhinged and your knees were shaking and so were mine.
0xf46d4b5f83533e6791e9fb4474f48ab8e50d9d52 and, you know, our behaviour was unseemly, even ungentlemanly.
0x54ead06ceae87022c2dce016f31ec35a1d905d5e and yet we are gentlemen, above all, in any case, gentlemen; that must be understood.
0xbe4939bab13964f4773971d6c7c1abd817e714c6 do you remember what we came to?... and it was quite indecorous.”
0xfe2e63ca26baca568251c25ebae9e3290ea0fd8f “what is he up to, what does he take me for?”
0x06e87038a9f5c5abfcf66d7308fbb6c87ee3226f raskolnikov asked himself in amazement, raising his head and looking with open eyes on porfiry.
0xff61d1175393cb161c8a896f40555eeeecb03ac7 “i’ve decided openness is better between us,” porfiry petrovitch went on, turning his head away and dropping his eyes, as though unwilling to disconcert his former victim and as though disdaining his former wiles.
0x3d86008453792fa35d5baee23e7f8eaa3f31a292 “yes, such suspicions and such scenes cannot continue for long.
0x02ec3a6529b2223db1b9f4d781c49276d5bea389 nikolay put a stop to it, or i don’t know what we might not have come to.
0x8470be15aceaec1d7cb27072d661b0026a762f1a that damned workman was sitting at the time in the next room--can you realise that?
0x41bc5ca4fdaf8eec2bcfed381fbd4400fcfb9d22 you know that, of course; and i am aware that he came to you afterwards.
0xc5ca3d278b7fa9330cd8515707cb360561083a46 but what you supposed then was not true: i had not sent for anyone, i had made no kind of arrangements.
0x6efab1535fde178f6bd6507659328c18f51eb122 you ask why i hadn’t?
0x171e55d24680e42fd2b736d78003ba97a1a2e794 what shall i say to you?
0x44cce207bb1996a150c8d191d0236853c77ce37a it had all come upon me so suddenly.
0xe29607d6d26bf6ea4e846b4f411309a3f7bf7592 i had scarcely sent for the porters (you noticed them as you went out, i dare say).
0x313ed87c526bc0939036c09b6e5cc6676a33c707 an idea flashed upon me; i was firmly convinced at the time, you see, rodion romanovitch.
0xdff0defeedd3c6f800f880f9ffef71a0b29d4ade come, i thought--even if i let one thing slip for a time, i shall get hold of something else--i shan’t lose what i want, anyway.
0x77faafcbdd63a92728d9ba1e467f822961cab3f9 you are nervously irritable, rodion romanovitch, by temperament; it’s out of proportion with other qualities of your heart and character, which i flatter myself i have to some extent divined.
0x59fc727527122c180f738e013a55d492270de6db of course i did reflect even then that it does not always happen that a man gets up and blurts out his whole story.
0x09a00e8fa0c0191d50b5133f865cea33fe6100ac it does happen sometimes, if you make a man lose all patience, though even then it’s rare.
0xfe37f331656ee342f7d40e2131dd35bfad4359d5 i was capable of realising that.
0xb1aaabb02c3980ecf808ef759d2dd77f3c43eb54 if i only had a fact, i thought, the least little fact to go upon, something i could lay hold of, something tangible, not merely psychological.
0x0460baddbfafb97d5f640df660831d24c6223df9 for if a man is guilty, you must be able to get something substantial out of him; one may reckon upon most surprising results indeed.
0x17261c2c3b9036e0bff5ed4481023f1bfb2e23df i was reckoning on your temperament, rodion romanovitch, on your temperament above all things!
0x387985e5cc7ccc37ad3a0689d8a09b3705b4178c i had great hopes of you at that time.”
0x4b122cf848794a1a7db8907455b35cdf8c95a86d “but what are you driving at now?”
0xeac1bfc1a4ddd662cd5937745873a70d67912ea9 raskolnikov muttered at last, asking the question without thinking.
0x99d7634c5f6e0751d8750e0b990e93bca919b9e4 “what is he talking about?”
0x973d47a4be3bb84f99db579692ef1dba0083ffd3 he wondered distractedly, “does he really take me to be innocent?”

0x96f105e01845e7c2879e8e654c2fe60451af2124 porfiry petrovitch made a dignified pause.
0xc8756a87999e1660937c81ce338d8ea035f264e2 raskolnikov felt a rush of renewed alarm.
0x2b8cb523e44b9aeedeced943fa6b15c0ca8eae38 the thought that porfiry believed him to be innocent began to make him uneasy.
0xc0b09625ee9345cbc3cbab98e1769e0cc6b54416 “it’s scarcely necessary to go over everything in detail,” porfiry petrovitch went on.
0x2c4ca2457828e4f7ba1a1e2137c5c4900bff324e “indeed, i could scarcely attempt it.

0xe262a2c2fc26d5d5cc5f3bb7d0ca638c019d1790 those rumours and that accident led to one idea in my mind.

0xcb7c71eac20326d4160e732f199a702b78cc8aa8 it was just one thing after another, rodion romanovitch, my dear fellow!
0x17180549275110429ef23483a9bef7f76e37720c how could i avoid being brought to certain ideas?
0x04fd0bdf4d6d35ac678e1be1f16d796ea3756ea2 from a hundred rabbits you can’t make a horse, a hundred suspicions don’t make a proof, as the english proverb says, but that’s only from the rational point of view--you can’t help being partial, for after all a lawyer is only human.
0xcbc4c61abf3cd46a9a15e9d1c785bb0e5eb89d5d i thought, too, of your article in that journal, do you remember, on your first visit we talked of it?
0x075ae7cfa7398a63b896ee2cb79606f3b0fa20a9 i jeered at you at the time, but that was only to lead you on.
0x12cf84d1326633632d5d1987f98d870fd454eb8f i repeat, rodion romanovitch, you are ill and impatient.
0x33e880028649670c646fc93db5f65458b03e9800 that you were bold, headstrong, in earnest and... had felt a great deal i recognised long before.
0x1a4078dc814332b517f97177dd319466b453de7c i, too, have felt the same, so that your article seemed familiar to me.
0x0fd807180de8c277842e66bb76e6db4a2ab04876 it was conceived on sleepless nights, with a throbbing heart, in ecstasy and suppressed enthusiasm.
0x1d2de63bb63d1fb0a77a855a94e2974c8a59fc3f and that proud suppressed enthusiasm in young people is dangerous!
0x6c4fd67935c2276acd93e3139c025bc1ba1c9552 i jeered at you then, but let me tell you that, as a literary amateur, i am awfully fond of such first essays, full of the heat of youth.
0x04fe1d5030b996cc7652d073a99f7b1f4c576398 there is a mistiness and a chord vibrating in the mist.
0x9de51e4fc2b4061e73867462ed8c765bd78c1b6c your article is absurd and fantastic, but there’s a transparent sincerity, a youthful incorruptible pride and the daring of despair in it.
0x317a9ef2f333a036bfd59b4d0a15f337766fdaa2 it’s a gloomy article, but that’s what’s fine in it.
0x22346f386281c2df9b065a84a400f49a9ca0951b i read your article and put it aside, thinking as i did so ‘that man won’t go the common way.’
0x183b47d3f95fe42571564c2fe01ddadd5313a8e6 well, i ask you, after that as a preliminary, how could i help being carried away by what followed?
0x471a3ca16ae88e7ae7bea7a0971e43aff172bfde oh, dear, i am not saying anything, i am not making any statement now.
0xd05d0d56dfc78cfc2a87bc9dc20016d677340f80 i simply noted it at the time.
0x6eb383b1d8697280cc45e103afd2d36a075364d1 what is there in it?
0x885efc1f6d07eb08943a2ff9ee96a6703ed5824e i reflected.
0x49b2225b95275e968ec4a819ba06d036d10bd403 there’s nothing in it, that is really nothing and perhaps absolutely nothing.
0x7529b8800edc1301583e1b69716585ea45615d34 and it’s not at all the thing for the prosecutor to let himself be carried away by notions: here i have nikolay on my hands with actual evidence against him--you may think what you like of it, but it’s evidence.
0x8edf0e7595d4f59edb9782a3a3751539651d4ba4 he brings in his psychology, too; one has to consider him, too, for it’s a matter of life and death.
0x59313be8348bb4fb53c6f17580adc3b9e8a0fa9f why am i explaining this to you?
0xecbbe507629f4f1072d9365b94bb73dc225bc02f that you may understand, and not blame my malicious behaviour on that occasion.
0x1177e0dfb34555777ec9930aa4b736f521043073 it was not malicious, i assure you, he-he!
0xe713e3ea05a6af30ea47d8cc2eefae25d986283b do you suppose i didn’t come to search your room at the time?
0xe243e9057a5742a109eea2f7bcb54aa7c3ddc188 i did, i did, he-he!
0x8f3f55ece8100368b96c1d0eaa51ffa6aaf12724 i was here when you were lying ill in bed, not officially, not in my own person, but i was here.
0x8a37e974cdeea10dff60709b0f6c861197802d44 your room was searched to the last thread at the first suspicion; but _umsonst_!
0xc0c2a7357a01fc681877aaf309a01cc5666741bf i thought to myself, now that man will come, will come of himself and quickly, too; if he’s guilty, he’s sure to come.
0xbcee3dcede30df8e3a14e3a21324a0f631eaa19d another man wouldn’t, but he will.
0x6274805ac5a8d24f80d092edfc43b20f87137f1c and you remember how mr. razumihin began discussing the subject with you?
0x5ad831512e87614984a4930c5dd6143f87cd316f we arranged that to excite you, so we purposely spread rumours, that he might discuss the case with you, and razumihin is not a man to restrain his indignation.
0x41445226bd1a4a230edd52dfcdabdd5981cfc196 mr. zametov was tremendously struck by your anger and your open daring.
0xcdd1d1398e695281c294dadfed10d7bc06b70a53 think of blurting out in a restaurant ‘i killed her.’
0x7683c430b27b51c7d3df13540c40b58fe37004dc it was too daring, too reckless.
0xd1f1cbdf780af1142e938d60569fa3fb1383e3d6 i thought so myself, if he is guilty he will be a formidable opponent.
0x6406d1b6785d0fdc2e9804789eba7562de867480 that was what i thought at the time.
0xe2999f215802ad5c83edc6cc9b694f71d6e53089 i was expecting you.
0x85b4d4d6201c794e5b0822811816e98cd4abd02a but you simply bowled zametov over and... well, you see, it all lies in this--that this damnable psychology can be taken two ways!
0xa19e252ba5fc3393991993970a900fd14381e049 well, i kept expecting you, and so it was, you came!
0xfbdea55d09f206df6245d9748b2fe9a6027c5b5a my heart was fairly throbbing.
0xc39550965f80f8a2b30a04169584387cfced91ce ach!
0x1c8e83a7bc463c31a64d050f85f3bfce78330805 “now, why need you have come?
0xde42980ace7f6ffba8c43b5f8beef2b6d3a35623 your laughter, too, as you came in, do you remember?
0x8570ded7e22c3c5d227d4719ecf72334adc75d37 i saw it all plain as daylight, but if i hadn’t expected you so specially, i should not have noticed anything in your laughter.
0xd3a86fe2ef413bc155cb2caaac83425625e87ad1 you see what influence a mood has!
0xb3627dac64f413c996339039d8dc634bf676d90f mr. razumihin then--ah, that stone, that stone under which the things were hidden!
0x769aaec25467b7a208c85cbe45a59a469fa9936a i seem to see it somewhere in a kitchen garden.
0x275172d437b966f3a31a74494ae3b967a4f97fa8 it was in a kitchen garden, you told zametov and afterwards you repeated that in my office?
0x058c774b70940ccb0ffc73fe58de8131d7c32175 and when we began picking your article to pieces, how you explained it!
0xc5109716c7de479113fa47831b80cbe414adc801 one could take every word of yours in two senses, as though there were another meaning hidden.
0xa98589019a16e2f6500e373e8ade776431d30e6a “so in this way, rodion romanovitch, i reached the furthest limit, and knocking my head against a post, i pulled myself up, asking myself what i was about.
0x4f1ca1756045bfcb25e3b2f5ba9bc3f1516ef755 after all, i said, you can take it all in another sense if you like, and it’s more natural so, indeed.
0x2ad7a3876f99fca1ff859c254322009aa70c0625 i couldn’t help admitting it was more natural.
0x1c89af3baf3e76a4bc0ae9411b0445ba5a118456 i was bothered!
0xe1d47e3c69b88ec49e60607aa7f279a80327cbc8 ‘no, i’d better get hold of some little fact’ i said.
0x57075b137fa69b5cc32d47c4db83265adc5cfa25 so when i heard of the bell-ringing, i held my breath and was all in a tremor.
0x6bbbf7b96e7f6342d32b8a15f95e2a337a7b76a2 ‘here is my little fact,’ thought i, and i didn’t think it over, i simply wouldn’t.
0xfa65895f2f36dd2cea4f9b66a354ad4262f07810 i would have given a thousand roubles at that minute to have seen you with my own eyes, when you walked a hundred paces beside that workman, after he had called you murderer to your face, and you did not dare to ask him a question all the way.
0xa5ed135f73d2ff9b107efeaeb308764394666cdc and then what about your trembling, what about your bell-ringing in your illness, in semi-delirium?
0x3397b4afad1bf9562084ad5ee6f8820500e31e19 “and so, rodion romanovitch, can you wonder that i played such pranks on you?
0x1840d97c7a08f2ccbab5ccc34af1399d55b41292 and what made you come at that very minute?
0x739b73773b26f57a1e9bea3be2a8456b7eb9de24 someone seemed to have sent you, by jove!
0x3e11c0dbe8e737e5ba15ec510d246412b5a24d90 and if nikolay had not parted us... and do you remember nikolay at the time?
0x0395b6d8eea0d7afcad4e6275914e6f9ae34b8df do you remember him clearly?
0x7ba3a0e8d0bcfa6c75a684b1af4f7245bc1a0bcc it was a thunderbolt, a regular thunderbolt!
0x1b557902ad0b264c2f6cdea1399582530d1e8af3 and how i met him!
0x564a27b7c7413d7eedccf3483f0dc109f41d5000 i didn’t believe in the thunderbolt, not for a minute.
0x4516a7c44a372dc49e979c19ad42b25302e05867 you could see it for yourself; and how could i?
0x85ec68e15fdc7cbbd2e1b44c119ef69d9a84d41a even afterwards, when you had gone and he began making very, very plausible answers on certain points, so that i was surprised at him myself, even then i didn’t believe his story!
0xb77cc66fe6bb426b380e44a1dcb528b76c83835f you see what it is to be as firm as a rock!
0x48dacbea5dbad433b1c1bcc82d34e81046f595e4 no, thought i, _morgenfrüh_.
0xb20bd1eb1beacb2dff7e92c4a4602dfc8bce7ba9 what has nikolay got to do with it!”
0xcda7c0d383bc8a532e4cd05ab288694f3e4cd3bf “razumihin told me just now that you think nikolay guilty and had yourself assured him of it....” his voice failed him, and he broke off.
0xd91b5272db89f4e838c381d3ba9a105e1661174f he had been listening in indescribable agitation, as this man who had seen through and through him, went back upon himself.
0xafba973c71cbbad6819bfa33e11c6d5e3dc8bece he was afraid of believing it and did not believe it.
0x6329189cae482750c730f519a2293772040fd66f in those still ambiguous words he kept eagerly looking for something more definite and conclusive.
0x1c974cc37c3073667f4fa629b56d03855186f111 “mr.
0x9f7696e32a194be0ae885cf8bd448a500b181e55 razumihin!”
0x48923ca8b1413036c606f91f197ec93227a1942c cried porfiry petrovitch, seeming glad of a question from raskolnikov, who had till then been silent.
0xcae35fdd72c8c4343ba04b75a4e17416ebacdd8d “he-he-he!
0x5232d5fd03441d12045272b0153de24117b867d5 but i had to put mr. razumihin off; two is company, three is none.
0x5c449b1656fbd64c1263bbf37ac7522ee6307c60 mr. razumihin is not the right man, besides he is an outsider.
0xc47a8ddced19407633efa4dad1199d2034a2a903 he came running to me with a pale face.... but never mind him, why bring him in?
0xca17cd0dab51c40af85dabcccc58542c2839e563 to return to nikolay, would you like to know what sort of a type he is, how i understand him, that is?
0x424b4d648d782bd2cc109bb95b2da870d8471a92 to begin with, he is still a child and not exactly a coward, but something by way of an artist.
0x5030b21bd83a27ec8f2fa517d4bef79c703aef12 really, don’t laugh at my describing him so.
0x2eae95d9ffdaaaaba37c3e029e8d55ba99970bad he is innocent and responsive to influence.
0x98ea2128cdd2f57d0d4cd8ab0dae65e997fdc908 he has a heart, and is a fantastic fellow.
0xf8f3824f35429fc3e7c1b4e749ddeacaf2c06dd8 he sings and dances, he tells stories, they say, so that people come from other villages to hear him.
0xab84a585c0fb3a1d8f20ec025114e144344d9fcb he attends school too, and laughs till he cries if you hold up a finger to him; he will drink himself senseless--not as a regular vice, but at times, when people treat him, like a child.
0x02e083e32d3e4df448bca89754ef7c149e6799ce and he stole, too, then, without knowing it himself, for ‘how can it be stealing, if one picks it up?’
0xacee77bd7a3df645e4de51364d914fd0add1f0a3 and do you know he is an old believer, or rather a dissenter?
0x88dd8c0e683d77e65d0bf4caed0cd95233b33259 there have been wanderers[*] in his family, and he was for two years in his village under the spiritual guidance of a certain elder.
0xf1982710fe17d6357ebf306d23a809a8b44d24fe i learnt all this from nikolay and from his fellow villagers.
0x94706f67a06d8091f404a2d472ab46dfc8facff7 and what’s more, he wanted to run into the wilderness!
0xbe7fd4dea009f0d44cad5af79d1f70d1d2d5d472 he was full of fervour, prayed at night, read the old books, ‘the true’ ones, and read himself crazy.
0xa804c99f9a1674daf0e1435fe78ee0586c3ec4c9 [*] a religious sect.--translator’s note.
0xa0ff8a2981ee62b7feb04bd44cc64a10bde54b1e “petersburg had a great effect upon him, especially the women and the wine.
0xdec01c46f05d504b476afe3fe3ba3a38ee7d1a6f he responds to everything and he forgot the elder and all that.
0xeeb459261ea6965baf4c72722b4eb03fb3b88cde i learnt that an artist here took a fancy to him, and used to go and see him, and now this business came upon him.
0xe8901a20807788061bf356eae816c33107c4fae7 “well, he was frightened, he tried to hang himself!
0x75bc30d9809767d8161e13982b199fba7c6d5249 he ran away!
0xed334685ceab9399f458b69a604bd85ab1e8a733 how can one get over the idea the people have of russian legal proceedings?
0xb36eb753b391d45804dc1bc712c40e35ecb9d24f the very word ‘trial’ frightens some of them.
0x4ad4535a4fc7e6ae281a169818ccc0a5d26ae35d whose fault is it?
0xbf3e99b720503ea354eb31cb970c436de25bf81b we shall see what the new juries will do.
0x6e8abffab4f192f570e32bb9a82b42871beae404 god grant they do good!
0xade33b551565d338ff5947e70dcbdaad7034fa81 well, in prison, it seems, he remembered the venerable elder; the bible, too, made its appearance again.
0xec28d6715ceef57e5400b742959085518e57016a do you know, rodion romanovitch, the force of the word ‘suffering’ among some of these people!
0xdbafe74617c6b6dc5d254f1475c5f2f540312c20 it’s not a question of suffering for someone’s benefit, but simply, ‘one must suffer.’
0x12cd4284aae454ab11846a0b6e1ea3d046dc687a if they suffer at the hands of the authorities, so much the better.
0xfa8a79949f730e4d150c8776e24356265b090204 in my time there was a very meek and mild prisoner who spent a whole year in prison always reading his bible on the stove at night and he read himself crazy, and so crazy, do you know, that one day, apropos of nothing, he seized a brick and flung it at the governor; though he had done him no harm.
0x9088419c7987bc4b962978f8cc0290dc4d9b5b5b and the way he threw it too: aimed it a yard on one side on purpose, for fear of hurting him.
0x2385137067bd73d794e67f8fd6711fd3d190e0b4 well, we know what happens to a prisoner who assaults an officer with a weapon.
0xf950ff7aa19ab1d38e8f2399664368c25aa5fcf6 so ‘he took his suffering.’
0xb7e262f8e2e20fbd32f56adf43bcdefa4201aded “so i suspect now that nikolay wants to take his suffering or something of the sort.
0x07975bbbc5a510f32cd4db63064eeda58c4e78b3 i know it for certain from facts, indeed.

0x34dfbb2dd08f1ad12502a43e8b590e35f808c5ac you think he’ll hold out?
0x49356da6631d1141f785074d4a902db9f74dbe94 wait a bit, he’ll take his words back.
0x5cda8ac600ebfb59eb771153898d183ccbc42c2b i am waiting from hour to hour for him to come and abjure his evidence.
0x1124d654e2822bd36aa21fd75fcea93b3bad91a6 i have come to like that nikolay and am studying him in detail.
0x178001b1690c57365780c5937e48ac3f9dee4ad5 and what do you think?

0xc4a7454b9ffd7a325ffa144608b5c4d3bf1557b2 he answered me very plausibly on some points, he obviously had collected some evidence and prepared himself cleverly.
0x659e9f05c832551546ce391ff6ffd7889eb654fd but on other points he is simply at sea, knows nothing and doesn’t even suspect that he doesn’t know!

0x1293d0822cc467f381f2c657aa6532706f184824 this is a fantastic, gloomy business, a modern case, an incident of to-day when the heart of man is troubled, when the phrase is quoted that blood ‘renews,’ when comfort is preached as the aim of life.
0x80285ff7e4e426dc71c41ea4f5861ae4f060229d here we have bookish dreams, a heart unhinged by theories.
0x26065c0416863f267385aa5c099579fa1f9c2555 here we see resolution in the first stage, but resolution of a special kind: he resolved to do it like jumping over a precipice or from a bell tower and his legs shook as he went to the crime.
0x510e841a49b6c2b8eaf47b28ef612b8711373d79 he forgot to shut the door after him, and murdered two people for a theory.
0x0174964c632caa0b331a6d47298300090734e442 he committed the murder and couldn’t take the money, and what he did manage to snatch up he hid under a stone.
0xd5a754875a3e3d032b9aa4b40cfe3d9eee92a71b it wasn’t enough for him to suffer agony behind the door while they battered at the door and rung the bell, no, he had to go to the empty lodging, half delirious, to recall the bell-ringing, he wanted to feel the cold shiver over again.... well, that we grant, was through illness, but consider this: he is a murderer, but looks upon himself as an honest man, despises others, poses as injured innocence.
0x547d7f262c881bb1d9589ce14b094b40ef333f85 no, that’s not the work of a nikolay, my dear rodion romanovitch!”
0xdb0a50abafdf4ca1970140e3b8e93dbdf8c2e311 all that had been said before had sounded so like a recantation that these words were too great a shock.
0x48a9aed1cabb4877fcebf1b9df90e8c09c7e7501 raskolnikov shuddered as though he had been stabbed.
0x7eafa71b241f977257361c547f0ccad14a964772 “then... who then... is the murderer?”
0x36ad8f3f8da756b9fc74515f5059aabfe708dd5d he asked in a breathless voice, unable to restrain himself.
0xc92496213775c3ad0e2ba2d24fa84c0763a02a26 porfiry petrovitch sank back in his chair, as though he were amazed at the question.
0x7939452562c0de52ddb8b96d7e41d29c5fb945f2 “who is the murderer?”
0x6239e9dba8f3c0a4cb0002326beca27c2566cdfe he repeated, as though unable to believe his ears.
0x2f868ad556f25df4c77e503701ad9f7debd02a18 “why, _you_, rodion romanovitch!
0x888498ddd9b1be05e33d885d47e637239842ee63 you are the murderer,” he added, almost in a whisper, in a voice of genuine conviction.
0x4dc50df374b93705a0ce338f1ab3fe2b288614f7 raskolnikov leapt from the sofa, stood up for a few seconds and sat down again without uttering a word.
0x09b42c29e9bc1b1145f9739a434f767bb4507690 his face twitched convulsively.
0x87512a7b58f05ff211f33cdb7d588b5012cb0569 “your lip is twitching just as it did before,” porfiry petrovitch observed almost sympathetically.
0x19bcca248dd4fcaa9c6dc08e9717fc3004b1a575 “you’ve been misunderstanding me, i think, rodion romanovitch,” he added after a brief pause, “that’s why you are so surprised.
0x17d9da006234049719f8e4bdf2c3d146fe8113ec i came on purpose to tell you everything and deal openly with you.”
0x3d424c2adcf944818c6f7ea0bab72d99c339f81f “it was not i murdered her,” raskolnikov whispered like a frightened child caught in the act.
0x488d324356f2db38485d71fc92d78a7dde92652b “no, it was you, you rodion romanovitch, and no one else,” porfiry whispered sternly, with conviction.
0x0a2bf4c699139b4b26f8f6449fe70afa8923fbda they were both silent and the silence lasted strangely long, about ten minutes.
0x3b4b2f94b3f014f6a385e154c7177e862a11c7b0 raskolnikov put his elbow on the table and passed his fingers through his hair.
0xc241beb0265d2b5e4efd57584dd5851f36faafc7 porfiry petrovitch sat quietly waiting.
0xaa444ea7d5285cd4469d25a91ab3289a529ce4d5 suddenly raskolnikov looked scornfully at porfiry.
0xc459d10258586f4f4d2d1e3b7d84583909732225 “you are at your old tricks again, porfiry petrovitch!
0xa510521b54cdad4fc4586393f39cef62d72e9d24 your old method again.
0x181baa0960322298284ef54767eb613af4b0f6fc i wonder you don’t get sick of it!”
0x2eb74d2aee68bc91f8466a5f4ed7db21f1347598 “oh, stop that, what does that matter now?
0x9c35a76268d6df5c9539689234af97485d870ad8 it would be a different matter if there were witnesses present, but we are whispering alone.
0x1bb941dbeaf3ed24c10b1cab277e320b429b0d32 you see yourself that i have not come to chase and capture you like a hare.
0x54dbc92184801f76d92b9cb0e974eb1db33a4d27 whether you confess it or not is nothing to me now; for myself, i am convinced without it.”
0x7fdacb387ea10a8f8c9041d584b054d2643c650e “if so, what did you come for?”
0x7068945c4641cb50117925134c4c516d011b51f6 raskolnikov asked irritably.
0xfb0d97ea1582d7040be158ec44cd7fa5ebfaebf2 “i ask you the same question again: if you consider me guilty, why don’t you take me to prison?”
0x38d11d65ee137b4b1180e02a6cab72ad31c792e1 “oh, that’s your question!
0x330b0aff6185c0d4ffd51316a6a57b2ae443224a i will answer you, point for point.
0x5e87d6369f65201cbc75c9d4e0e25d966aadbbbf in the first place, to arrest you so directly is not to my interest.”
0x8a534f362d3665834411ae026aa203a810427a61 “how so?
0xa1e5dbccbfe2caf133c4194a0cd63a6bd789760c if you are convinced you ought....” “ach, what if i am convinced?
0x801d73a256146799841343ff7a42ddcb31cc7af4 that’s only my dream for the time.
0xb4e27b9a232d529b7b7d412b575602784e51ef16 why should i put you in safety?
0x71089ebd339660702bb94320bf697490dfe1418b you know that’s it, since you ask me to do it.
0x463eb442f4edb3077c9bec024800577f630fed6f if i confront you with that workman for instance and you say to him ‘were you drunk or not?
0x16fa2dc122a2cf8d867242ccab7d9d9582d2bc6c who saw me with you?
0xb564a06ec779b1cdadab670dd89f1f54939f6e3b i simply took you to be drunk, and you were drunk, too.’
0x8b0a052c1bd33947a925b3fa76c05704dedb4dfc well, what could i answer, especially as your story is a more likely one than his?
0xc02a8755c56e1ca715762887fe07508e2f40eabc for there’s nothing but psychology to support his evidence--that’s almost unseemly with his ugly mug, while you hit the mark exactly, for the rascal is an inveterate drunkard and notoriously so.
0x68e6c99b4174c31bc5e752ffa880476489866405 and i have myself admitted candidly several times already that that psychology can be taken in two ways and that the second way is stronger and looks far more probable, and that apart from that i have as yet nothing against you.
0x5fd27dccd62d158d74d0c8b703de3b26d15f9249 and though i shall put you in prison and indeed have come--quite contrary to etiquette--to inform you of it beforehand, yet i tell you frankly, also contrary to etiquette, that it won’t be to my advantage.
0xe4465054fce341ee2c589f68827baae10bb14e76 well, secondly, i’ve come to you because...” “yes, yes, secondly?”
0xc351dacc6d91089e78f7a8128743258bdc78f23d raskolnikov was listening breathless.
0x59677a42097bc0a3a7c14ef99df5fe21a1a5a5be “because, as i told you just now, i consider i owe you an explanation.
0x564e93d154e3f69bc9cdb9e8d2ff08ce51efdfb2 i don’t want you to look upon me as a monster, as i have a genuine liking for you, you may believe me or not.
0x61fb3dc6d244f76f38764b4b599b05322395d361 and in the third place i’ve come to you with a direct and open proposition--that you should surrender and confess.
0xf2863d4a4427b7cea8088ca0a6bd03ac8a3ee315 it will be infinitely more to your advantage and to my advantage too, for my task will be done.
0x429b02c83a6f94809e9ad62f95897230872c37e4 well, is this open on my part or not?”
0x3001b50b44fb638063228cd7d83f65c708308146 raskolnikov thought a minute.
0x38259c723ad331f5e00a7abb9997135936cf29ce “listen, porfiry petrovitch.
0x53dab1479ed950b834749868afc0303b6a3f81c2 you said just now you have nothing but psychology to go on, yet now you’ve gone on mathematics.
0x007b64474f2a5daf8a37ce70d27ed5ee0580d2c6 well, what if you are mistaken yourself, now?”
0xb8fbd24e4d88a4876ff7255073f99d4a92440e34 “no, rodion romanovitch, i am not mistaken.
0x99a09d471f760b33c3311efe37561386f4faa566 i have a little fact even then, providence sent it me.”
0x34aff579803c0f01c3359abe6668c96da9c06319 “what little fact?”
0x948c9bbf68ad27d7479526cc14238690edff7317 “i won’t tell you what, rodion romanovitch.
0x068341e067f1f6cbdca9142ef1aa005b3583a451 and in any case, i haven’t the right to put it off any longer, i must arrest you.
0x90eca4fcad598bb8833187f807b5f7a7f2c2e2fc so think it over: it makes no difference to me _now_ and so i speak only for your sake.
0xdf6a6559a42d1f601a8e5e58f762a2a5fa885ece believe me, it will be better, rodion romanovitch.”
0x445cb5587d2ac9be91c55ad9f61aa68fe769bb28 raskolnikov smiled malignantly.
0x8c861016aff8260280af1b8772c90f7c3801aa09 “that’s not simply ridiculous, it’s positively shameless.
0x40d401830fc2fcfb28e3643a3ff6089596057040 why, even if i were guilty, which i don’t admit, what reason should i have to confess, when you tell me yourself that i shall be in greater safety in prison?”
0x224cb9f16ff732f145d9de80880985e77a5a6af2 “ah, rodion romanovitch, don’t put too much faith in words, perhaps prison will not be altogether a restful place.
0xc13903c155d24831eedb78035887f522f639ba15 that’s only theory and my theory, and what authority am i for you?
0x8bb20d96c222afafb7260a9d5bf43d67387e091c perhaps, too, even now i am hiding something from you?
0x65982a1c534d86e3946b6869b6963b29b32715c2 i can’t lay bare everything, he-he!
0x2ff48696a85e669eee6bcfa793d3aa8241af4b80 and how can you ask what advantage?
0xbafefc90447e7e4c2b38bdef257422e2216414aa don’t you know how it would lessen your sentence?
0x8d4b5c468f8fa135af802d440e25974b48d83d41 you would be confessing at a moment when another man has taken the crime on himself and so has muddled the whole case.
0x369d1f6671bffe39658454bbf3131f604b8694df consider that!
0xd7d5574afd836cc0553be8ba33049f8a423228f6 i swear before god that i will so arrange that your confession shall come as a complete surprise.
0x34446d40a5d2b58d9ea86968059383b8e6985aec we will make a clean sweep of all these psychological points, of a suspicion against you, so that your crime will appear to have been something like an aberration, for in truth it was an aberration.
0xaf343064a54d6f4071d60d736db8144de3aed7e1 i am an honest man, rodion romanovitch, and will keep my word.”
0x4f59c9b7928dbc579661bbd4612bdf16501ccd21 raskolnikov maintained a mournful silence and let his head sink dejectedly.
0xddec40cffc1507fd6380d2e7e3e2722916e2c034 he pondered a long while and at last smiled again, but his smile was sad and gentle.
0x32ce54f56b31b99cecad1f8c6aef54fb2300a200 “no!”
0xa888ad424bf8d947e1e4f857eefc372b8fbcbc04 he said, apparently abandoning all attempt to keep up appearances with porfiry, “it’s not worth it, i don’t care about lessening the sentence!”
0x788829c9b053fa65df0ecb28f5740658fd67d4ad “that’s just what i was afraid of!”
0xa74411e4a2bb614a4c107f18680394cae4fbe7e2 porfiry cried warmly and, as it seemed, involuntarily.
0x225a5a6ead34039099582577cefb5e8df342aae6 “that’s just what i feared, that you wouldn’t care about the mitigation of sentence.”
0xe9f03afdd376b59567f0aba0bc6128acceaed6b9 raskolnikov looked sadly and expressively at him.
0x1ffe4347c563727059d5fb92ef31d52f7708fbd6 “ah, don’t disdain life!”
0x60fe628f233e5699c33819a10b5846699fd94b44 porfiry went on.
0xd5f964abc7c6e8d8d9c946a311cfa25aad35a1f0 “you have a great deal of it still before you.
0xe3020b87801a02b702b4e5b3cacaced805ab7b4f how can you say you don’t want a mitigation of sentence?
0x26e979316e80d0067ed65017afa0e50a9a7f1b3a you are an impatient fellow!”
0xbebbd3e94b6b2f07a4c01c6eb04ac1aaf3bc2dd2 “a great deal of what lies before me?”
0x7e1bbe0a2365d4074d31098670443836ed342070 “of life.

0xed4944ef07b009acf14f3adaec4bd1706ff67c58 and it’s not for ever, the bondage....” “the time will be shortened,” laughed raskolnikov.
0xba7654b212978b5c554e933155f532bd3cdf0b2b “why, is it the bourgeois disgrace you are afraid of?
0x2ff1c450672d147f0bcdfb3e2925fa591d7223c1 it may be that you are afraid of it without knowing it, because you are young!
0x4ed98842798e7acaa1b9b42bdd7b3d2288ac9d1c but anyway _you_ shouldn’t be afraid of giving yourself up and confessing.”
0x4cb99cd6d58d05305426982e62311ba57e2dc4bf “ach, hang it!”
0x7fba234025f1aed8af6464ba91113eb476e83559 raskolnikov whispered with loathing and contempt, as though he did not want to speak aloud.
0x89824bc578b5a710e0cfb4860977a4c41a510bcb he got up again as though he meant to go away, but sat down again in evident despair.
0x36d7a2838eb18a864351583cc4bed94b3a994421 “hang it, if you like!
0x27f794f2eadcadba901cef02676a3344dfde0077 you’ve lost faith and you think that i am grossly flattering you; but how long has your life been?

0x59dbdca52b9e3758bb7c7e03066056688f7e1922 you made up a theory and then were ashamed that it broke down and turned out to be not at all original!
0xb20b1923c6ba35873c5f0ad0791a373ec8e678ad it turned out something base, that’s true, but you are not hopelessly base.
0x5609940122c95f42adaffa1510a5a7214bdaff71 by no means so base!
0x1d6b03258ab0a1dbb77476a9d25f905226ce038a at least you didn’t deceive yourself for long, you went straight to the furthest point at one bound.

0xe74fd6188f543d8f807dcb2ab7e72929c0d51c1c raskolnikov got up and took his cap.

0x0eb157791d6994e7cdbb40d383471275d75c9183 he, too, took his cap.
0xaf6095afe1cdf534887448c1b96be51af7a23aad “porfiry petrovitch, please don’t take up the notion that i have confessed to you to-day,” raskolnikov pronounced with sullen insistence.

0x8141bf1425837921f76a73dffe47abc4ecefd4fd if anything were to happen (though indeed i don’t believe in it and think you quite incapable of it), yet in case you were taken during these forty or fifty hours with the notion of putting an end to the business in some other way, in some fantastic fashion--laying hands on yourself--(it’s an absurd proposition, but you must forgive me for it) do leave a brief but precise note, only two lines, and mention the stone.

0xd3217607b9e502b92ee65dc156b3e99df52e634b porfiry went out, stooping and avoiding looking at raskolnikov.
0x43af7930951f518de2155623158ea2d3f35bb37a the latter went to the window and waited with irritable impatience till he calculated that porfiry had reached the street and moved away.
0xd76f8b8b51d15c9008949c2706e39fef0c376db8 then he too went hurriedly out of the room.
0x62e63003924a99b9fad4c5ecf2f20c7ba61ff5ce chapter iii he hurried to svidrigaïlov’s.
0x4ac4def7bb5de4fe82eebf2163a072eaf69aa702 what he had to hope from that man he did not know.
0x61ead0be80d951fc56f0a82e0fd5af29049fea76 but that man had some hidden power over him.
0x25e3f6151c420292aecf3c0a70cdcc779329219f having once recognised this, he could not rest, and now the time had come.
0x1c48ede27f5820b54f4074b20c2a04a2829b4df4 on the way, one question particularly worried him: had svidrigaïlov been to porfiry’s?
0xe458fe4b8801de36f2bbc5f49b5d89a14b0dae1d as far as he could judge, he would swear to it, that he had not.
0x5ab7b13719a09f243ed7e90df2ae228116c519c9 he pondered again and again, went over porfiry’s visit; no, he hadn’t been, of course he hadn’t.
0x8900cc033c6054a8298675d667174bd7334b0b62 but if he had not been yet, would he go?
0xb19d248d321576d13b1475ea5fd8c65d2b8ea041 meanwhile, for the present he fancied he couldn’t.
0xc1d2a529e188ba52f8833b3cc9e41eb29f30b41e why?
0xc468fdef2d5c4c3fa50b2722f47c927a3c45e002 he could not have explained, but if he could, he would not have wasted much thought over it at the moment.
0x82a9e6040cad21b82df613235a5196bf762bf540 it all worried him and at the same time he could not attend to it.
0x28601e780bf21dc6d9e2a50a9ecd4ceda813b1df strange to say, none would have believed it perhaps, but he only felt a faint vague anxiety about his immediate future.
0x6262dfec37fab1dff3ebbb0d966b0752aa94cbe0 another, much more important anxiety tormented him--it concerned himself, but in a different, more vital way.
0x05d5a847fcad39cde422602446b354cfd7315b21 moreover, he was conscious of immense moral fatigue, though his mind was working better that morning than it had done of late.
0xab12b77c076410b2968edd845395a53d636d5f30 and was it worth while, after all that had happened, to contend with these new trivial difficulties?
0x2f857d7bb412ebbec24b915bb1b832f972d09a11 was it worth while, for instance, to manoeuvre that svidrigaïlov should not go to porfiry’s?
0x7deaf152cc6d53bd190e1984109c3f81b61ff6ac was it worth while to investigate, to ascertain the facts, to waste time over anyone like svidrigaïlov?
0x17bb9bca2f847b2fda59c6d09bcc804806872498 oh, how sick he was of it all!
0x74a07bf27c3a8976110a534ecbb71da3c748a13b and yet he was hastening to svidrigaïlov; could he be expecting something _new_ from him, information, or means of escape?
0x873c50dab04c229ea7967759d0296106f88ef3ee men will catch at straws!
0x49a179d9949c2f8c78ecaa3cedc658dabbb4b6c9 was it destiny or some instinct bringing them together?
0xf18c470e908c6427e3594cca927ee39b7825f491 perhaps it was only fatigue, despair; perhaps it was not svidrigaïlov but some other whom he needed, and svidrigaïlov had simply presented himself by chance.
0x1d9217d8fcb68260067730f3510b401bb0a231ef sonia?
0x8b478eac39b09f6dfd3537006aad9472673de98d but what should he go to sonia for now?
0xf27188cf0399d57808f4b6191eaac1a998236524 to beg her tears again?
0xaadc4be2b562c0d2d02975b753c4689077770683 he was afraid of sonia, too.
0x4d1ddf1d48cd16031878893c6f5c63efc9e3d4f9 sonia stood before him as an irrevocable sentence.
0x7bd44f7448be61fa0b13acc936abba4980ef0556 he must go his own way or hers.
0x0e8c7fcec424c0d224aaf65791b837f71af0bb6c at that moment especially he did not feel equal to seeing her.
0x6e235b14a4cffeb481838398604c4a175f845e37 no, would it not be better to try svidrigaïlov?
0x1b227306f7ef455c8f2b30ef0225a960e69deb62 and he could not help inwardly owning that he had long felt that he must see him for some reason.
0x38e465e23581e1d264665c42907d8608cff5a29d but what could they have in common?
0x6ac927f92dc24c8496cf51e9c0c5f972661e0772 their very evil-doing could not be of the same kind.
0xe36d3c5500df404c8e898e5fa9beae890c0a284d the man, moreover, was very unpleasant, evidently depraved, undoubtedly cunning and deceitful, possibly malignant.
0xab4c5f65dce9fe2ba111115d1aa0776b89b3e5f0 such stories were told about him.
0x0f3a770748abfced52f5742126cc0068f59b9018 it is true he was befriending katerina ivanovna’s children, but who could tell with what motive and what it meant?
0x5e2590a6f04854f68d9c8b4ccc1b28a9b2e8d018 the man always had some design, some project.
0xe08e9bf28401cd53f9990cb8094ed65d0498b3ba there was another thought which had been continually hovering of late about raskolnikov’s mind, and causing him great uneasiness.
0xe55ffbee164c0268ab11fe48e6a182501aedecb9 it was so painful that he made distinct efforts to get rid of it.
0x433460ac8aa732b5fa5de5db6af16b719b1543aa he sometimes thought that svidrigaïlov was dogging his footsteps.
0x1f26b3fa7dfdb5a95f2e2b8e561fc1b85f48e840 svidrigaïlov had found out his secret and had had designs on dounia.
0x02193a9fe68d61bf8a68638d6b5e5e9468fe3089 what if he had them still?
0x7de7b61f106234d8a578c3f350aa2dfcc60614c2 wasn’t it practically certain that he had?
0x0b280bed7c2f25a981a4a05c0682531f2f041957 and what if, having learnt his secret and so having gained power over him, he were to use it as a weapon against dounia?
0x02cb01e4e98ee45a88bc4fa0ad3aa9c8b492b97b this idea sometimes even tormented his dreams, but it had never presented itself so vividly to him as on his way to svidrigaïlov.
0x2c8036c017fbf5f4198ca40cfb855438ed79ac02 the very thought moved him to gloomy rage.
0x0ebf9fe40c2053272a7eec8ea8a60202fef2af26 to begin with, this would transform everything, even his own position; he would have at once to confess his secret to dounia.
0x721e2edc7a74f1f9e470f99623ffe4e862a6794c would he have to give himself up perhaps to prevent dounia from taking some rash step?
0xa376d287176e19b55957f37c739ab265bdedb304 the letter?
0x0dde04eaa1e24e264eb7611c6a85640cff614ef4 this morning dounia had received a letter.
0x24f93d4069cd74b72f601c432e0b9ab8d52eda55 from whom could she get letters in petersburg?
0xbb442fa10eb18099cd95871e729ea9eb97f8c433 luzhin, perhaps?
0x1634e863c245c0a58f2765cd56055cb72ca0156f it’s true razumihin was there to protect her, but razumihin knew nothing of the position.
0x237ba9153abbaadeba188a42bf92147915a69ec2 perhaps it was his duty to tell razumihin?
0xe76db429a078cda78fb299ebc363f4323608687d he thought of it with repugnance.
0xbf9c15d59d66302276c25262e9e388cc4002cb02 in any case he must see svidrigaïlov as soon as possible, he decided finally.
0xc2c7a949614ee28b54ded51d2aebfeae2e8ebe10 thank god, the details of the interview were of little consequence, if only he could get at the root of the matter; but if svidrigaïlov were capable... if he were intriguing against dounia--then... raskolnikov was so exhausted by what he had passed through that month that he could only decide such questions in one way; “then i shall kill him,” he thought in cold despair.
0x0be712bfb87c34cffcf5f413afd1c5949d9fe569 a sudden anguish oppressed his heart, he stood still in the middle of the street and began looking about to see where he was and which way he was going.
0x20e2d6a95113055940d375c16f51f905577f1c5f he found himself in x. prospect, thirty or forty paces from the hay market, through which he had come.
0x42e2226a612a319e96b5e3c9e187f5f3ad965849 the whole second storey of the house on the left was used as a tavern.
0xcdfcc04c0e6bda6e7efeb71126ff2313c2e691bb all the windows were wide open; judging from the figures moving at the windows, the rooms were full to overflowing.
0xe34db58d76828f1894ebeda7a72812e1577c06df there were sounds of singing, of clarionet and violin, and the boom of a turkish drum.
0x498b1eb484eb2ef68fe85f9f76b9fd68711d46ae he could hear women shrieking.
0xa147b3dc79bdbf859dd15eff9ae688033a86e21c he was about to turn back wondering why he had come to the x. prospect, when suddenly at one of the end windows he saw svidrigaïlov, sitting at a tea-table right in the open window with a pipe in his mouth.
0x52572a15af34c37ea160c0ee9e663318ce2208a9 raskolnikov was dreadfully taken aback, almost terrified.
0xdca09c504fa1f1cc7e5fe6e61ff997bae5d3055d svidrigaïlov was silently watching and scrutinising him and, what struck raskolnikov at once, seemed to be meaning to get up and slip away unobserved.
0xa301e3c760add9e4ce01f5097f122ef7569098f4 raskolnikov at once pretended not to have seen him, but to be looking absent-mindedly away, while he watched him out of the corner of his eye.
0x5914a044d873ddd828d1f937c4981a322b6818be his heart was beating violently.
0x9f892e69690773bc1f600b8300b00c747c53d5f1 yet, it was evident that svidrigaïlov did not want to be seen.
0x69836b643d42f7197087dd518a2bce55b0c5d2c3 he took the pipe out of his mouth and was on the point of concealing himself, but as he got up and moved back his chair, he seemed to have become suddenly aware that raskolnikov had seen him, and was watching him.
0xbd787d0b71d796268b19d435280fd98de76665f6 what had passed between them was much the same as what happened at their first meeting in raskolnikov’s room.
0xf24c765b53ac4c373c08b65cf87641ac6ad316e1 a sly smile came into svidrigaïlov’s face and grew broader and broader.
0x4be365d0bbdcd015c9f446fc40a2de8c47f13c5a each knew that he was seen and watched by the other.
0x5f1004facac6e656af90ea0b49df4f53684f0c92 at last svidrigaïlov broke into a loud laugh.
0xe38b7b60e9603161806a214edde4394bbb73500b “well, well, come in if you want me; i am here!”
0x16104ae9ab100df581b3088f7ae848e2a2f87435 he shouted from the window.
0x928274fb37a838030b186b9cb3356dd04564f5fe raskolnikov went up into the tavern.
0x9aa1c28ca3f9a661f071ea4d010fd589a609f369 he found svidrigaïlov in a tiny back room, adjoining the saloon in which merchants, clerks and numbers of people of all sorts were drinking tea at twenty little tables to the desperate bawling of a chorus of singers.
0xeb455f70ee2f2561e75166ab4b77901ae544aa65 the click of billiard balls could be heard in the distance.
0x7dbdd1510798ed451a708bdab488f2cbcd368999 on the table before svidrigaïlov stood an open bottle and a glass half full of champagne.
0xff70908a42e19391684e3a3922692fcb9be32e14 in the room he found also a boy with a little hand organ, a healthy-looking red-cheeked girl of eighteen, wearing a tucked-up striped skirt, and a tyrolese hat with ribbons.
0x8906affc29d35c8cb3658d4c93bcfe35c14d5166 in spite of the chorus in the other room, she was singing some servants’ hall song in a rather husky contralto, to the accompaniment of the organ.
0x7f96201f269009546a09bd579d6edd7a372304e7 “come, that’s enough,” svidrigaïlov stopped her at raskolnikov’s entrance.
0x65f6f6d943415a343740770d1088511d0bc1bbec the girl at once broke off and stood waiting respectfully.
0xa68361f140966eca6f49bf7594f0e3d7db079fab she had sung her guttural rhymes, too, with a serious and respectful expression in her face.
0xe2cba6f5d7417d1eb7bff9a70cdfcfb1264e9c9b “hey, philip, a glass!”
0xa308eb8757a7e5fb1e1774bf88f9442ca3225eef shouted svidrigaïlov.
0x41cfa122c5154aabfa41d7bca6d969b5f0c45326 “i won’t drink anything,” said raskolnikov.
0x15d84cfba453582b323d9bb5b110e011f843224b “as you like, i didn’t mean it for you.
0x701ff4d8e4e791305f899fde40ece81f53f548ab drink, katia!
0xcb1b7bef5f7e1f245bd365bb093e7087c66d7d6a i don’t want anything more to-day, you can go.”
0x6417bd141098f395241750d020ba0a81c8040b96 he poured her out a full glass, and laid down a yellow note.
0x394eaa2a40767e3ff39269cc8f0aefb58a446ba6 katia drank off her glass of wine, as women do, without putting it down, in twenty gulps, took the note and kissed svidrigaïlov’s hand, which he allowed quite seriously.
0xaf1d87ec802934bfcaf81cfd8512ae21793e5407 she went out of the room and the boy trailed after her with the organ.
0xdc70008b4fa728f2212a9e1762551fa89fd46edd both had been brought in from the street.
0x4d5f1eefa511e0db75d4b57d7471940631e5eff7 svidrigaïlov had not been a week in petersburg, but everything about him was already, so to speak, on a patriarchal footing; the waiter, philip, was by now an old friend and very obsequious.
0x27392843eaf5a3f0ec80b9457e306a7c6e3e80a2 the door leading to the saloon had a lock on it.
0xf22eb0117e138d406a21a3ec108e096775d142f6 svidrigaïlov was at home in this room and perhaps spent whole days in it.
0x1f880947817ac0f9e2c62871713f3134c85102d8 the tavern was dirty and wretched, not even second-rate.
0x03fc8651662df26f7dc0da2a613edde8e9bfeb1b “i was going to see you and looking for you,” raskolnikov began, “but i don’t know what made me turn from the hay market into the x. prospect just now.
0x2d8aea28124cc3a78a8242d40af4a485c0128fec i never take this turning.
0xd3fbf92a00491f51c81c15fa864feb608e2be3d4 i turn to the right from the hay market.
0x8ed788183e6c9d562ebcc2f98e3659e13c09818d and this isn’t the way to you.
0x050b98580286aa8d1bd86f7a79c8217fbff59bea i simply turned and here you are.
0x814c37997da69b1b716c010624b730091a85774b it is strange!”
0xd4837808c59aadbb1fba2d7f459d81fb1f19b56d “why don’t you say at once ‘it’s a miracle’?”
0x993c04206bbc955459ed159dc8a4c6241fe16440 “because it may be only chance.”
0x5549388aea9404cb9f940bece91581ca7dc9f16d “oh, that’s the way with all you folk,” laughed svidrigaïlov.
0x555374d2c1b8f6accbcbd8cf219a85edeb99402e “you won’t admit it, even if you do inwardly believe it a miracle!
0xca435c485ba7942c6584011bb7889495a1646625 here you say that it may be only chance.
0x91e7c187548cadc81c78deebbb9ec9f5020e4636 and what cowards they all are here, about having an opinion of their own, you can’t fancy, rodion romanovitch.
0x5449899bb1daced32a0fca388e32ab822cb31dd3 i don’t mean you, you have an opinion of your own and are not afraid to have it.
0xebd67d44789a453f87e0be31b23d6e84a0f0bb3c that’s how it was you attracted my curiosity.”
0x6f7db86afdf9f469e3462e706c4367fc139e9030 “nothing else?”
0x1669d945a887704631b00dc0e0f879bcfaec404e “well, that’s enough, you know,” svidrigaïlov was obviously exhilarated, but only slightly so, he had not had more than half a glass of wine.
0x6ee21308e1f9cce614b9aaad55f9459ce5fc8a3b “i fancy you came to see me before you knew that i was capable of having what you call an opinion of my own,” observed raskolnikov.
0xa38cc765e915f52136fba90293da502815d2a6a3 “oh, well, it was a different matter.
0x0df560739ef40a8c7813f6c12cb6a6c4a298e3b2 everyone has his own plans.
0xb211afd7dc3a8d1971ada4d07fc5c53470441c8e and apropos of the miracle let me tell you that i think you have been asleep for the last two or three days.
0xd68efcbdeaeb1fe4ea7b6f70cdb5a57b654af451 i told you of this tavern myself, there is no miracle in your coming straight here.
0xeaede9690fb9e79e9840bae9582ecde45800e7f0 i explained the way myself, told you where it was, and the hours you could find me here.
0xe0af3ad0951ecf74f338a40133186543664cfd2f do you remember?”
0x0ef76ebda72530c67ea37d4174520ad57f09beb0 “i don’t remember,” answered raskolnikov with surprise.
0x4ae17d62716e6499a3720c9ca8e62e1bad51ca57 “i believe you.
0x666fc738e0ea0153a58c30fce96b260316f036cf i told you twice.
0x7d248c498abe3f301bb1b4262b6950fadec70c96 the address has been stamped mechanically on your memory.
0xf6c0260eb97198c53ce958d74f60d62b94fb9385 you turned this way mechanically and yet precisely according to the direction, though you are not aware of it.
0xdb70a8f9df61e0f60a809a8b94d7c30b1f654345 when i told you then, i hardly hoped you understood me.
0xb573f486f9c0d60ff3ae694b023538d0cab13cc2 you give yourself away too much, rodion romanovitch.
0xa94214fc713ab63700ad1451156175993594e396 and another thing, i’m convinced there are lots of people in petersburg who talk to themselves as they walk.
0x4fb85d29c750115131a4f8e243300fe32753e465 this is a town of crazy people.
0x9d6cf7dcd767a727b27f1f63954ca20822c65f3e if only we had scientific men, doctors, lawyers and philosophers might make most valuable investigations in petersburg each in his own line.
0x6c18a5823212417998dbd1d333a6d2e7e03ad53a there are few places where there are so many gloomy, strong and queer influences on the soul of man as in petersburg.
0xcc3b556a19f87221fd430b9461e39798bf5ac9d8 the mere influences of climate mean so much.
0x65455fa945d4548bef47f875da9d24b14f7ffb10 and it’s the administrative centre of all russia and its character must be reflected on the whole country.
0xb67b43cdd85dda86c6937bf5eb71e2aaf00f58e4 but that is neither here nor there now.
0xfa8146593051e17c0a6f00adcdd061ca6acd1180 the point is that i have several times watched you.
0x813e00f48045a5a02e8670194f29458427a6cc9d you walk out of your house--holding your head high--twenty paces from home you let it sink, and fold your hands behind your back.
0x8386094c2db7c642899c8f8f2695fb5f19ff6144 you look and evidently see nothing before nor beside you.
0x18d003ee2d47f95f91db39f3c105631769939010 at last you begin moving your lips and talking to yourself, and sometimes you wave one hand and declaim, and at last stand still in the middle of the road.
0xf43d694bf2f220a9b0f69100559fc0d397ac246c that’s not at all the thing.
0x0d2dc0762a591692063ca1ef999dabf674f9abbe someone may be watching you besides me, and it won’t do you any good.
0x6dcd4e131ce94a64942ce32f2c99dd7a729f7e75 it’s nothing really to do with me and i can’t cure you, but, of course, you understand me.”
0xe98c266697fea2afccea86dbb9a54986d7fb492e “do you know that i am being followed?”
0x07b9af7800354f5fc09e2c28f73ea779026b9113 asked raskolnikov, looking inquisitively at him.
0x3ad2515ce16935e41e201122efe4898f9192675b “no, i know nothing about it,” said svidrigaïlov, seeming surprised.
0x1b036970dbd32381f02a4dfb6349b1e1080e749b “well, then, let us leave me alone,” raskolnikov muttered, frowning.
0xc788705f21f64717e17af8c8b1d9a515ff8e9b7e “very good, let us leave you alone.”
0x07e93e78cd246c96dbbbf94a80099ec3538e9267 “you had better tell me, if you come here to drink, and directed me twice to come here to you, why did you hide, and try to get away just now when i looked at the window from the street?
0x61cd491cba768a655247357c6dafe9b8ee2e77ac i saw it.”
0x04f88e0715c6f378152463b3bd0817bab41073f5 “he-he!
0x1ba4ab81d025e5b3a6f0cebb576e230243b83c5c and why was it you lay on your sofa with closed eyes and pretended to be asleep, though you were wide awake while i stood in your doorway?
0x61cd491cba768a655247357c6dafe9b8ee2e77ac i saw it.”
0x0df4040dd2380dabc34f53fe89b01b2895120d00 “i may have had... reasons.
0xaa1a2a87d11bf33badbe6c48e2006532636340e7 you know that yourself.”
0x42d918ce44867bc0409826e6d861d6f535963746 “and i may have had my reasons, though you don’t know them.”
0x0fa4701e8d0ca9358e5b493bad96a8a695015e96 raskolnikov dropped his right elbow on the table, leaned his chin in the fingers of his right hand, and stared intently at svidrigaïlov.
0x77937bb6ca849ecbdf9f5c881092971c5e1b5d79 for a full minute he scrutinised his face, which had impressed him before.
0xde907a4cbe0e0161d987ddb5c863d22eab6e60a2 it was a strange face, like a mask; white and red, with bright red lips, with a flaxen beard, and still thick flaxen hair.
0x636f97299ad5f8c534b5743cda2ca1f1c64401ee his eyes were somehow too blue and their expression somehow too heavy and fixed.
0x5e60c4fd3ddcf8307c584636bcf158e97af52cd2 there was something awfully unpleasant in that handsome face, which looked so wonderfully young for his age.
0x0eec54c992625accd765d040e0d2cc97d9bb6a9d svidrigaïlov was smartly dressed in light summer clothes and was particularly dainty in his linen.
0x7441917396dbbd7f2c582b82c22ff2672d8e72f3 he wore a huge ring with a precious stone in it.
0x16f14217c98ebcb58e09fb9296b00830d211657d “have i got to bother myself about you, too, now?”
0x63d46a9497cf7b21c44e3021259430722467abf3 said raskolnikov suddenly, coming with nervous impatience straight to the point.
0xdb642d7307e7efde9d9cfa7d5742b6fd3d2a8f90 “even though perhaps you are the most dangerous man if you care to injure me, i don’t want to put myself out any more.
0x1c09e1a57ba847a166dfd0c9601bc59e24835c9b i will show you at once that i don’t prize myself as you probably think i do.
0x921a6b90f49137bc3a3e7f81c3bbd406897c9f84 i’ve come to tell you at once that if you keep to your former intentions with regard to my sister and if you think to derive any benefit in that direction from what has been discovered of late, i will kill you before you get me locked up.
0x844998e1e5be64608288e8565610ed16fe0bf191 you can reckon on my word.
0xe740a78d8cb728e6c7ebfc9ce9b381ff5ef9b19d you know that i can keep it.
0x734df0bfd15552107a4fda9ec07e28b0bc3c1a39 and in the second place if you want to tell me anything--for i keep fancying all this time that you have something to tell me--make haste and tell it, for time is precious and very likely it will soon be too late.”
0x81a5acae5884c647cccfcaa1a53045a5c8bc360e “why in such haste?”
0x8bc6f50208c99179d872548d57aecddff469c404 asked svidrigaïlov, looking at him curiously.
0x538c61d5b682b41d5e616750e052e7b634170fe7 “everyone has his plans,” raskolnikov answered gloomily and impatiently.
0xf2626ef1ac0243dadc92beaf7d80c10752a1754c “you urged me yourself to frankness just now, and at the first question you refuse to answer,” svidrigaïlov observed with a smile.
0x8cc7dfbf719f90c455ee96048774b22144e17999 “you keep fancying that i have aims of my own and so you look at me with suspicion.
0x068180b6740198ce813894b86f72a8b583d4906f of course it’s perfectly natural in your position.
0xf4310b46164e3f18b54bc0477bc5e1c5129ee5ab but though i should like to be friends with you, i shan’t trouble myself to convince you of the contrary.
0x26053459474c3a0c2103f475ef3a812bf7f42d95 the game isn’t worth the candle and i wasn’t intending to talk to you about anything special.”
0x042ddfb4b3766aeda8f63922522ba2c95f1d5bc4 “what did you want me, for, then?
0x1a28be084fdf59a98b5690c9ec723cf30f10c093 it was you who came hanging about me.”
0xa75806d7af5bb55c86dbec09d5cf6789f8c2a4e5 “why, simply as an interesting subject for observation.
0x66564454b94aa7ba35fdc79e7e2c4304cb4ab2bf i liked the fantastic nature of your position--that’s what it was!
0x0ccf2f4325502821ce2069083724df17e8c756d7 besides you are the brother of a person who greatly interested me, and from that person i had in the past heard a very great deal about you, from which i gathered that you had a great influence over her; isn’t that enough?
0x8d357b7018d255da26623138dbd6ccebb439314b ha-ha-ha!
0x0d3f55b2eb28a4a20952a1ec1971ecd69518c33e still i must admit that your question is rather complex, and is difficult for me to answer.
0xecb2d585a969faa17cd9ad1850f024a0dc9d429c here, you, for instance, have come to me not only for a definite object, but for the sake of hearing something new.
0x9e2a95a984ea353cee2ee3db004ecb7512dd0b27 isn’t that so?
0x541bb72bc6af0f8674418d9e67767790940f980e isn’t that so?”
0xdb3dd89f6acc26e887ea2fe2abe2910f41fabb2d persisted svidrigaïlov with a sly smile.
0x16bd5f116bb348e734138c7c8787aa3e7814d262 “well, can’t you fancy then that i, too, on my way here in the train was reckoning on you, on your telling me something new, and on my making some profit out of you!
0x2294486bcb0719a582ebda9f00f3f962ed26c1b6 you see what rich men we are!”
0xedf6b2975b290fbf6e71965c51d69d68850951a5 “what profit could you make?”
0x191ac01ceeaf54b44a5caf80c379edfbb32a4409 “how can i tell you?
0x79e4113cafffe716d5457584d7bed63b79277142 how do i know?
0x8ceeefb2f271bc595e1f628859477c414789a44c you see in what a tavern i spend all my time and it’s my enjoyment, that’s to say it’s no great enjoyment, but one must sit somewhere; that poor katia now--you saw her?... if only i had been a glutton now, a club gourmand, but you see i can eat this.”
0xfad54bdedf3946bf9268d1d09739d2d8b7a45f3f he pointed to a little table in the corner where the remnants of a terrible-looking beef-steak and potatoes lay on a tin dish.
0x414025c59ffd75892a48a83c8e2d81c5d0d78035 “have you dined, by the way?
0x974475287482e954b97d010d5218c8063ec20303 i’ve had something and want nothing more.
0xeb426cb1981609e4c224716870b0092772d7d402 i don’t drink, for instance, at all.
0x33913aa43db11767c299a05c4c84ff95b02c4c4e except for champagne i never touch anything, and not more than a glass of that all the evening, and even that is enough to make my head ache.
0xae608ad9c2f4d17f6f215a632233464111ca90b6 i ordered it just now to wind myself up, for i am just going off somewhere and you see me in a peculiar state of mind.
0x3aba305af2fe984df03396d1baa42c12b0272200 that was why i hid myself just now like a schoolboy, for i was afraid you would hinder me.
0xd6b8d45351bd9b64436e28db5dfe2823b519820d but i believe,” he pulled out his watch, “i can spend an hour with you.
0xe293b0f5400835db1751ed94d67d06df671ddbc4 it’s half-past four now.
0x7954373e3ceacc064a19880bc005ac10d5ffd96a if only i’d been something, a landowner, a father, a cavalry officer, a photographer, a journalist... i am nothing, no specialty, and sometimes i am positively bored.
0x210aee4a21a50f6bc59d7785c1d21b6277f428ef i really thought you would tell me something new.”
0xb049e8c6a4f49758972e95e5e9b7734f3c134a8f “but what are you, and why have you come here?”
0x270b9621e13ee459abe333c0dfeaaf19e19cfb6e “what am i?
0x602e2674d86ef50b771b38edaf0037d44ba86861 you know, a gentleman, i served for two years in the cavalry, then i knocked about here in petersburg, then i married marfa petrovna and lived in the country.
0x38ce9ebf1b1639c7c2a43d1f057bee5b1f7074df there you have my biography!”
0x5980a392960d43a12a21430c6f84349fc6dc5de5 “you are a gambler, i believe?”
0x97d15e4c2020568d77ef59d899caf6f9fd4aeef6 “no, a poor sort of gambler.
0x13902556de1128439ab3cf6b5fb10a7dd8d45b3d a card-sharper--not a gambler.”
0x4dae465be0b88296e301c1e0bef127c9ffa9d6f0 “you have been a card-sharper then?”
0xbbdb209b727f6bf1a34b534d98a0be24481f7c36 “yes, i’ve been a card-sharper too.”
0x79c382d663090665da545e18e9748ad888433ec4 “didn’t you get thrashed sometimes?”
0x83d2d94a870e6c85debd9bd69d344e654a6e6d9e “it did happen.
0x9d2d308f9dd3c36583792d0b7012e4f511b13634 why?”
0x247533ba75350b226418211efb1369c29efff246 “why, you might have challenged them... altogether it must have been lively.”
0xae2abde7366020e644f97d8822ac7079ec13a939 “i won’t contradict you, and besides i am no hand at philosophy.
0x124cd7df2f9cdf95a34c6b49309f7ec76db46f07 i confess that i hastened here for the sake of the women.”
0x9bcac46af96063a1df366a7762732355387e8a45 “as soon as you buried marfa petrovna?”
0xbc9f8813eb850aea8e33edd711b13172963a2396 “quite so,” svidrigaïlov smiled with engaging candour.
0x53fa6b46570e1b1bda71705142845a5744b82052 “what of it?
0x2bb2da2c8017c7be39073f9f7b2c991b7dbc75e0 you seem to find something wrong in my speaking like that about women?”
0x168ce52c040c18c999e90f09694201d835627492 “you ask whether i find anything wrong in vice?”
0x10c44286578725bca1f50e9f1beb01d7114a32cf “vice!
0x97ed444686a06cba6bc98427e6cd57843d57a3e7 oh, that’s what you are after!
0x6816279f91e5a8cfbc852021ca086f5ec1cb521b but i’ll answer you in order, first about women in general; you know i am fond of talking.
0x7488e55d0c984a264713e052da828d86f26ee60a tell me, what should i restrain myself for?
0xd43f0a7ba90d9e8190ec1c37f404a1ccbc11fade why should i give up women, since i have a passion for them?
0x079de76ee23d374cb11a1b8de0b6acf6cebe38b9 it’s an occupation, anyway.”
0x6b3ca2b70505f3e4765ef72c963a58cb8d31cf8d “so you hope for nothing here but vice?”
0x0af75cf265f3db7be9e7eec3be9209be2648be6f “oh, very well, for vice then.
0x7d63a8411a39069fe2b1d6644d43777440975493 you insist on its being vice.
0x70ede9a047ee2dbd71fb64f391b98716de4bdd35 but anyway i like a direct question.
0xd7ede0f97af08e4ddaf2bc89804061ea44603343 in this vice at least there is something permanent, founded indeed upon nature and not dependent on fantasy, something present in the blood like an ever-burning ember, for ever setting one on fire and, maybe, not to be quickly extinguished, even with years.
0x4be61f36900483e0a5910fc4815f74a1ba322c01 you’ll agree it’s an occupation of a sort.”
0xe783931397e9b8cc2b4253da5386e444c18cbc80 “that’s nothing to rejoice at, it’s a disease and a dangerous one.”
0xc63b02d8ad232c6fc5a260b63c64b0d889afc209 “oh, that’s what you think, is it!
0x21f51402d4cd16490d5667b33eebbb969100dca0 i agree, that it is a disease like everything that exceeds moderation.
0x9daaa9d962a347a38fee1bb33e06fd23724745f4 and, of course, in this one must exceed moderation.
0x24ae5787095b46a12edaa8539a670e21d7524490 but in the first place, everybody does so in one way or another, and in the second place, of course, one ought to be moderate and prudent, however mean it may be, but what am i to do?
0x81ec638e1c718dde793598a353d1b9c49a1e1fb7 if i hadn’t this, i might have to shoot myself.
0x6f4324d00899d449ed81db014f4aa2a03e47ca97 i am ready to admit that a decent man ought to put up with being bored, but yet...” “and could you shoot yourself?”
0x478cdee11b2df98fb38796741a4a2b36c5540098 “oh, come!”
0x92a6092a398ded51966ee7b2a9ae16acfad2d7a9 svidrigaïlov parried with disgust.
0x607b01e0ec9a41b39d2e6bb74d5f48637951bbba “please don’t speak of it,” he added hurriedly and with none of the bragging tone he had shown in all the previous conversation.
0x6f6968e093ba5bb85b2515c488238bb5c6de8496 his face quite changed.
0x00e4a30233ff4dfd67e38ba5fd9c730d505ad469 “i admit it’s an unpardonable weakness, but i can’t help it.
0x42a8827fe409d3260801e1bc71d113cb9e7ca436 i am afraid of death and i dislike its being talked of.
0xd83289a72ac9ceb22c21e56ee912b2f97b54ab90 do you know that i am to a certain extent a mystic?”
0x6f8a40de942a6b7ec2429473845ba0dd6116b420 “ah, the apparitions of marfa petrovna!
0xee502cffeee9396e230f7b39a694a842e7e6fde6 do they still go on visiting you?”
0xdb7d4b7020b9aa5e314c8acd000c2e27c2129bd1 “oh, don’t talk of them; there have been no more in petersburg, confound them!”
0x6537224dba4cd25f4d9b033812c40ecd0c61fef7 he cried with an air of irritation.
0x85c258d5f056a5725378e99af62cc8e2ec00821d “let’s rather talk of that... though... h’m!
0xb878899ca90746e6dd73a5d8fd74c6f2165e8493 i have not much time, and can’t stay long with you, it’s a pity!
0xde61917a17c7ca5522cbc6278160fb468d1befbe i should have found plenty to tell you.”
0xf0192346eaf5b9cce2acdc4be3da2e4f22ee8f7b “what’s your engagement, a woman?”
0x3e67999e94949b23746304254d7c1abc8e2ee198 “yes, a woman, a casual incident.... no, that’s not what i want to talk of.”
0x558796a46f3501e63fc7a9a0db357fe08c7b6d66 “and the hideousness, the filthiness of all your surroundings, doesn’t that affect you?
0xb1807eccad7bea588d21c9b7f02c26da4d6b7d92 have you lost the strength to stop yourself?”
0xe19de014510bbc82939ba2a9fe6bc17e4c8083b1 “and do you pretend to strength, too?
0x257c3f8129ecf12d3d8dfeee379e9c6d4708a00e he-he-he!
0x59956a9270b7bb421c1dbe84f0df989ef669d957 you surprised me just now, rodion romanovitch, though i knew beforehand it would be so.
0xdf858f3ab58adf8f8470ba3420ad9317304f255f you preach to me about vice and æsthetics!
0x417a0829aab849894f22421a151a340c196c62f5 you--a schiller, you--an idealist!
0x041773120263e126f181f26666acd137a68dffb2 of course that’s all as it should be and it would be surprising if it were not so, yet it is strange in reality.... ah, what a pity i have no time, for you’re a most interesting type!
0x47c9ed753bf14362768b806ff917ef9d2bc22536 and, by-the-way, are you fond of schiller?
0xa0cb9b7ee518f3f265ffc2a6aecf2a9212d27723 i am awfully fond of him.”
0xac5700bc8df60dd77a5545a19b9c66087b7dff87 “but what a braggart you are,” raskolnikov said with some disgust.
0xa04cdfa59375a33b1efd950e411df43e299c13e6 “upon my word, i am not,” answered svidrigaïlov laughing.
0x12208a1f9445d6b1d7d23c0f2efd7b13e17ed191 “however, i won’t dispute it, let me be a braggart, why not brag, if it hurts no one?
0x462966360b3ec0f6fe87e9432eb1e017d12cd6fd i spent seven years in the country with marfa petrovna, so now when i come across an intelligent person like you--intelligent and highly interesting--i am simply glad to talk and, besides, i’ve drunk that half-glass of champagne and it’s gone to my head a little.
0x6945dfdc86192e0f62e435df9a4e1fbfffc9098a and besides, there’s a certain fact that has wound me up tremendously, but about that i... will keep quiet.
0xdbe3205a19283c6fb6c7459e0a995fbb86826616 where are you off to?”
0xf0d7a2b54ab81cd7844868d6c3e70f1e489d09be he asked in alarm.
0xe0e457066fcba6b06315107c20ffb69c2393a71e raskolnikov had begun getting up.
0x764ad73817898468453d734d87d0a4bf451f738c he felt oppressed and stifled and, as it were, ill at ease at having come here.
0xfd69ad75ccf1ce61c7cc2bd533eefde9c114c004 he felt convinced that svidrigaïlov was the most worthless scoundrel on the face of the earth.
0xb2d4f9f6f46cc00ac61a799cd4498d65655ea531 “a-ach!
0xfed5b90ef40ca745e087b68a76c6934542a51d8e sit down, stay a little!”
0xbd3a7a30fa142032eebc355c3f5ece40496ab055 svidrigaïlov begged.
0xbba1cb2cfb382cf6fc49c41a7ff6d45c07fd61ad “let them bring you some tea, anyway.
0xcd835b309b685cfc30b7ea68e0acc60160111eff stay a little, i won’t talk nonsense, about myself, i mean.
0xdd36c839e4853167a72ca8da10eef394c4fe6414 i’ll tell you something.
0x28a3e6a5a0e1ff7bf7ac078f697c985dca1623f7 if you like i’ll tell you how a woman tried ‘to save’ me, as you would call it?
0x551f8e7978762d6f9f8f9f53fb5cfd244b9acd24 it will be an answer to your first question indeed, for the woman was your sister.
0x0b60f057528d10b4a8fe490a4c2f1059536ac478 may i tell you?
0x8366d0c27b3b58e6c65bf3a3f9490197269937cf it will help to spend the time.”
0x79b258901ef09a7e04aee1a4e22794ba2fc04839 “tell me, but i trust that you...” “oh, don’t be uneasy.
0x3fe3e765239af73d849480cd1e51456732726ddb besides, even in a worthless low fellow like me, avdotya romanovna can only excite the deepest respect.”
0x20df98f7948303be83128a38cdb4f79d883278af chapter iv “you know perhaps--yes, i told you myself,” began svidrigaïlov, “that i was in the debtors’ prison here, for an immense sum, and had not any expectation of being able to pay it.
0xed298bf2e3d69e5d74d406cf1fd3140cec376c1e there’s no need to go into particulars how marfa petrovna bought me out; do you know to what a point of insanity a woman can sometimes love?
0x676a8b5699cbcd2b87bc208a81dae1dc6afd3b75 she was an honest woman, and very sensible, although completely uneducated.
0xf372afab6dd4f245dc8beae26d8878478bcbb03d would you believe that this honest and jealous woman, after many scenes of hysterics and reproaches, condescended to enter into a kind of contract with me which she kept throughout our married life?
0x8e5fac653c544ae52d63f77f865f4794758494f3 she was considerably older than i, and besides, she always kept a clove or something in her mouth.
0x6185d1f5bfda99c85cea8cb7adcb488d07bf4802 there was so much swinishness in my soul and honesty too, of a sort, as to tell her straight out that i couldn’t be absolutely faithful to her.
0xaadc329bb546ea0cc61aac78c11aeded4ab9ea5b this confession drove her to frenzy, but yet she seems in a way to have liked my brutal frankness.
0x83ff9ce5118177ff07ca2ed5e29bac015a54d67b she thought it showed i was unwilling to deceive her if i warned her like this beforehand and for a jealous woman, you know, that’s the first consideration.
0xd5190ee2cd6dd271f5e0e5e9cbd7ac73f15310ac after many tears an unwritten contract was drawn up between us: first, that i would never leave marfa petrovna and would always be her husband; secondly, that i would never absent myself without her permission; thirdly, that i would never set up a permanent mistress; fourthly, in return for this, marfa petrovna gave me a free hand with the maidservants, but only with her secret knowledge; fifthly, god forbid my falling in love with a woman of our class; sixthly, in case i--which god forbid--should be visited by a great serious passion i was bound to reveal it to marfa petrovna.
0xe98c6912673238bd42c22da31c2c7cfc3b987c63 on this last score, however, marfa petrovna was fairly at ease.
0xf12c651673762b02a9642e167582432c9950c5c8 she was a sensible woman and so she could not help looking upon me as a dissolute profligate incapable of real love.
0x18344709e556a981941bbd784775609ccbbea4b9 but a sensible woman and a jealous woman are two very different things, and that’s where the trouble came in.
0xcff29320641531ba10f8b2d46198953b9246e8e0 but to judge some people impartially we must renounce certain preconceived opinions and our habitual attitude to the ordinary people about us.
0x6dd218a53d45bf7832cc1473ae07d81605aa6f74 i have reason to have faith in your judgment rather than in anyone’s.
0x2270a0733eb88749083fe8ff6dc9560accae99dd perhaps you have already heard a great deal that was ridiculous and absurd about marfa petrovna.
0x9efbc2bcd1ebecde6e7ad9e880acf1865a5d9762 she certainly had some very ridiculous ways, but i tell you frankly that i feel really sorry for the innumerable woes of which i was the cause.
0x3df94e7bfd6e73668e621975895f0ece8a210e2c well, and that’s enough, i think, by way of a decorous _oraison funèbre_ for the most tender wife of a most tender husband.
0x1c9ea2c4bae54e0188a37969383a77b6ed1ed8df when we quarrelled, i usually held my tongue and did not irritate her and that gentlemanly conduct rarely failed to attain its object, it influenced her, it pleased her, indeed.
0x7d2703587a9c216ae5b59642c0dd48dd77b1b559 these were times when she was positively proud of me.
0x17176dd77a5482610cc530617ee7b4ca7ba102ec but your sister she couldn’t put up with, anyway.
0xa986f52f7095bb1feb1aabc1d776017a9f6c8ebc and however she came to risk taking such a beautiful creature into her house as a governess.
0x8fe5b3dd52abc1edc2ef12868da710351dd3225f my explanation is that marfa petrovna was an ardent and impressionable woman and simply fell in love herself--literally fell in love--with your sister.
0x97cd6a008a1eb91a2cb19a8167eed57a52c5859c well, little wonder--look at avdotya romanovna!
0x2db146dcdd406d80aae9f409caafeb7d3e042873 i saw the danger at the first glance and what do you think, i resolved not to look at her even.
0x72597d9b60c0aba03fada4c11f7f2f68db48d7b8 but avdotya romanovna herself made the first step, would you believe it?
0xb3daaa4e7d00795f2a6c23803df0c605d2df460b would you believe it too that marfa petrovna was positively angry with me at first for my persistent silence about your sister, for my careless reception of her continual adoring praises of avdotya romanovna.
0xdff5618d48172735b3ffa5905570f9c808fd5015 i don’t know what it was she wanted!
0x8851920a66ba4483d3e10df71b14113a517a4e69 well, of course, marfa petrovna told avdotya romanovna every detail about me.
0x80ad97360a6d47b4165298a2355e7a978a6f8443 she had the unfortunate habit of telling literally everyone all our family secrets and continually complaining of me; how could she fail to confide in such a delightful new friend?
0xceb21a094ba51ee2505ecdaf61816155364a2c39 i expect they talked of nothing else but me and no doubt avdotya romanovna heard all those dark mysterious rumours that were current about me.... i don’t mind betting that you too have heard something of the sort already?”
0xda38c83a047a005ebdca036a53e4021d838d6b64 “i have.
0xbbfdfc99e850ed9aa744fbc50598d9dd99d46033 luzhin charged you with having caused the death of a child.
0x9dca1f87297e66545c2c7665c93d18215f1a27d9 is that true?”
0x56aecfc5909698cc613d7889ebfadad2d0259a4d “don’t refer to those vulgar tales, i beg,” said svidrigaïlov with disgust and annoyance.
0x99fc0dae6506da997364a8d15a9ba7566e3fbd50 “if you insist on wanting to know about all that idiocy, i will tell you one day, but now...” “i was told too about some footman of yours in the country whom you treated badly.”
0xb7e35ffa162a809b911c4a839ca6b73d988c4314 “i beg you to drop the subject,” svidrigaïlov interrupted again with obvious impatience.
0xe0de8ef7d15f3ac7667795b6643427466e026178 “was that the footman who came to you after death to fill your pipe?... you told me about it yourself.”
0x370a0d8d52624ce6a9a465024275edeaa297bb83 raskolnikov felt more and more irritated.
0xddb9fb669fd93c1d99f9758316e91dfe1ffacd21 svidrigaïlov looked at him attentively and raskolnikov fancied he caught a flash of spiteful mockery in that look.
0x2b1ad157c6a96f8565c2f0e83a24d60b3e98a145 but svidrigaïlov restrained himself and answered very civilly: “yes, it was.
0x2dfa2e210574af216da80de6e6cc8e5e02cec56b i see that you, too, are extremely interested and shall feel it my duty to satisfy your curiosity at the first opportunity.
0x34d2ca84d3be227080d3abe217a6afae40896361 upon my soul!
0x059e4446bfb6b105d34fc5bc4c75ebd0f20b4ce2 i see that i really might pass for a romantic figure with some people.
0x72e221e68dcce9828e78d89b3055f394e722ed85 judge how grateful i must be to marfa petrovna for having repeated to avdotya romanovna such mysterious and interesting gossip about me.
0xd49be81f1f7c6e21afb7d3469fa64473abcf3b9a i dare not guess what impression it made on her, but in any case it worked in my interests.
0xf96d1fa64ae1e0ecf88951d55cb8afecfb68108c with all avdotya romanovna’s natural aversion and in spite of my invariably gloomy and repellent aspect--she did at least feel pity for me, pity for a lost soul.
0x809e4fa548b290e461dfc7d7e561a96af9786454 and if once a girl’s heart is moved to _pity_, it’s more dangerous than anything.
0x0836fdea1448cec9f5693811d1ed61c85dd4023c she is bound to want to ‘save him,’ to bring him to his senses, and lift him up and draw him to nobler aims, and restore him to new life and usefulness--well, we all know how far such dreams can go.
0xf8f04377b3c606a5e7ede4e415723c7cab895cd2 i saw at once that the bird was flying into the cage of herself.
0x4fccff3570684898cf602792ca82b28cc0ac9955 and i too made ready.
0x3d77b44a413e64d0e22575fe531c4a1a8a701473 i think you are frowning, rodion romanovitch?
0xd26de472db5dbdc677cab6f7cc8717cb7fb94a60 there’s no need.
0xafbc50fcd93e7de4b9131fbb1e6f4364167c9f8e as you know, it all ended in smoke.
0xb94dcbadb0b55bf713990e3d93048dc39dd6fb6e (hang it all, what a lot i am drinking!)
0x7849225dadd8e968b20f63f924b1b814987fc7ce do you know, i always, from the very beginning, regretted that it wasn’t your sister’s fate to be born in the second or third century a.d., as the daughter of a reigning prince or some governor or pro-consul in asia minor.
0x1b986e9599d75c1eacaf7bec6ee726afec357de6 she would undoubtedly have been one of those who would endure martyrdom and would have smiled when they branded her bosom with hot pincers.
0xaf3329ee0d3a55ba784164bbd8c79f961b6596e1 and she would have gone to it of herself.
0x1e5eed2d392073e91f00e4e7fb26e7abc46e271d and in the fourth or fifth century she would have walked away into the egyptian desert and would have stayed there thirty years living on roots and ecstasies and visions.
0xc9c43f895f682281104dece6a3e370e94e42ddd3 she is simply thirsting to face some torture for someone, and if she can’t get her torture, she’ll throw herself out of a window.
0xe8ba19177478f49628b55473aa53400f77813309 i’ve heard something of a mr. razumihin--he’s said to be a sensible fellow; his surname suggests it, indeed.
0xf3e075f30f141215bb7d0ce7ae9a81c6ea3f3b7e he’s probably a divinity student.
0xfec1198dcd9aa4a8730ed0fb2c0085857e4a9e6b well, he’d better look after your sister!
0x9b81b56ca4d8fc17643b3a5f168aa4a2484b4717 i believe i understand her, and i am proud of it.
0xfc1331fcee3569e6dc1d041597adac42b67418e6 but at the beginning of an acquaintance, as you know, one is apt to be more heedless and stupid.
0x7535fbb09740a84d0cbdba6da665a339f0ce605e one doesn’t see clearly.
0xac6338b9adea3493debdc7ced23d5ae1d1a13497 hang it all, why is she so handsome?
0xadf7161eabd5f0c60239805ef8871189e75db492 it’s not my fault.
0xb93ca3fee7c61ca46d4c8f928becfcc7716ff21f in fact, it began on my side with a most irresistible physical desire.
0xd697d6446abf00530afd113077e96207de6b47ce avdotya romanovna is awfully chaste, incredibly and phenomenally so.
0x4a4f4f70cc538150c0907e2be953f7fc3d9654d6 take note, i tell you this about your sister as a fact.
0x720acb5031aeb5073ddbc2831f45fea6e2e7c380 she is almost morbidly chaste, in spite of her broad intelligence, and it will stand in her way.
0x0df52152650a173c738499303b3b2f363c1227cd there happened to be a girl in the house then, parasha, a black-eyed wench, whom i had never seen before--she had just come from another village--very pretty, but incredibly stupid: she burst into tears, wailed so that she could be heard all over the place and caused scandal.
0x8853c0fec791a2f78c5f48750b80b5b894d83f46 one day after dinner avdotya romanovna followed me into an avenue in the garden and with flashing eyes _insisted_ on my leaving poor parasha alone.
0xa1c4d18dba783776b77d468435ecf222a0e3f203 it was almost our first conversation by ourselves.
0x04a15272f9533159f9095ca8538539c6ffb6788d i, of course, was only too pleased to obey her wishes, tried to appear disconcerted, embarrassed, in fact played my part not badly.
0xb2da40d5c5b1ab4fec217e5a647b4b4e11522561 then came interviews, mysterious conversations, exhortations, entreaties, supplications, even tears--would you believe it, even tears?
0x448256703bcea89044424726f8737d266deb9b0c think what the passion for propaganda will bring some girls to!
0x290ebde90e56d850fcc81c8014de00e956695f94 i, of course, threw it all on my destiny, posed as hungering and thirsting for light, and finally resorted to the most powerful weapon in the subjection of the female heart, a weapon which never fails one.
0x99c3b0ad01b901a8afa907848494181ec484dba8 it’s the well-known resource--flattery.
0x9d84ed4557f9d96827647d1e32434dd91242aa34 nothing in the world is harder than speaking the truth and nothing easier than flattery.
0x26349531df423c3b0242f3ea2f2788a770fc8848 if there’s the hundredth part of a false note in speaking the truth, it leads to a discord, and that leads to trouble.
0x11fe19c42986cece0d42b09fa61bb48e6c6e31a0 but if all, to the last note, is false in flattery, it is just as agreeable, and is heard not without satisfaction.
0xdc546b43dc517bc6cbc6ab1858cba4a6027428e3 it may be a coarse satisfaction, but still a satisfaction.
0xe1b79d50b264b972519a175305747e5641c8cfe6 and however coarse the flattery, at least half will be sure to seem true.
0xf5a72dd8502eb21f0a04609ec236eed53deee84b that’s so for all stages of development and classes of society.
0x6acbe656b5eb1b31e5e2dcdf007570540fe81b1b a vestal virgin might be seduced by flattery.
0x2082c2bd1028a7c4f3ee8d0c0abbd13046e960a4 i can never remember without laughter how i once seduced a lady who was devoted to her husband, her children, and her principles.
0x90f5c2975eb75807c3f5c6899f3402fbe2096b30 what fun it was and how little trouble!
0xb32367798b938041e40c3e6eb163d71d88af9916 and the lady really had principles--of her own, anyway.
0x59fea8f9712a955255c7795bad497eff041916bd all my tactics lay in simply being utterly annihilated and prostrate before her purity.
0x3b4c0bda25cda2fec21cb4bd975b1f7928cd1fb8 i flattered her shamelessly, and as soon as i succeeded in getting a pressure of the hand, even a glance from her, i would reproach myself for having snatched it by force, and would declare that she had resisted, so that i could never have gained anything but for my being so unprincipled.
0x0df52fcb355722140bd209be6b34a241eead6b42 i maintained that she was so innocent that she could not foresee my treachery, and yielded to me unconsciously, unawares, and so on.
0x893f2fdc2c36cbd01b87b7a76b964e7af655e380 in fact, i triumphed, while my lady remained firmly convinced that she was innocent, chaste, and faithful to all her duties and obligations and had succumbed quite by accident.
0xb66a5250061f1c5c513973f7e7ce0dfb47af50a4 and how angry she was with me when i explained to her at last that it was my sincere conviction that she was just as eager as i. poor marfa petrovna was awfully weak on the side of flattery, and if i had only cared to, i might have had all her property settled on me during her lifetime.
0x4e245c6216b8c230d3cbe74a601889371f0c55ec (i am drinking an awful lot of wine now and talking too much.)
0x789d9844924f0777187b1aa75e371a18a503f54f i hope you won’t be angry if i mention now that i was beginning to produce the same effect on avdotya romanovna.
0x68fdf3f973b2e5f837e3ac15deaf21940f38433c but i was stupid and impatient and spoiled it all.
0x3d8da3eda8578f1784eb6bf99cad4dc1b0bbe7a3 avdotya romanovna had several times--and one time in particular--been greatly displeased by the expression of my eyes, would you believe it?
0x949c89c113b760cdd1a0e001a2585ce0b0dadfbf there was sometimes a light in them which frightened her and grew stronger and stronger and more unguarded till it was hateful to her.
0x983e6058a287430935189054e2c67d6398db4b6f no need to go into detail, but we parted.
0x21b93c160fb56abcc8e4cb4a3e15383f55195125 there i acted stupidly again.
0xea95d715b4f6f3fcc551eed99d5530d5df44808f i fell to jeering in the coarsest way at all such propaganda and efforts to convert me; parasha came on to the scene again, and not she alone; in fact there was a tremendous to-do.
0x5cb0b667328b285567ef352afaa8f6e9bf858f0f ah, rodion romanovitch, if you could only see how your sister’s eyes can flash sometimes!
0xbde6e0b4659b7c8812dc7ed8ec08055fb0f92481 never mind my being drunk at this moment and having had a whole glass of wine.
0xad0ca60de59e9ac0cb2aae8356aad0d2045ffb84 i am speaking the truth.
0x48009ddd050c84d0450b4a8f6516db646fdadd40 i assure you that this glance has haunted my dreams; the very rustle of her dress was more than i could stand at last.
0x18f97d41c356ba77893282d3d06362da41001ef4 i really began to think that i might become epileptic.
0x336405f08baa61a7cb778228bcec8076f153edf8 i could never have believed that i could be moved to such a frenzy.
0xa559fcaf3b3acd9815fe5c3d24c36a71bd60c073 it was essential, indeed, to be reconciled, but by then it was impossible.
0xe343fe495566417a24adab0f5fd788440c68b4b3 and imagine what i did then!
0x02b9284a2ce290b2eba466c96d51682d4c68b614 to what a pitch of stupidity a man can be brought by frenzy!
0xab63bf5697b7e3900dd0796674810f660793dd86 never undertake anything in a frenzy, rodion romanovitch.
0x2539a71c64da71d02a2d7447270a368d29c95eb6 i reflected that avdotya romanovna was after all a beggar (ach, excuse me, that’s not the word... but does it matter if it expresses the meaning?), that she lived by her work, that she had her mother and you to keep (ach, hang it, you are frowning again), and i resolved to offer her all my money--thirty thousand roubles i could have realised then--if she would run away with me here, to petersburg.
0xcbbb8e038eb5e67701653250b921d84179369789 of course i should have vowed eternal love, rapture, and so on.
0x941d6b1226decd9f7258126a75ecacbf6b0db6fb do you know, i was so wild about her at that time that if she had told me to poison marfa petrovna or to cut her throat and to marry herself, it would have been done at once!
0xcba8db21ca84fa873be664606b70410aa18394fd but it ended in the catastrophe of which you know already.
0xc9fd414368265f3fbbc2940dcd3b744945c7ed3e you can fancy how frantic i was when i heard that marfa petrovna had got hold of that scoundrelly attorney, luzhin, and had almost made a match between them--which would really have been just the same thing as i was proposing.
0x2f064fdb89bb2e4fa71ddce44429505b1830d955 wouldn’t it?
0x2f064fdb89bb2e4fa71ddce44429505b1830d955 wouldn’t it?
0x58e4473ab9c1e7b3b94b28a5423b673a10eac380 i notice that you’ve begun to be very attentive... you interesting young man....” svidrigaïlov struck the table with his fist impatiently.
0xe9306d0770609f39175918af464606c44f154799 he was flushed.
0x3d1ff6a4a5bdf36212e4974fec579b1a1b0adae5 raskolnikov saw clearly that the glass or glass and a half of champagne that he had sipped almost unconsciously was affecting him--and he resolved to take advantage of the opportunity.
0x6ea42ed1950caad4a62ec65d2d00b33d372632be he felt very suspicious of svidrigaïlov.
0xdbd318f2515f6fb5b7f5f9d86024fb165d1c0e86 “well, after what you have said, i am fully convinced that you have come to petersburg with designs on my sister,” he said directly to svidrigaïlov, in order to irritate him further.
0x8092f72b05b9497e62b21ddfeb5c155325f004c7 “oh, nonsense,” said svidrigaïlov, seeming to rouse himself.
0xd1727823745dc5f28e8f2f8856fe3ce0de196819 “why, i told you... besides your sister can’t endure me.”
0x63fdc44f5e448d3adebdb10adee1a01b7190f932 “yes, i am certain that she can’t, but that’s not the point.”
0xc5e606e5a627bc2d64bee7b2860c06fbeddb504b “are you so sure that she can’t?”
0x125616c0a801fe95261b2389bb8ea108bd705844 svidrigaïlov screwed up his eyes and smiled mockingly.
0x17f06141d28f41a904f5b468ca8ebc6e624db83f “you are right, she doesn’t love me, but you can never be sure of what has passed between husband and wife or lover and mistress.
0x93ce199a7b35f55a625a5f292e0f4edb1c5521c4 there’s always a little corner which remains a secret to the world and is only known to those two.
0xe4c0d43b80296916c55550aedcab0d731e59b627 will you answer for it that avdotya romanovna regarded me with aversion?”
0xa3d63120480285a3697a44dc73d8c3690f65df10 “from some words you’ve dropped, i notice that you still have designs--and of course evil ones--on dounia and mean to carry them out promptly.”
0xe9f19c404b575dcca5cc8ab131ddd9d80d5c1cdf “what, have i dropped words like that?”
0xe78cccd1fd29ebd3cf44fa462536cc36629bac75 svidrigaïlov asked in naïve dismay, taking not the slightest notice of the epithet bestowed on his designs.
0xde8736ee857b682c0c45d2f44674c6d6d30a16fe “why, you are dropping them even now.
0xf199ee13d670cd7ba583a39ebe4304ee0e822ced why are you so frightened?
0x07f151d4f59081ba8a4e2b2f217fdaf994830d8f what are you so afraid of now?”
0x78cf76e99f07658add7189e23100aee5800bf1a1 “me--afraid?
0x508df57b870151a5d33296b9df7482d8052261f9 afraid of you?
0x338bea5c41d749e33be1f1e9f48d5016e46606d1 you have rather to be afraid of me, _cher ami_.
0x5dca3357a1f24fdd557b7ba2861adc42b91219fd but what nonsense.... i’ve drunk too much though, i see that.
0xdd4fbb5ee41494ffd427862b77fa47b99bd91ffc i was almost saying too much again.
0x3c6ebaebbc2672c12bcdb015ac869878dab47284 damn the wine!
0x3a987acf8cbc1028b7dbc86bd086831151899a2b hi!
0xc6cb4b3ece9201a78b8ba3240f63d1b59d58bcab there, water!”
0x771c640f93e53709a8478a1a9f6add594695f7c2 he snatched up the champagne bottle and flung it without ceremony out of the window.
0x55cff3a55d05daca2f4927add8545e339e474a39 philip brought the water.
0x558d3e982ae01c6055eb941de89b4631781179de “that’s all nonsense!”
0x70f4c1f8ef4fc69dbf990d2e0a1678f753532d71 said svidrigaïlov, wetting a towel and putting it to his head.
0xaaea2484e6c503bf9f8eb71c363bdbf5f438e43a “but i can answer you in one word and annihilate all your suspicions.
0x90b969bc9cc80246cb12c686c471e2d31f95f712 do you know that i am going to get married?”
0xe2dd7f741713081bcd78d161d10c2e850d3f9005 “you told me so before.”
0x83e44e83c26e004e1efab62026c97904f0cbda06 “did i?
0xfb09f7784f2a0051fd6e3325b15113aa454f0bea i’ve forgotten.
0x4db62abe9736ba833cf29ea29e8e503a15d5c41b but i couldn’t have told you so for certain for i had not even seen my betrothed; i only meant to.
0xa7019f8cfab5476c239ff984a4c9094d42a12d04 but now i really have a betrothed and it’s a settled thing, and if it weren’t that i have business that can’t be put off, i would have taken you to see them at once, for i should like to ask your advice.
0x25c79718431cf261ab7636cc63e95e6f5afd0e02 ach, hang it, only ten minutes left!
0x1a4471689f090616c01b18b308195fc2d5962959 see, look at the watch.
0xc506581595c3b5ef2a2db2d1561a3ae4312b25b7 but i must tell you, for it’s an interesting story, my marriage, in its own way.
0x466b0cd293c27ca7f75e68efe12d10c5e6c025cf where are you off to?
0xf0173382a3ae3e6411c47fd8444cd0143591522c going again?”
0x76a073e594a784045f211163d00e0f69e679b0fe “no, i’m not going away now.”
0x933ac23c40b5c89c3e5ddb30ba9de8e7facdac33 “not at all?
0xcca7845e8c4b0021cbc9c3c5e9f5a55cb0e1a986 we shall see.
0xb9d3588c14e185ed800c00d5c7590ae5a244c388 i’ll take you there, i’ll show you my betrothed, only not now.
0x65bb478adfbae34eabdc92fa348e4b887434f669 for you’ll soon have to be off.
0xaa46c67d6508f63c28a1f4b5559079c2a0c95f02 you have to go to the right and i to the left.
0x217ec4546364cf31a4532b70c85bf737247260db do you know that madame resslich, the woman i am lodging with now, eh?
0x1e8742fec178ded38779df25825cdfe00bf3d525 i know what you’re thinking, that she’s the woman whose girl they say drowned herself in the winter.
0x9c1a37ca044af1bcd63be9763b847b90208ee99e come, are you listening?
0x96b6f3c19092dfb0869cb33fcbaa87ba0f3a3fc9 she arranged it all for me.
0x2bba500961808b88fe049f4add6d592dab9f10c9 you’re bored, she said, you want something to fill up your time.
0xb29a13b716d37bcd38ca1331eb691427d710f940 for, you know, i am a gloomy, depressed person.
0xaae533998a074ffebeba2e4be5eb8d3f7987f2f5 do you think i’m light-hearted?
0x5bd65f5b339e4d861281f7a9560d1e75628e23c0 no, i’m gloomy.
0xc5bfc2768f8b930dbc331015efe6d09b676df058 i do no harm, but sit in a corner without speaking a word for three days at a time.
0x12a768a6f9d22d94c839ac68bfc87d313839f4cc and that resslich is a sly hussy, i tell you.
0xbad9198cdbdfe81dcd76bbfab87a9b99126cc5c3 i know what she has got in her mind; she thinks i shall get sick of it, abandon my wife and depart, and she’ll get hold of her and make a profit out of her--in our class, of course, or higher.
0xc447db47d328cf5c8af93f91401076c549d76fcd she told me the father was a broken-down retired official, who has been sitting in a chair for the last three years with his legs paralysed.
0x8b03c42282ffd0ecd951a2d2f5e2f7aa4360ec05 the mamma, she said, was a sensible woman.
0x6bc624c54f6cd58e955a3888da02f28bdaede0e6 there is a son serving in the provinces, but he doesn’t help; there is a daughter, who is married, but she doesn’t visit them.
0x82042dc46815bf3cb0eb8d2d20d9f2692390373e and they’ve two little nephews on their hands, as though their own children were not enough, and they’ve taken from school their youngest daughter, a girl who’ll be sixteen in another month, so that then she can be married.
0xfd0b67f1223eeb9d69bc39a32d649782026de037 she was for me.
0x5474ec970d1a4203e766a968a86185102be576a7 we went there.
0xc7abf2fc2be9eef977b0b901388f938653e1657e how funny it was!
0x1cd396a542b98d51b21789a2817e81eed1af643b i present myself--a landowner, a widower, of a well-known name, with connections, with a fortune.
0x28bbb1b6f3d05bd17fae855c9881435816c19a26 what if i am fifty and she is not sixteen?
0xac4100d24ac5a2df72db71480f5878a2a2ed1767 who thinks of that?
0x33d75a31b0cfb269fb7411af4cb0b7208f984959 but it’s fascinating, isn’t it?
0xb0812d86b581f7e8e7779f3ab696cd9a953d70c6 it is fascinating, ha-ha!
0x2e6dfc5fed499d0696a6aa2cf14e162c3656932b you should have seen how i talked to the papa and mamma.
0x6ea58616cab67851e2e5b816130e539c4d004727 it was worth paying to have seen me at that moment.
0x88ec1192e57e5bc505b39239428d6400b5f6d041 she comes in, curtseys, you can fancy, still in a short frock--an unopened bud!
0x9e9cda81e72667a3a6871fb364ea48fc853b4e86 flushing like a sunset--she had been told, no doubt.
0x8fffc4107c5521c52a7a79b478c5315284ed3382 i don’t know how you feel about female faces, but to my mind these sixteen years, these childish eyes, shyness and tears of bashfulness are better than beauty; and she is a perfect little picture, too.
0x356761544d8630c15fc67ae573aece7c81ee4e30 fair hair in little curls, like a lamb’s, full little rosy lips, tiny feet, a charmer!... well, we made friends.
0x39b62afd88a6a20cf152bc06b309aea62cded49d i told them i was in a hurry owing to domestic circumstances, and the next day, that is the day before yesterday, we were betrothed.
0xe3a13431b6fada12c1232d64e9f327e5a536587f when i go now i take her on my knee at once and keep her there.... well, she flushes like a sunset and i kiss her every minute.
0x2febe7dee70eda105d59f1de7f0e9257b80e88cd her mamma of course impresses on her that this is her husband and that this must be so.
0xf999d584c163d3abc35334fac22321a8a5a034cf it’s simply delicious!
0xccbd6832a85371df4722cbf753e2570b1afd1276 the present betrothed condition is perhaps better than marriage.
0x4550641859df2770b9aa92c2704e2c1b51086e17 here you have what is called _la nature et la vérité_, ha-ha!
0xf7b1e3e8a886b20e5e4791b667a5f3d0c640c4fa i’ve talked to her twice, she is far from a fool.
0x5be80d330f81f87b03698b3b94cc53d24a3b56e7 sometimes she steals a look at me that positively scorches me.
0xbc8bb6f39cba4eb371a842dda85b286c412a468c her face is like raphael’s madonna.
0x606eb31ba2a7d256839c3e3d60a4fff5bf792ec1 you know, the sistine madonna’s face has something fantastic in it, the face of mournful religious ecstasy.
0x207a12d98dd8946cf97bbb867b09617303bb6c8b haven’t you noticed it?
0x9852591b2ab4faac5f39a069a4cdc823662e56e2 well, she’s something in that line.
0x89161fbc75fa8f5c93d389683e13ee500303c602 the day after we’d been betrothed, i bought her presents to the value of fifteen hundred roubles--a set of diamonds and another of pearls and a silver dressing-case as large as this, with all sorts of things in it, so that even my madonna’s face glowed.
0x3091b72299fec3966d329238ccdc94a8728aff01 i sat her on my knee, yesterday, and i suppose rather too unceremoniously--she flushed crimson and the tears started, but she didn’t want to show it.
0xcb77015f995ecfe0056f151ea9565fd65e8dde93 we were left alone, she suddenly flung herself on my neck (for the first time of her own accord), put her little arms round me, kissed me, and vowed that she would be an obedient, faithful, and good wife, would make me happy, would devote all her life, every minute of her life, would sacrifice everything, everything, and that all she asks in return is my _respect_, and that she wants ‘nothing, nothing more from me, no presents.’
0xd4de8fd2365b53f5796879050fcc19134f6ba661 you’ll admit that to hear such a confession, alone, from an angel of sixteen in a muslin frock, with little curls, with a flush of maiden shyness in her cheeks and tears of enthusiasm in her eyes is rather fascinating!
0x6eeaf55c62c2e9d0dccac4df2d7c768cc15f1de6 isn’t it fascinating?
0xa875c08c153a292230315d24f7d09b2ed1d57515 it’s worth paying for, isn’t it?
0xdd2c6afba65ada1675e5e5c1ba7ad1047dda655d well... listen, we’ll go to see my betrothed, only not just now!”
0x9114d5b2b79332004fd1cf4524c28ee6f46f370d “the fact is this monstrous difference in age and development excites your sensuality!
0xa71c126bb0156007d36e97b66f26a36af466657c will you really make such a marriage?”
0x4f481fc964249f109a72d8c3caa48d298093d8c1 “why, of course.
0x67a425e748ece99a5ff469b9a85527539864c80d everyone thinks of himself, and he lives most gaily who knows best how to deceive himself.

0xce44b561d86827b8f3ff00053e5ecc7fed5f64d6 but why are you so keen about virtue?

0x2f3b14b858138b8e842ae009a62cf7de0e221fa9 “but you have provided for the children of katerina ivanovna.
0x14f3187f27b349846de6bb705c88b15eb8e96045 though... though you had your own reasons.... i understand it all now.”
0x6bc3d5facb7d8bbe2a0f5f08f93cd17c3db3afaa “i am always fond of children, very fond of them,” laughed svidrigaïlov.
0x387eefe4c3c60b6a2a569bd4604d10789e67e794 “i can tell you one curious instance of it.
0x3bbf45015c4be8fae8535ca61206a9df7d6387b7 the first day i came here i visited various haunts, after seven years i simply rushed at them.
0xe70d1559bcfa396987dfabd6526bcd586bfe90d4 you probably notice that i am not in a hurry to renew acquaintance with my old friends.
0xd45d98db1c8f8637a4e9d84aa4280b75fea23deb i shall do without them as long as i can.
0x3625ff2acd2480ab1ff5f9adf73927825093077a do you know, when i was with marfa petrovna in the country, i was haunted by the thought of these places where anyone who knows his way about can find a great deal.
0x53833a290bf0bc4424d89bcd323c24904a483e80 yes, upon my soul!
0xb9dd578c5f8fdd097f48e496baa34acc808b1fa0 the peasants have vodka, the educated young people, shut out from activity, waste themselves in impossible dreams and visions and are crippled by theories; jews have sprung up and are amassing money, and all the rest give themselves up to debauchery.
0xcd7b25b4ee3b039c4579c88fae3d6e74d3e670dd from the first hour the town reeked of its familiar odours.
0xb65aa445f3a7686a890b42c1ccf163c3eacf8ea0 i chanced to be in a frightful den--i like my dens dirty--it was a dance, so called, and there was a _cancan_ such as i never saw in my day.
0xe9096d57477746c51e5cf744b3e5130b539fc1fe yes, there you have progress.
0x37e9495852d9d87e9e781a462e532fd417f97a07 all of a sudden i saw a little girl of thirteen, nicely dressed, dancing with a specialist in that line, with another one _vis-à-vis_.
0x7d45ba3bf0d57389d3ab61d5a1c1efaec0337a72 her mother was sitting on a chair by the wall.
0x8373daac2956eb81278a4a7c03167a0d57454673 you can’t fancy what a _cancan_ that was!
0xcdab0866828eb8cd0331479399caed98f802221f the girl was ashamed, blushed, at last felt insulted, and began to cry.
0x46c0023727dec1d28db43dc77db7b4840ab9227f her partner seized her and began whirling her round and performing before her; everyone laughed and--i like your public, even the _cancan_ public--they laughed and shouted, ‘serves her right--serves her right!
0x51d0d99069d0d9e14b63641d32b83214ebcdea40 shouldn’t bring children!’
0xb4e9148b7cd6d09e4be14643a7fd6ff8b399a548 well, it’s not my business whether that consoling reflection was logical or not.
0xa76fe86c22f4278b0c095e5e0adc3e36fc1802fd i at once fixed on my plan, sat down by the mother, and began by saying that i too was a stranger and that people here were ill-bred and that they couldn’t distinguish decent folks and treat them with respect, gave her to understand that i had plenty of money, offered to take them home in my carriage.
0x40d48556a4ac970c82747b9566efba6141da79e9 i took them home and got to know them.
0x685fc3cb65bcabc42b9df103032c72d790151a91 they were lodging in a miserable little hole and had only just arrived from the country.
0x06b5939ae7e15474b2444081f67229718b8757c6 she told me that she and her daughter could only regard my acquaintance as an honour.
0xec2f9bffbfa25c08df6b10a04b930a8895cb772d i found out that they had nothing of their own and had come to town upon some legal business.
0x067b830d60d49a812cc67bfb044d67f0af6f3069 i proffered my services and money.
0x5495d9541bde885dbae0d1f0ff7a3b57bc1b61b7 i learnt that they had gone to the dancing saloon by mistake, believing that it was a genuine dancing class.
0x2daf6b478a2ab4024b638f28885cf6eee58747be i offered to assist in the young girl’s education in french and dancing.
0xb6894725c2b7f1db4f79cbbf68a188a9329c7fba my offer was accepted with enthusiasm as an honour--and we are still friendly.... if you like, we’ll go and see them, only not just now.”
0x0760162130cea67dde385bf3436e628bf6575b05 “stop!

0xc39265f29a070bc3f97a20b8d84e6ba828bf7a1b i can see i am ridiculous myself,” muttered raskolnikov angrily.
0x5fa7ab50c91349d36b191b8fcf387a748d6f22bc svidrigaïlov laughed heartily; finally he called philip, paid his bill, and began getting up.
0xfb9ad48c6fb338131ef6d5ad9682565fc2642c62 “i say, but i am drunk, _assez causé_,” he said.
0x3980e3bda60af101679b3365282493a87da5c32b “it’s been a pleasure.”
0xe0ea8c3d8691fa24376033af0d2a93ee1c06a769 “i should rather think it must be a pleasure!”
0x331c705800d34796dc529ee393ba2983ea79b70c cried raskolnikov, getting up.
0x5b59fcf4b2c30a4b000ced4a42f4a810262cbcdb “no doubt it is a pleasure for a worn-out profligate to describe such adventures with a monstrous project of the same sort in his mind--especially under such circumstances and to such a man as me.... it’s stimulating!”
0x4b443189697d77f4d5061a40a8b3af75b030fcfd “well, if you come to that,” svidrigaïlov answered, scrutinising raskolnikov with some surprise, “if you come to that, you are a thorough cynic yourself.
0xef896b88e75474963111013c61ba3931f44ee346 you’ve plenty to make you so, anyway.

0x7cc92233a6d3407f01b7c71af1e0507c497040f4 svidrigaïlov walked out of the restaurant.
0xbc386ad2a10acdceb97767b4b97d0f58a5a0cc77 raskolnikov walked out after him.
0x848a61b4b6c0fabb2b3257736d7cb68a1018f98e svidrigaïlov was not however very drunk, the wine had affected him for a moment, but it was passing off every minute.
0x66e703a64514ff31e17e77f7a6b4f3daf7b07026 he was preoccupied with something of importance and was frowning.
0xc0d81a0d7aa09d19a4f799195814c917877004d5 he was apparently excited and uneasy in anticipation of something.
0x150a143b0bf8a7e9db4965e66437153c4c2e3092 his manner to raskolnikov had changed during the last few minutes, and he was ruder and more sneering every moment.
0xae068b57a65f61b8603c1e187730883b4a3bfc9e raskolnikov noticed all this, and he too was uneasy.
0x3a16b4eaefb7a68af90c0ef4eea594e3bfcff771 he became very suspicious of svidrigaïlov and resolved to follow him.
0x39eccbeb122ffc1d894e8e0dcacd4c92c163784a they came out on to the pavement.
0xa0bdd8a08582107eaef68f51394a8b6ae66a1783 “you go to the right, and i to the left, or if you like, the other way.

0x71767010f630faa449ac3341b0ddc01eb6efbc9d and he walked to the right towards the hay market.

0x77e5bff09d30f96e95a00322fa3018a9ae4d9add “what’s this?”
0xdca1f2108aea3558e45165c7b5d4d2eb1180a1c2 cried svidrigaïlov turning round, “i thought i said...” “it means that i am not going to lose sight of you now.”
0xe289aec3e0f10cf03bf5f5877dd53b83ef42d86f “what?”
0x3002c489efbc6f317a7acd063f80250b4fec39e0 both stood still and gazed at one another, as though measuring their strength.
0x6b8f3b02611957e403006618b3e5ae0fe96d8068 “from all your half tipsy stories,” raskolnikov observed harshly, “i am _positive_ that you have not given up your designs on my sister, but are pursuing them more actively than ever.

0xf09a3ef996ac904547978a007d18172fe868717f i should like to make certain myself.”
0xb1277f14cb36e7ece8ff0a8c000ac0e2a040238b raskolnikov could hardly have said himself what he wanted and of what he wished to make certain.
0xe12585385c9fcca66feef2d6a545a75ca476b6c3 “upon my word!

0xd3ec6f607d610776f716f39961f5c1cb3ec7348b “call away!”
0xd571379a2017564a0b769a86c095e0f8cb9f3576 again they stood for a minute facing each other.
0xb073601230b013f0209a1d3c9cd6c5b26529b765 at last svidrigaïlov’s face changed.
0xb9051db6e6fcc36c5c30cc5d4e93563241f527c9 having satisfied himself that raskolnikov was not frightened at his threat, he assumed a mirthful and friendly air.

0xe2baab10ed3a125b70814cd9601e685d96aaa947 i purposely refrained from referring to your affair, though i am devoured by curiosity.

0x97746a602bf41f01139e15cf466103c6a229c350 “i’m coming to your lodgings, not to see you but sofya semyonovna, to say i’m sorry not to have been at the funeral.”

0x71fe21036ada428eff1e80817176322be93ac8e1 it struck you as extraordinary; i don’t mind betting it’s that.

0x9e4258815ee0f94bfdbe4b2d141180e9d30db0a2 the bureau is locked, the flat is locked, and here we are again on the stairs.

0xc7603aa7cb402515c7bf2ef679ff5e55c2b6ef83 never mind, we’ll put down the hood....” svidrigaïlov was already in the carriage.
0xaa7a5390b3edc790b999cdbe3733df6f22da9215 raskolnikov decided that his suspicions were at least for that moment unjust.
0xc3e453b4d5364462eef786473555be301d93e693 without answering a word he turned and walked back towards the hay market.
0xf506231f1576dab785513d12eee419eda9851aee if he had only turned round on his way he might have seen svidrigaïlov get out not a hundred paces off, dismiss the cab and walk along the pavement.
0xe4e5320044b5b85e6190a34347400d9df36f9f06 but he had turned the corner and could see nothing.
0x22464019c4fcecf7faf46c5b1fe95a0cb758e837 intense disgust drew him away from svidrigaïlov.
0x287782c43e6c1cf8f6d0c0938f5317a7d293438c “to think that i could for one instant have looked for help from that coarse brute, that depraved sensualist and blackguard!”
0x6be4a61b9ed32ac9464aa8dfb8a9d0a99d485621 he cried.
0xa72bf8983cd3d5c8a7a4ff3de134f92703e9f50a raskolnikov’s judgment was uttered too lightly and hastily: there was something about svidrigaïlov which gave him a certain original, even a mysterious character.
0x16ce7d4d27801a80f502a9da06c1a9a3547f2433 as concerned his sister, raskolnikov was convinced that svidrigaïlov would not leave her in peace.
0x114723385c6b64f1be77339c15201f22f2d4f60c but it was too tiresome and unbearable to go on thinking and thinking about this.
0x35c66ffb8b5ce0d773424639cddfe828bd5c0ece when he was alone, he had not gone twenty paces before he sank, as usual, into deep thought.
0x0f296d21d08b9103e646e5e16fe5a68861a4c331 on the bridge he stood by the railing and began gazing at the water.
0x4a8198f62df012f76cabc6049b26c9936cf26556 and his sister was standing close by him.
0x4ffae2e8784a8f1d86dc533a96fe09803808aa3e he met her at the entrance to the bridge, but passed by without seeing her.
0x681b36c48b627c87d8372d9712d25fe9571cf829 dounia had never met him like this in the street before and was struck with dismay.
0x81f7b6c35affb1de2971c8be8f05be021dbebae9 she stood still and did not know whether to call to him or not.
0x757c2e29b5d26a3705e0b7a170a67e91fde55693 suddenly she saw svidrigaïlov coming quickly from the direction of the hay market.
0xf9786397e222d5d84e0bfbdd8759e0a443a4c9ff he seemed to be approaching cautiously.
0xc86e2434de621669b97345db11d056d5938deade he did not go on to the bridge, but stood aside on the pavement, doing all he could to avoid raskolnikov’s seeing him.
0x25616f9d39c57eef71b95caf6644f15969f05f9f he had observed dounia for some time and had been making signs to her.
0x8375f2da56f18688afe97ccc55f60fd10b5d1e13 she fancied he was signalling to beg her not to speak to her brother, but to come to him.
0xd79b4c572b456bc5a3ee50a96aaac8ff7cbd4d55 that was what dounia did.
0xbd19e7ce80a346a41562c301cd99e3a255b369d8 she stole by her brother and went up to svidrigaïlov.
0xf480796292deaed329df0b242fae9baa33022aae “let us make haste away,” svidrigaïlov whispered to her, “i don’t want rodion romanovitch to know of our meeting.
0x2301abb9c83466dc24f76164583d86133c3a7b2e i must tell you i’ve been sitting with him in the restaurant close by, where he looked me up and i had great difficulty in getting rid of him.
0xdd855954ac58dfe584d9b832f624cf0a967c4645 he has somehow heard of my letter to you and suspects something.
0x7f20d443579c87f25a9a422f58e23fc29ccbca4d it wasn’t you who told him, of course, but if not you, who then?”
0x10c8367e1b19a271779f5abbe31212e273fbb56e “well, we’ve turned the corner now,” dounia interrupted, “and my brother won’t see us.
0x8fe810d60de596e20cd5e2e5e2a7b40dd70d426c i have to tell you that i am going no further with you.
0xb5bf6049dbcade1169cc9067ff31626cbbb0ea2a speak to me here.
0x2d8c2d87c624c6775191e1cf87792e2acd34bd42 you can tell it all in the street.”
0xdf1843f1cd323f72869543664e616d98de82e1b8 “in the first place, i can’t say it in the street; secondly, you must hear sofya semyonovna too; and, thirdly, i will show you some papers.... oh well, if you won’t agree to come with me, i shall refuse to give any explanation and go away at once.
0x1f2e0de6482a5f78ca6edc13071c298825dcf48b but i beg you not to forget that a very curious secret of your beloved brother’s is entirely in my keeping.”
0x8cdf8b6f52ac0743c0013a68de11c74a3a309a69 dounia stood still, hesitating, and looked at svidrigaïlov with searching eyes.
0x15db18a9ae833cd863bf676b158a8b3e2b64140c “what are you afraid of?”
0x25a1981317b34cac17740bd837745d06b38e7e07 he observed quietly.
0xcc0f2a5f2e470037066cb29a8928c78b20ed9c75 “the town is not the country.
0xb4dc58c380b2e8b7145b1854cb5182f0c784e322 and even in the country you did me more harm than i did you.”
0xc1800410df4c3dcd4e54e8179b3f79422284abed “have you prepared sofya semyonovna?”
0x43bf2e3f445f6a67fa78e2b80e0cc503124bddc3 “no, i have not said a word to her and am not quite certain whether she is at home now.
0x70eb4d423428592468c9c19202545335d14fe958 but most likely she is.
0x7c554463d724cdd7b09e7bc9f9e4061e42d5e143 she has buried her stepmother to-day: she is not likely to go visiting on such a day.
0xf87f72e7359b840560f34ce6a6783248fb86a4fa for the time i don’t want to speak to anyone about it and i half regret having spoken to you.
0xffb4f3f0bef668cb57943c047b8fe905fc3672c4 the slightest indiscretion is as bad as betrayal in a thing like this.
0x2adb50109c278b3ffe4150bb395ea696e8b05a71 i live there in that house, we are coming to it.
0xd0448b14527712d9e890f88f4d42fe0c31a7dcfa that’s the porter of our house--he knows me very well; you see, he’s bowing; he sees i’m coming with a lady and no doubt he has noticed your face already and you will be glad of that if you are afraid of me and suspicious.
0x19c31541c230ac7c9eae3c261b5f339146a72049 excuse my putting things so coarsely.
0x55a548420a715d63a37ec700b0d3413061deec77 i haven’t a flat to myself; sofya semyonovna’s room is next to mine--she lodges in the next flat.
0x013837acc1889a2ab44bd6ed10957a22cca43738 the whole floor is let out in lodgings.
0xbad88de8e8c725413514e79016ee4404eeb1500d why are you frightened like a child?
0x87a63489899f9c955575e0641095662524e3ae6d am i really so terrible?”
0x78c9417b0a3db8ece49683b26229bab37f00b7ee svidrigaïlov’s lips were twisted in a condescending smile; but he was in no smiling mood.
0xbdbe0c135c76f25ceec130ceca9bc5886c1dcd13 his heart was throbbing and he could scarcely breathe.
0xb5e060665a07b1c9efa1e70e6808aacbc7953f44 he spoke rather loud to cover his growing excitement.
0xdad5fe3e866910febaed4535d3a8299dc839f003 but dounia did not notice this peculiar excitement, she was so irritated by his remark that she was frightened of him like a child and that he was so terrible to her.
0x13c07ac70313d2fb4993b9c6493ac0f6bbe312e3 “though i know that you are not a man... of honour, i am not in the least afraid of you.
0x41ce79147041c0ad1bf5475d6584ed9e06d34268 lead the way,” she said with apparent composure, but her face was very pale.
0x27d07eb1641365c9bec2eb142f8c92ac73491acb svidrigaïlov stopped at sonia’s room.
0x54db7d458e69ee6fa0635fbd6d6a0788ab869ed9 “allow me to inquire whether she is at home.... she is not.
0xda2006aa375de536c742e53497b199f0805338e7 how unfortunate!
0x8073bc760f54eaab1fe64ad6b54215341ea41312 but i know she may come quite soon.
0x6e31dcb5caa03dfb446485a308ee4f8bde159589 if she’s gone out, it can only be to see a lady about the orphans.
0x015ed41e7e647991c8c2d0519b167ab995ac4085 their mother is dead.... i’ve been meddling and making arrangements for them.
0xfaa47e697ac80e669c4a0aca8c3346abe04454a3 if sofya semyonovna does not come back in ten minutes, i will send her to you, to-day if you like.
0x8159fa7934467f7367e63bf1d5de8ded9e6b7dba this is my flat.
0x46fbc4e554403533ad18f9a0d1ced3033bad8ada these are my two rooms.

0x6eb6649b689c221b5a2835459d5e9b8e58ce86d0 i will show you my chief piece of evidence: this door from my bedroom leads into two perfectly empty rooms, which are to let.
0xca68dc57cb0da2a22610bb4909bbe73b75ef3ed6 here they are... you must look into them with some attention.”
0x8f40b73ed6af9e96a2aa219acde48f6adbed138c svidrigaïlov occupied two fairly large furnished rooms.
0x92537d80e23f58191cd3eabf1982dcc9837d4535 dounia was looking about her mistrustfully, but saw nothing special in the furniture or position of the rooms.
0x316c1aa7c961bc6dfa580f689a0d44c32f011b4b yet there was something to observe, for instance, that svidrigaïlov’s flat was exactly between two sets of almost uninhabited apartments.
0xe8bacf3328197c8a40f79bff12f1f28012d42187 his rooms were not entered directly from the passage, but through the landlady’s two almost empty rooms.
0x906d985dab60b97c3547604e7ab2d1bb4f242b06 unlocking a door leading out of his bedroom, svidrigaïlov showed dounia the two empty rooms that were to let.
0x32d01e78a81eac0b993dcf467ed4920c13654c16 dounia stopped in the doorway, not knowing what she was called to look upon, but svidrigaïlov hastened to explain.
0xa8696b8f854f7c2a728783c8a80aebc51f2d7c13 “look here, at this second large room.
0x6778672c2df05d1c18481072df9790ebb46b42b1 notice that door, it’s locked.
0x5b18fc84646429669397df990351fe82d3bac2ac by the door stands a chair, the only one in the two rooms.
0x08b1a910d615e1c73445cbde1368dba10e56bb26 i brought it from my rooms so as to listen more conveniently.
0x0c45296cf69b940c8d8d73c1add1a9c0bb2115d7 just the other side of the door is sofya semyonovna’s table; she sat there talking to rodion romanovitch.
0xb559dcf3c7ce8783b570d40271e0d5f8bdf5e894 and i sat here listening on two successive evenings, for two hours each time--and of course i was able to learn something, what do you think?”
0x378c20f8e60405d033b79355552328439556bbdc “you listened?”
0xebbc5c5a076890d8f43591e97254175813468abb “yes, i did.
0xfe5b7237e41945551d3319d5df9f311e1b311cd8 now come back to my room; we can’t sit down here.”
0x869afe074518f97b542c9232581f2cb24b66be94 he brought avdotya romanovna back into his sitting-room and offered her a chair.
0x9f14d359061a57a1e51dc0d62db43d8c83c66cc2 he sat down at the opposite side of the table, at least seven feet from her, but probably there was the same glow in his eyes which had once frightened dounia so much.
0x92fd3f597ce4474bb26c50b2fe21beb6ab66a147 she shuddered and once more looked about her distrustfully.
0x0c134dcb6a21a3403db599f8b7534f76ec53f89f it was an involuntary gesture; she evidently did not wish to betray her uneasiness.
0xe9fadd1bf67277df753ae5dcc2f6ffb537c8c9c0 but the secluded position of svidrigaïlov’s lodging had suddenly struck her.
0x9d13025766d0c11e185b9148047cf4a9b70e82e9 she wanted to ask whether his landlady at least were at home, but pride kept her from asking.
0xa398c41fe1374ccbb08ae1de04d147f832adeaf2 moreover, she had another trouble in her heart incomparably greater than fear for herself.
0xdc669a3ae03bb8df8488f676a5c21097d7681c0a she was in great distress.
0xe2adfeb06036c06253e0bff37c0894801a88b6d4 “here is your letter,” she said, laying it on the table.
0x6b40a694eecd870c028fdb60fb507f026c51867f “can it be true what you write?
0x280154108c981965ec42683099c8d8a4fddfb6f8 you hint at a crime committed, you say, by my brother.
0xdf3b205a60201adb574e4b2ff9a4c562c198a29b you hint at it too clearly; you daren’t deny it now.
0x2220342a4e4f01350e47dba6af5dccba14f09a08 i must tell you that i’d heard of this stupid story before you wrote and don’t believe a word of it.
0x0456324b1cd5c90a2608349c084df5d55503f979 it’s a disgusting and ridiculous suspicion.

0x488b0b3176cb5b2b17366784239e92d93c0e8816 you can have no proofs.

0xfb61e54c3ae75b2da292a6e1a2fd86a1e81587e8 dounia said this, speaking hurriedly, and for an instant the colour rushed to her face.

0x849329b63906a96ca63b0be96114d8b9cbf17477 he made a full confession to her.
0xbee2a26d654d10b58ff7e9670594dc9bd8e249d1 he is a murderer.
0xd7416787d2c1a63d6efabb42513c3763027a8973 he killed an old woman, a pawnbroker, with whom he had pawned things himself.
0xf3cd480393b45c8d9e67e3ad385040f349158807 he killed her sister too, a pedlar woman called lizaveta, who happened to come in while he was murdering her sister.
0x5f29a1d695ef9c3a759748c385c0263e84049dd7 he killed them with an axe he brought with him.
0xe9868693c2e48f5c97e50566c646717934a576e2 he murdered them to rob them and he did rob them.
0x8054141fecaeaed5076ff7a01ad83a2f128fecf3 he took money and various things.... he told all this, word for word, to sofya semyonovna, the only person who knows his secret.
0x0b95bf387c99e90f4003f45cd4c2015fde4f31b9 but she has had no share by word or deed in the murder; she was as horrified at it as you are now.

0x900fa5ff7012b43574f52aaf2e7a81d8dcd3ab16 “it cannot be,” muttered dounia, with white lips.
0x5c9a4cb632a3aabe6e8cbb8d50f6bd3690a8f8c3 she gasped for breath.

0x5b79d221dddbeec07d5c7dfbbbc0d5589959d624 cried dounia, and she jumped up from the chair.
0x6da9d9d3361d560a6407a81a57ab186726c0f987 “why, you know him, and you’ve seen him, can he be a thief?”
0xbf7b2813471836eef2384c3bb99af9355c72a6f8 she seemed to be imploring svidrigaïlov; she had entirely forgotten her fear.

0xf433e71b164fb29f212ccba3d466bba33ef752ef he explained all the causes of it to sofya semyonovna too, but she did not believe her ears at first, yet she believed her own eyes at last.”
0x17ffbcf6367539347396da7f3193c6358f6f8630 “what... were the causes?”
0x4ee08b520772e352c08a2a4f7fef50e0f5e53cd9 “it’s a long story, avdotya romanovna.
0x6e71496fd1bcb6604931d1e6ad802f9ad7146c38 here’s... how shall i tell you?--a theory of a sort, the same one by which i for instance consider that a single misdeed is permissible if the principal aim is right, a solitary wrongdoing and hundreds of good deeds!
0x74d6b4eb94b8960b905a5260363f1e6ed19590cb it’s galling too, of course, for a young man of gifts and overweening pride to know that if he had, for instance, a paltry three thousand, his whole career, his whole future would be differently shaped and yet not to have that three thousand.
0xa6f292a5dd79380e05dd6e8c4d77e002e14670c8 add to that, nervous irritability from hunger, from lodging in a hole, from rags, from a vivid sense of the charm of his social position and his sister’s and mother’s position too.

0x5e38e31a80150affa7178ee7b9e1a4dd9541f992 a special little theory came in too--a theory of a sort--dividing mankind, you see, into material and superior persons, that is persons to whom the law does not apply owing to their superiority, who make laws for the rest of mankind, the material, that is.
0xf283a9028e217c342b247d6f0897598f0f44d95b it’s all right as a theory, _une théorie comme une autre_.

0xbc862e102598887d060fe702df71bda9a37dd2cb he has suffered a great deal and is still suffering from the idea that he could make a theory, but was incapable of boldly overstepping the law, and so he is not a man of genius.
0x53bdad8693e9431e1e8d0f44dd3be8513072a0ef and that’s humiliating for a young man of any pride, in our day especially....” “but remorse?
0x6722d1ab5a2b652210c1deaac9594cae6bdb2390 you deny him any moral feeling then?

0x3115e42770485538bd4edf412956356c9b27f85f “ah, avdotya romanovna, everything is in a muddle now; not that it was ever in very good order.
0x2e67dad2eb2739c81f319e2e38959c68520e7e96 russians in general are broad in their ideas, avdotya romanovna, broad like their land and exceedingly disposed to the fantastic, the chaotic.
0x129e18d9ba701a25c296347b4650d3175e810b56 but it’s a misfortune to be broad without a special genius.

0xf6ec8a935711e7fd965b4ee3ecf99519f6145b94 do you know that you are killing me?...”
0xb898115a27464d3484a3ebba3476f88ccf0c9f92 he was almost beginning to rave.... something seemed suddenly to go to his head.
0xfc1cc8e0b473393897f78989281d8147a0b2a199 dounia jumped up and rushed to the door.
0x9fb6dbae5c0016fdc0ecbf5ee50e72f2235a7c77 “open it!
0x1891bcd9f278c60ba63cc9f2b56c64744f8080bb open it!”
0x9dfece3bc338f90138e3a7fd753fe287b38e01fd she called, shaking the door.
0x9fb6dbae5c0016fdc0ecbf5ee50e72f2235a7c77 “open it!
0xb41644e7e9f012bcea50c1f4b57497988404bb84 is there no one there?”
0xbdb439c918ab5cdec674c013a88076d4d5e8052b svidrigaïlov got up and came to himself.
0xea9e7c8fa765763a3c1c42657cecd4116b675cc3 his still trembling lips slowly broke into an angry mocking smile.
0x639997e95f402c21cb4f54d2e00b205fd3e276e5 “there is no one at home,” he said quietly and emphatically.
0xe1a49050a2976892c04178f214c8819e8625130c “the landlady has gone out, and it’s waste of time to shout like that.
0x32f8e918bc9aac4dce89ed13a13bd1cb6ea1b991 you are only exciting yourself uselessly.”
0x9332a5722831b33089ff6eea368e51ad9e8e5db6 “where is the key?
0xc3fe43258b1f4c7f4f16212358e8339242b2b075 open the door at once, at once, base man!”
0xd1359c354dac109bca0abd7b202b69c150e6a79b “i have lost the key and cannot find it.”
0x4b8bb2fb107221c86a3c8e7062c982064187ee4b “this is an outrage,” cried dounia, turning pale as death.
0xaa123085f27633c87def95196ca7caa5d096bfce she rushed to the furthest corner, where she made haste to barricade herself with a little table.
0x89891626dceee123d1e47f0d405de6910d5e34a5 she did not scream, but she fixed her eyes on her tormentor and watched every movement he made.
0x4d4b192c3174042764a5165634d7ed202267077e svidrigaïlov remained standing at the other end of the room facing her.
0xa112ad57841e98601aca501cbcc216505be29bc6 he was positively composed, at least in appearance, but his face was pale as before.
0xd580ee95baab18c862d1c55c92600cd9cbe3e5ad the mocking smile did not leave his face.
0xe7bdd9f0217f22baaaefd55b91955e1aed4525dd “you spoke of outrage just now, avdotya romanovna.
0x1288aed36bfdc5995e65e4e80953801803d2fc2a in that case you may be sure i’ve taken measures.
0x49f0b624a5b89ec2b95bb9ad50d482958c7cf4dd sofya semyonovna is not at home.
0xe246d35b582330338be48f3bb354720f58ade2d1 the kapernaumovs are far away--there are five locked rooms between.
0x9617eca6115b5a404aefeb361f100f386d2f4fe5 i am at least twice as strong as you are and i have nothing to fear, besides.
0xd5f889664315cc979df4bdb34b95ead20a75775b for you could not complain afterwards.
0xf7a8cd5ebb6de027314af49dfc5e791d07bd2f57 you surely would not be willing actually to betray your brother?
0xe87f459570ad961c116715321327fceb27a88161 besides, no one would believe you.
0x3e04028ca16515eea148de1fe38334830e7e2c51 how should a girl have come alone to visit a solitary man in his lodgings?
0x8e32d1ac04a332bf4e02753a13833297392f2d1a so that even if you do sacrifice your brother, you could prove nothing.
0x45e5208f3e62a3200afc7a31a78ee0770138b3ed it is very difficult to prove an assault, avdotya romanovna.”
0xb2b6ee325d38ab79538bf261fdfc4c591ba69953 “scoundrel!”
0x5fb48d8fbfc8e959bc08ab1534fbdd2f84a9465a whispered dounia indignantly.
0xef4ddc084279b1572fe551a6438724a5dcbdebe4 “as you like, but observe i was only speaking by way of a general proposition.
0x7513e9ae8493a402ec9fec37f66ed8bc36bb3b76 it’s my personal conviction that you are perfectly right--violence is hateful.
0x6e8d1ada3489be587782b1fdec9e7547c3e95922 i only spoke to show you that you need have no remorse even if... you were willing to save your brother of your own accord, as i suggest to you.
0x5dcbc680fd4b62322dcb4fc85aaf581fb29ff8f1 you would be simply submitting to circumstances, to violence, in fact, if we must use that word.
0xe465606619323b420c619ea7afc7ab3aec3cea63 think about it.
0xb3d856d80313d85866b38005f2119c33e8e14e2a your brother’s and your mother’s fate are in your hands.
0x036bbf6c45f6698a78478ea511d7ca79ca28e617 i will be your slave... all my life... i will wait here.”
0x7850617bad99a46a02e82b6d2c372e0bd9397318 svidrigaïlov sat down on the sofa about eight steps from dounia.
0xd858b684d48af56893f705e17bd8ddd602308587 she had not the slightest doubt now of his unbending determination.
0x5dc9bf235dc3d0626796f980688979401e5ccef6 besides, she knew him.
0x9437ca0cd40f568848163e0fb6db9142486b794b suddenly she pulled out of her pocket a revolver, cocked it and laid it in her hand on the table.
0x0107712614c58a4949bc64e9f8951a5b5b4ab1b4 svidrigaïlov jumped up.
0xb99434b084f38a12fc7caf419f4da437c77b21c2 “aha!
0xa463a2b0c78805dffb82159f5cedd0109fb98210 so that’s it, is it?”
0x5bbdc4217fb88b6c984d2fe4446779c61ca9b54a he cried, surprised but smiling maliciously.
0x0dcff72cf5f6d768c303d2fd6c25f3dc0d6646c7 “well, that completely alters the aspect of affairs.
0x878a438324af9391f13489d23b804c6d0120cf5d you’ve made things wonderfully easier for me, avdotya romanovna.
0x8f22b3b67c6b10e1fcf85fdb91f8be8459d82ab9 but where did you get the revolver?
0x07579e4068ff634bc3109e65fda4a5188fcc3d87 was it mr. razumihin?
0xd92e841013c87b46c19b65735688d921c4e9dcf4 why, it’s my revolver, an old friend!
0x5ccf90ba7235a31a2931773b490ec8cecb8ab8e1 and how i’ve hunted for it!
0x161058da3b0f85a2910186ac0ca5425e106de2c4 the shooting lessons i’ve given you in the country have not been thrown away.”
0xd56a6ccaa7e5a6837122acde277b2316daada5b7 “it’s not your revolver, it belonged to marfa petrovna, whom you killed, wretch!
0xd951942f13f2515b972e4bac1a8e40a19a732753 there was nothing of yours in her house.
0x1af2a052fedd470703ca74657bbd1f3608dbba5a i took it when i began to suspect what you were capable of.
0x8d8150bd62261e7b7317dcbff9f2a6ccd1e7865c if you dare to advance one step, i swear i’ll kill you.”
0x2f5b9c4a8f528fc5ab7ed0b52b1cb727c5cae840 she was frantic.
0x4ec4229eaa62a109d5042319c8af280951cddb89 “but your brother?
0x40ace757cc8c784385c5f73c48e7303156ea31dd i ask from curiosity,” said svidrigaïlov, still standing where he was.
0x2848edb2bdc4fef580254fa0851a961f9f3677d5 “inform, if you want to!
0x7522ed801b6cadc9ffb2db194aa64b388ff08819 don’t stir!
0x2d170253a7fb477043c45fdf17fadfb0316413d0 don’t come nearer!
0xe9b24b8950db8dd5219e350eac463b837b159e11 i’ll shoot!
0x6ef76b94846774dcada7838257dd223e04c4126b you poisoned your wife, i know; you are a murderer yourself!”
0x0e76a2a3a1ee599d3a9e6fb893d72ffa998f22fc she held the revolver ready.
0x5f889a38c7f4369420dacd1ae647aa59234f08a4 “are you so positive i poisoned marfa petrovna?”
0x9d3f2801dd2fe63719e6bdcd7e271c1ce5f6df0f “you did!
0x6c26d852b51712a4f760dfa17d7dcce15fc9d72b you hinted it yourself; you talked to me of poison.... i know you went to get it... you had it in readiness.... it was your doing.... it must have been your doing.... scoundrel!”
0xcc55d43c483badce14632ea376bee97509c91a1d “even if that were true, it would have been for your sake... you would have been the cause.”
0x0a333475082e152b96283110a8cf159bcf095f9b “you are lying!
0xd66ebff6efc72af6976ff7d264fefde2b632c76f i hated you always, always....” “oho, avdotya romanovna!
0xbe374ce9b1ed405891a9589a56825e8c45e98542 you seem to have forgotten how you softened to me in the heat of propaganda.
0x8858705e364c1f414a0e15aafc296241ac3b3bf9 i saw it in your eyes.
0xf2c135b4d3ffae780f29fa2cdabb5417b65fcc25 do you remember that moonlight night, when the nightingale was singing?”
0x80dc18b6e1f55f1239e006581204f702c05970a9 “that’s a lie,” there was a flash of fury in dounia’s eyes, “that’s a lie and a libel!”
0x79297ec6a6e4968ecb8c9941811625da0f3eec2b “a lie?
0x6bb581a76a0c350e7f3242ce7168a9894a957b0b well, if you like, it’s a lie.
0xaab4857d5859ca6f5ef65eccc0b8346c78feda43 i made it up.
0x650fea5bfd51100fa5c483625458541686e157af women ought not to be reminded of such things,” he smiled.
0x9e09f28a7f1978e200ffe363a81eb9bfa1476ce7 “i know you will shoot, you pretty wild creature.
0x1535a68109daf8ee42a6767773cf3e100fe0fcb8 well, shoot away!”
0x0f84914c8b1069b649eb5686f982e38ed17d0d32 dounia raised the revolver, and deadly pale, gazed at him, measuring the distance and awaiting the first movement on his part.
0xabe1013ad10aa06a360f5ff6332f79b63e8ca004 her lower lip was white and quivering and her big black eyes flashed like fire.
0xe4faf60bcce62e3a64c4bcda437f9b7e4c8f9131 he had never seen her so handsome.
0x0d491a6582e1ba611fe10652e52b229827365d7a the fire glowing in her eyes at the moment she raised the revolver seemed to kindle him and there was a pang of anguish in his heart.
0x93c7e02062a68d92a77f09396e0cba65080fd5e8 he took a step forward and a shot rang out.
0xb9a0dfe7cb514e801881c16e12dbae0e354c51a4 the bullet grazed his hair and flew into the wall behind.
0xe968675153c7230c423a3b13f3d641950f7dfb93 he stood still and laughed softly.
0xeabdc332aa22cec939cdb5ab117e096e7956534b “the wasp has stung me.
0x2a7e3983cd651c0422a7975513771c0d3d886f58 she aimed straight at my head.
0x65f06dc4e4bb6fcc56e389d7dac9248682a2a37b what’s this?
0xcdb9c2d9bcc43b6154bbc9f3f488715d907feec2 blood?”
0x7ec61ab568dae326bc7844ed8c37e2d96e78c63c he pulled out his handkerchief to wipe the blood, which flowed in a thin stream down his right temple.
0xea2cbd1da270900c14f8f8257bb674642ed13a24 the bullet seemed to have just grazed the skin.
0xd982d16c43fd2408d22cf4f2848a951e416a889c dounia lowered the revolver and looked at svidrigaïlov not so much in terror as in a sort of wild amazement.
0xc0128ae679191d3f4cd37ef2ff2ca4516d3d0d44 she seemed not to understand what she was doing and what was going on.
0x50963bf105f355f2b6a6691998badd6ebebc35ed “well, you missed!
0x148b3ea8a36a432716e6e5cdd8fd2609e39656f5 fire again, i’ll wait,” said svidrigaïlov softly, still smiling, but gloomily.
0x1b8a0e2324d175424d216ac3cd2aeea2f8033182 “if you go on like that, i shall have time to seize you before you cock again.”
0x1b43646c3227ca87162f49f7245b52efa10f2f6f dounia started, quickly cocked the pistol and again raised it.
0x9c854aa439b0b4b66faa00979c64cfcdee580b78 “let me be,” she cried in despair.
0x704915b04e5311f922f1abc59ca25fab4e126b9b “i swear i’ll shoot again.
0x507b877409e635e20211de02899dd7eae4469f1d i... i’ll kill you.”
0x385723747979ee51f7c8552b7c1c24da817aa942 “well... at three paces you can hardly help it.
0x59e64f6c40267ebf25f571ef388f1137a789249f but if you don’t... then.”
0xbaf77e45a2017e20541fa44dae7d4714b33317c4 his eyes flashed and he took two steps forward.
0x01003bd2cefcc275fc6b9a5911864320040e6539 dounia shot again: it missed fire.
0x73aa03c5a631347a3689c6938c0d15d16d09e8fa “you haven’t loaded it properly.
0x9786260d729856c6f0f0aad1c45b1f6f137f0e5a never mind, you have another charge there.
0xbd181152fb455a8fd1ad44d4efe5d289d73b7586 get it ready, i’ll wait.”
0x7951084d07b0dbec52966dd30e8432654e43ac1a he stood facing her, two paces away, waiting and gazing at her with wild determination, with feverishly passionate, stubborn, set eyes.
0x94a8218a09ecb746d84b5ad988009f4e1be070a2 dounia saw that he would sooner die than let her go.
0x1248097117509fc82613a4a95626a1c1d14340c4 “and... now, of course she would kill him, at two paces!”
0xd8c29990dafdf473c431905c7a56eae9d188cf5b suddenly she flung away the revolver.
0xc6cdc0a3c30381b599cb1c48128360e38412c385 “she’s dropped it!”
0xb18a682dbf0bf1d47c0cd40ca256ae0cfe54f646 said svidrigaïlov with surprise, and he drew a deep breath.
0xbfed4aded3accf282c7c0398a403e0ca845cf429 a weight seemed to have rolled from his heart--perhaps not only the fear of death; indeed he may scarcely have felt it at that moment.
0x8c74f3f784f065a5a78692db3024bfcec6cc6a33 it was the deliverance from another feeling, darker and more bitter, which he could not himself have defined.
0xe79a1f2af74982380d5294f713f2e8b3b4f3f57f he went to dounia and gently put his arm round her waist.
0x122b05b21b2b031d60b294fbb0d8a694d22d5142 she did not resist, but, trembling like a leaf, looked at him with suppliant eyes.
0x4e11561826e03a8992997485a0819da5af871297 he tried to say something, but his lips moved without being able to utter a sound.
0x2040439b4d45c8c0eeee5e8c4d410e04406357ed “let me go,” dounia implored.
0x4aa6176d6c814902f1837ba2f389fda46eb8208d svidrigaïlov shuddered.
0xc43f8ea149d2eae12e2a18a184632e7a372a6312 her voice now was quite different.
0x398272241308da2fd09fd44d483ae9908e5270fd “then you don’t love me?”
0xffe54dcd7c346f33461ea73b241ba58cebe27f20 he asked softly.
0x9f6b9e9586f75b286cdb907f78c53bdfbc82ca1b dounia shook her head.
0x16c3369ca5c306fa807763100e7936214b6d8f07 “and... and you can’t?
0xa9fe05cc96264bee896ead4cdccc2403f8916bf0 never?”
0x77fdf1e082cece9e10638625b0899c7efd137ce3 he whispered in despair.
0xd4f6c0d25dbe5362c923940ac2b4e37bd3a60e26 “never!”
0xf7798d5dd56b9d36b8e307511b28308fc5362baf there followed a moment of terrible, dumb struggle in the heart of svidrigaïlov.
0x9740f5bef66249f5ca17795301fc5d6938bae4fb he looked at her with an indescribable gaze.
0x6486688034cda7cbb277b1362611a2c219353572 suddenly he withdrew his arm, turned quickly to the window and stood facing it.
0x32ca74bb8265b5c13a21349dea154a44c68b0502 another moment passed.
0x23deba9966d1072d8f6b9990afd057d8412e3863 “here’s the key.”
0x7a7a4791a760ec90f90103d1cf3af70d6ef8195d he took it out of the left pocket of his coat and laid it on the table behind him, without turning or looking at dounia.
0x4630ce6ed1d9dcb2c6286bb98d0285a355ca5ce9 “take it!
0x4ff4bef98f08c5f19381cff1baed8dc594f491cc make haste!”
0x184fe12aefe79a63613f63d34e039b375928f6e3 he looked stubbornly out of the window.
0xf594cad6941037d005eb086328e3be210e1782a5 dounia went up to the table to take the key.
0x2d3817f57fd135370985c65eca38dc2db12c9944 “make haste!
0x4ff4bef98f08c5f19381cff1baed8dc594f491cc make haste!”
0x92dd0c144a3f5f8bf1db039f84c74865fb976660 repeated svidrigaïlov, still without turning or moving.
0x478d16318948a77297a8b12724984c050ea4e6b4 but there seemed a terrible significance in the tone of that “make haste.”
0x68f762b339bebab3df8c5c33cc40fefdd41bcac5 dounia understood it, snatched up the key, flew to the door, unlocked it quickly and rushed out of the room.
0x576de2752ed1a7d39ca6edbcb04df6b4c1002c6c a minute later, beside herself, she ran out on to the canal bank in the direction of x. bridge.
0xb3901003705f0626b9de67d39d19bbf776f5924b svidrigaïlov remained three minutes standing at the window.
0xd8ad8e275fc742098f52ccce585979075f25a93f at last he slowly turned, looked about him and passed his hand over his forehead.
0x59a1cbda20208d0a9b4f0746d583faf8fd0a0628 a strange smile contorted his face, a pitiful, sad, weak smile, a smile of despair.
0x72580587899bc24440aa792cad16bc1f248e5fb8 the blood, which was already getting dry, smeared his hand.
0x082466bedd78c22dafb1c038001309f0f99bc46f he looked angrily at it, then wetted a towel and washed his temple.
0x120610c47151c65d762e4d453f2d2d12abb10876 the revolver which dounia had flung away lay near the door and suddenly caught his eye.
0x85e931fdd02a64e8bf40657c76c89d2cb59a1cdc he picked it up and examined it.
0x9d9ce59c7354f686fc0b33ba7136710ac8089669 it was a little pocket three-barrel revolver of old-fashioned construction.
0x1f88bc0cd732ed22c76c736918d87143c05b06b1 there were still two charges and one capsule left in it.
0xa39179c08589a771b0e9f70789aae56430912633 it could be fired again.
0x3be179819552ad10e50b0a3ccd29d7f3b7a6f637 he thought a little, put the revolver in his pocket, took his hat and went out.
0xe9d20f5b649f0bb3ca10b10650d6adcd4f7d92ce chapter vi he spent that evening till ten o’clock going from one low haunt to another.
0xbd2b7ece10b1dcd006930197593b5d57c0ad5884 katia too turned up and sang another gutter song, how a certain “villain and tyrant,” “began kissing katia.”
0x32f050ff8150c30c78ed278ed764725fde7263f0 svidrigaïlov treated katia and the organ-grinder and some singers and the waiters and two little clerks.
0x7733e7e50675189f5cf76b28b83ba77e90cab251 he was particularly drawn to these clerks by the fact that they both had crooked noses, one bent to the left and the other to the right.
0x79c9a4799f1dea6925c74eac6017dbd13ef52dd1 they took him finally to a pleasure garden, where he paid for their entrance.
0xca123b7041f30d39cf50686cfb2eb43bc78a8514 there was one lanky three-year-old pine-tree and three bushes in the garden, besides a “vauxhall,” which was in reality a drinking-bar where tea too was served, and there were a few green tables and chairs standing round it.
0x1ad976999e78bb308b3a1359d36ec758e9eba28f a chorus of wretched singers and a drunken but exceedingly depressed german clown from munich with a red nose entertained the public.
0x303b0d61877bc8e193a0115a66d5014c990927c6 the clerks quarrelled with some other clerks and a fight seemed imminent.
0x9dbffadddaea8d68611312083ad65008a1b6b0f5 svidrigaïlov was chosen to decide the dispute.
0x547ffaaff290f134ad1db4319d20d95d13bb65af he listened to them for a quarter of an hour, but they shouted so loud that there was no possibility of understanding them.
0x9c5efdcc6980ed7acc2bd750300d9ab3342148f3 the only fact that seemed certain was that one of them had stolen something and had even succeeded in selling it on the spot to a jew, but would not share the spoil with his companion.
0xbc0bc1b9a39154f8f73e32f1c731bee0f4632b5c finally it appeared that the stolen object was a teaspoon belonging to the vauxhall.
0x26c6988f42542200090efbbd637efc2d56f33aed it was missed and the affair began to seem troublesome.
0x37c09c737549973541cf51699bbf347eb2be2dea svidrigaïlov paid for the spoon, got up, and walked out of the garden.
0x99a19acaafbc6c4a42cdf64ea930e229d416a412 it was about six o’clock.
0x3e744f5a7d752a4c15fd6778cd4596033deadb4e he had not drunk a drop of wine all this time and had ordered tea more for the sake of appearances than anything.
0x87673979304dc1421929a8ad532aae2b4e8666bf it was a dark and stifling evening.
0xc46a62cef4f46dbd44774527e6b1e7cf2b85f644 threatening storm-clouds came over the sky about ten o’clock.
0x1d01ea40ac1b7a3e9b89d0d3300edc97f331ccc0 there was a clap of thunder, and the rain came down like a waterfall.
0xd64a34bac2141a9e8b8d67a4706685dd6087930e the water fell not in drops, but beat on the earth in streams.
0x801d7e9e5641f55b0886d6d4b08b29862a517d64 there were flashes of lightning every minute and each flash lasted while one could count five.
0x3ddcc1ec4b4a6c5b71e03fb7237126fa24d5574c drenched to the skin, he went home, locked himself in, opened the bureau, took out all his money and tore up two or three papers.
0x2b3679560e89634fb93408d56b2802aab1c57bf1 then, putting the money in his pocket, he was about to change his clothes, but, looking out of the window and listening to the thunder and the rain, he gave up the idea, took up his hat and went out of the room without locking the door.
0x895e60a392c13f1502d5db4e30f0d6536199df49 he went straight to sonia.
0x033f2d3df4e48b93374332f5661cbf5035b7f48c she was at home.
0x88ded05af2b7197d8a67fbfb9c6d17c9939ae602 she was not alone: the four kapernaumov children were with her.
0x139d3479a9ebf1bb1adbade52563f4d0bf3c07e4 she was giving them tea.
0x21006aa9d093ecaa855329cbb88b6789a760a743 she received svidrigaïlov in respectful silence, looking wonderingly at his soaking clothes.
0x1f473b1bac5dd3faa45aced199bccc235d14f02c the children all ran away at once in indescribable terror.
0xe121b5e99f7bb479ab0a1f964cfcd6a2a4ddddb7 svidrigaïlov sat down at the table and asked sonia to sit beside him.
0x59dc14e6300070d19b319595b059572e9a626c5b she timidly prepared to listen.
0x880c4932df268fb7154a0d77ef0d379b4130717a “i may be going to america, sofya semyonovna,” said svidrigaïlov, “and as i am probably seeing you for the last time, i have come to make some arrangements.
0x901268f1f7b1f4f41bf4fa57eeb447d09e9bed3a well, did you see the lady to-day?
0x6f29d147452bcd8900cc7db91f66c91c39f3f949 i know what she said to you, you need not tell me.”
0x6d704a67761de3dfdcaa9237b150ad499e347715 (sonia made a movement and blushed.)
0x5c7c9c2d05a95e6a7e2a78b33468ea4cea4e6263 “those people have their own way of doing things.
0xa1846395df6ac857494a6f8932bd08715b788adc as to your sisters and your brother, they are really provided for and the money assigned to them i’ve put into safe keeping and have received acknowledgments.

0x25c4bc8f72276d2d096dd6c0e496562b506610c7 here, take them!
0x5e3c8f21a173191f68643898aeea821c4d117924 well now, that’s settled.
0x14c6c24587b64c72c9e6b6520b4cab83a541f12b here are three 5-per-cent bonds to the value of three thousand roubles.

0xbcf5ed848ae0881eb99998ac99fc540e2880b33a you will need the money, for to go on living in the old way, sofya semyonovna, is bad, and besides there is no need for it now.”
0xcdd7618ded94a123975e95b2d3f29f3dcf8bbfce “i am so much indebted to you, and so are the children and my stepmother,” said sonia hurriedly, “and if i’ve said so little... please don’t consider...” “that’s enough!
0x685b84138b86efc575b55c72af2c1c78a89f2ca1 that’s enough!”
0xfd37cfb13f8659138f744fa7cb7118b4c549e290 “but as for the money, arkady ivanovitch, i am very grateful to you, but i don’t need it now.

0x2c7cfa742d3ea8ccf1ac475d9c268fe636c07c52 (sonia looked wildly at him, and started.)
0xdaaf63489b98edd4cf8ce56f93fe9d6091db2c88 “don’t be uneasy, i know all about it from himself and i am not a gossip; i won’t tell anyone.
0x16ce4b5f2c1b6f8ee834392a345dfb19c3abc9d9 it was good advice when you told him to give himself up and confess.

0x0b995a5cd85360ef96f187f2a533ffd82dd41390 well, if it turns out to be siberia, he will go and you will follow him.

0x8d8e0c6504fba5a8ff901539c89ab962f05628c1 (he got up.)
0x0a6a5564a7faa9fd3480ac2455ad0bde1bd892cb “my greetings to rodion romanovitch.

0x21c3eeb14fe559aba8fd8b89f5bcc62d49c0406e sonia too jumped up from her chair and looked in dismay at svidrigaïlov.
0xd77f1e5b4f122ae03b5b0d993dbbd3e1fd993f5f she longed to speak, to ask a question, but for the first moments she did not dare and did not know how to begin.

0x937a283d22fd9c88d72581c5f2f27a7cc3476c2a be sure to.”
0xdf69626f0a2a98742456329e1eb7230bba59e8c8 he went out, leaving sonia in a state of wondering anxiety and vague apprehension.
0xd5b35808d4459fc76540a18ef5838baa09d42af8 it appeared afterwards that on the same evening, at twenty past eleven, he made another very eccentric and unexpected visit.
0xd68c4ca1ef78dead8d4a7871ee907ad752665c91 the rain still persisted.
0x4d3f64eb34f1e9d75929201aeb574784913fc38a drenched to the skin, he walked into the little flat where the parents of his betrothed lived, in third street in vassilyevsky island.
0x218ff64ac9442d6edd8598a44ab04d26ca771105 he knocked some time before he was admitted, and his visit at first caused great perturbation; but svidrigaïlov could be very fascinating when he liked, so that the first, and indeed very intelligent surmise of the sensible parents that svidrigaïlov had probably had so much to drink that he did not know what he was doing vanished immediately.
0x06cb8b0e9d21f925d243f25c14609bccf0d56480 the decrepit father was wheeled in to see svidrigaïlov by the tender and sensible mother, who as usual began the conversation with various irrelevant questions.
0x4d82df2d0c9c09af55a40b4fbf1314329da2edc5 she never asked a direct question, but began by smiling and rubbing her hands and then, if she were obliged to ascertain something--for instance, when svidrigaïlov would like to have the wedding--she would begin by interested and almost eager questions about paris and the court life there, and only by degrees brought the conversation round to third street.
0xf513243e672ce6b4a16dfd719789e2f5e6a3910b on other occasions this had of course been very impressive, but this time arkady ivanovitch seemed particularly impatient, and insisted on seeing his betrothed at once, though he had been informed, to begin with, that she had already gone to bed.
0xc491db1b69923f4b8631da8ef7a23c870cc50f4f the girl of course appeared.
0x33806f9dcdfd6fec7657a09a7f3d9b9a392ecabe svidrigaïlov informed her at once that he was obliged by very important affairs to leave petersburg for a time, and therefore brought her fifteen thousand roubles and begged her accept them as a present from him, as he had long been intending to make her this trifling present before their wedding.
0xf685a3b592e2b74012d993ebee7717b5927874b1 the logical connection of the present with his immediate departure and the absolute necessity of visiting them for that purpose in pouring rain at midnight was not made clear.
0x231a9859c8259d3ace742982629e69bab3e78b6b but it all went off very well; even the inevitable ejaculations of wonder and regret, the inevitable questions were extraordinarily few and restrained.
0xc4c99f9b6aac7e128f9f77ac8353921940b1174c on the other hand, the gratitude expressed was most glowing and was reinforced by tears from the most sensible of mothers.
0xc068ac0fbc1323904c7d06dca525ac2e4ba3ec75 svidrigaïlov got up, laughed, kissed his betrothed, patted her cheek, declared he would soon come back, and noticing in her eyes, together with childish curiosity, a sort of earnest dumb inquiry, reflected and kissed her again, though he felt sincere anger inwardly at the thought that his present would be immediately locked up in the keeping of the most sensible of mothers.
0x4d68257cc63f7794415a863ed9f4dfc1fcb3fda8 he went away, leaving them all in a state of extraordinary excitement, but the tender mamma, speaking quietly in a half whisper, settled some of the most important of their doubts, concluding that svidrigaïlov was a great man, a man of great affairs and connections and of great wealth--there was no knowing what he had in his mind.
0x72920d1723a34bacc11fc6e1e76e57d378b57c20 he would start off on a journey and give away money just as the fancy took him, so that there was nothing surprising about it.
0x34d024704d9ba930187b7bce774ecba29bf5de79 of course it was strange that he was wet through, but englishmen, for instance, are even more eccentric, and all these people of high society didn’t think of what was said of them and didn’t stand on ceremony.
0x1e969f1e07bd7ef0d4e015ac85619ce1e1372b6b possibly, indeed, he came like that on purpose to show that he was not afraid of anyone.
0x3326f3a17adf1fd5785dd0298133539e8056a743 above all, not a word should be said about it, for god knows what might come of it, and the money must be locked up, and it was most fortunate that fedosya, the cook, had not left the kitchen.
0x027f5137aafdc9c0212acba23bc8f3776c8fe9ab and above all not a word must be said to that old cat, madame resslich, and so on and so on.
0x12eb03ff2ee5f8b4190bf3b84f0365f3699bd026 they sat up whispering till two o’clock, but the girl went to bed much earlier, amazed and rather sorrowful.
0x194c9357c480762449909747a9bef6bf7fc9b76b svidrigaïlov meanwhile, exactly at midnight, crossed the bridge on the way back to the mainland.
0xc9101f9ee59361d814f4a8ad659fc58c089d4c27 the rain had ceased and there was a roaring wind.
0x17715fb602fcdd4c956732fcd6ebf275bfa0e03e he began shivering, and for one moment he gazed at the black waters of the little neva with a look of special interest, even inquiry.
0x0a4fcf08706361b69fd937b11990c8382676d386 but he soon felt it very cold, standing by the water; he turned and went towards y. prospect.
0x569c3b0c71a03a126b101049d58f00ef399f3daf he walked along that endless street for a long time, almost half an hour, more than once stumbling in the dark on the wooden pavement, but continually looking for something on the right side of the street.
0x485415619b1341f9bb301e109a3f69a6236da5e2 he had noticed passing through this street lately that there was a hotel somewhere towards the end, built of wood, but fairly large, and its name he remembered was something like adrianople.
0xcde7f3e979698db9b76be048fb065f2ea8260513 he was not mistaken: the hotel was so conspicuous in that god-forsaken place that he could not fail to see it even in the dark.
0x83ba29749a13428e02156e3e2ded376ed08f3e43 it was a long, blackened wooden building, and in spite of the late hour there were lights in the windows and signs of life within.
0x76f3f78bfd6efb430ae5c48b0ea7c2bb51990023 he went in and asked a ragged fellow who met him in the corridor for a room.
0x444be9bc6f449d74fcbd64ec91810969a597f882 the latter, scanning svidrigaïlov, pulled himself together and led him at once to a close and tiny room in the distance, at the end of the corridor, under the stairs.
0x679514ef1f5beb855e7eefb8b70689f1e3251ef5 there was no other, all were occupied.
0xdbca15c22a6c9d69ffd6f2253666ac3d87870e83 the ragged fellow looked inquiringly.
0x0dd6f431cf32de6716d42141df00021c7d8aacf2 “is there tea?”
0x14a234f571ada6bc9d5913a1a664b4f5db287061 asked svidrigaïlov.
0x3d5285adb6e556984bdf9d6873bf28f48d7c2d1d “yes, sir.”
0xc7c9ace8567ad9be726ead1f88dd7e81cd4fa476 “what else is there?”
0x2ffd41b46e02e9d02ff0b2ef850ceb0deda18ea5 “veal, vodka, savouries.”
0x8313f4321e1c4740fee2bb27ccb030569c0ec22d “bring me tea and veal.”
0x40d847e379ddf9551fc42b05ce6da0917d8125ec “and you want nothing else?”
0xb3c4119c3fa4f7796e18482d725b197e066a5676 he asked with apparent surprise.
0xa54797f62266f567d3c15ac7dbe28049603fe055 “nothing, nothing.”
0x546079e3d8f7b40ff86f45ac316904560e2e5288 the ragged man went away, completely disillusioned.
0x393099804017021645a0f86710d545edcf87ca8a “it must be a nice place,” thought svidrigaïlov.
0xc7877d8ac857a717982248476fcb3205b92b18e7 “how was it i didn’t know it?
0xdbfc4737d1b3b92d1fa34d711aa6d5f504e1b6bf i expect i look as if i came from a café chantant and have had some adventure on the way.
0xe89f331554f7e1d2e1c8b1c524338276f2e99a3e it would be interesting to know who stayed here?”
0x106e3f503670397cadd0dda627949d6d37631a57 he lighted the candle and looked at the room more carefully.
0x283feea01941423c430e79dd256aedcf3c1938b4 it was a room so low-pitched that svidrigaïlov could only just stand up in it; it had one window; the bed, which was very dirty, and the plain-stained chair and table almost filled it up.
0x58e1750bdf5b72a754930ab8287e40d0e6fde21b the walls looked as though they were made of planks, covered with shabby paper, so torn and dusty that the pattern was indistinguishable, though the general colour--yellow--could still be made out.
0x144498d6a22fa5aa08e6050e5e33b5a59b617eb4 one of the walls was cut short by the sloping ceiling, though the room was not an attic but just under the stairs.
0xf59b18c301cf4cc39cc975168c932f72f16a103c svidrigaïlov set down the candle, sat down on the bed and sank into thought.
0xd133a56d3270e87016087de4de6dc138f7c1de3f but a strange persistent murmur which sometimes rose to a shout in the next room attracted his attention.
0xa912bac19441ca3ceedfddfde55f71271f409295 the murmur had not ceased from the moment he entered the room.
0xa3f8100d3a7d4fb6e3a9e1454157ce884681e459 he listened: someone was upbraiding and almost tearfully scolding, but he heard only one voice.
0xb9ab8230febd710ef83c34462e54a8e28bae8871 svidrigaïlov got up, shaded the light with his hand and at once he saw light through a crack in the wall; he went up and peeped through.
0x8c4006a11c98f2cdb030072f79717fbb1255c515 the room, which was somewhat larger than his, had two occupants.
0x7f45d6255bb1bb56c501d34d25e8a5d556ac27c1 one of them, a very curly-headed man with a red inflamed face, was standing in the pose of an orator, without his coat, with his legs wide apart to preserve his balance, and smiting himself on the breast.
0x7dadcd945f1e92141ada31f813fb8960f107f654 he reproached the other with being a beggar, with having no standing whatever.
0xb6450e98ddac7defcaef0a1f841057c22c72e80d he declared that he had taken the other out of the gutter and he could turn him out when he liked, and that only the finger of providence sees it all.
0x4cb1570388b7e3a75d60914884898989788f87c5 the object of his reproaches was sitting in a chair, and had the air of a man who wants dreadfully to sneeze, but can’t.
0xe1695a19a6c4fcb31e3a44870f576222eb3043f0 he sometimes turned sheepish and befogged eyes on the speaker, but obviously had not the slightest idea what he was talking about and scarcely heard it.
0xc79141e31781c70af9966e659fdeed4068d61bb4 a candle was burning down on the table; there were wine-glasses, a nearly empty bottle of vodka, bread and cucumber, and glasses with the dregs of stale tea.
0x7fbb005489cb256c57b6e9027f6de8c4b1a84ca1 after gazing attentively at this, svidrigaïlov turned away indifferently and sat down on the bed.
0x3c305fefa99b5c7275c0f78834722593ec2cea12 the ragged attendant, returning with the tea, could not resist asking him again whether he didn’t want anything more, and again receiving a negative reply, finally withdrew.
0x29ff5c79d15dae21b56efc7b1eb4a9f33229e845 svidrigaïlov made haste to drink a glass of tea to warm himself, but could not eat anything.
0xddd2d0d9f1d470acd7f81fe73840024c3744d9d6 he began to feel feverish.
0xb61d4e7f4120d7b4df4be27d00c6df9f241d6eab he took off his coat and, wrapping himself in the blanket, lay down on the bed.
0x92068782280e8580782cb77d82424b93e9eeb148 he was annoyed.
0x6a2779b3a3bdf49ebff94476a105beb6cbe7584c “it would have been better to be well for the occasion,” he thought with a smile.
0x8e3f532411a8b2e3bfc6362cc91a7ba64d5b5b9c the room was close, the candle burnt dimly, the wind was roaring outside, he heard a mouse scratching in the corner and the room smelt of mice and of leather.
0x1b2ad0e979014410e16ff7a348306bc7138e376f he lay in a sort of reverie: one thought followed another.
0x83bb9dee0c836710b3d6301aeef238ca396cb89b he felt a longing to fix his imagination on something.
0x655d9c8a4615576b06b52dc35aeec9657083d618 “it must be a garden under the window,” he thought.
0xdfbcd3f560bca5dad72ebd6fc9dd4148bf0390ac “there’s a sound of trees.
0xed209b2a180be983c57d3180ce7c40c73b2dbf01 how i dislike the sound of trees on a stormy night, in the dark!
0xe64bea463f49aa9a1134a3a6c680d2d9bdeae3c7 they give one a horrid feeling.”
0xefa780f67df8a25df10425c3484ee50fdb24e3fb he remembered how he had disliked it when he passed petrovsky park just now.
0x20547d516c76bd6564813ce9da67538f8bd4ca68 this reminded him of the bridge over the little neva and he felt cold again as he had when standing there.
0x42f2bce94476d39e5d6011d2a1c1be0ed8cf38d3 “i never have liked water,” he thought, “even in a landscape,” and he suddenly smiled again at a strange idea: “surely now all these questions of taste and comfort ought not to matter, but i’ve become more particular, like an animal that picks out a special place... for such an occasion.
0x1c4aa33e30e9974fb0bc2561da594f802c52e470 i ought to have gone into the petrovsky park!
0x2b424636172a11e870822c99e7b76f9ac3426318 i suppose it seemed dark, cold, ha-ha!
0x0c9fa378fe1e03df0acb085042dfe59abd5fd464 as though i were seeking pleasant sensations!... by the way, why haven’t i put out the candle?”
0x7a37b6748d5d71e54e39def81718e658c0ecdc22 he blew it out.
0x9de7d568b97d2fefa47600c34f0e44f3ef0b1cda “they’ve gone to bed next door,” he thought, not seeing the light at the crack.
0x5d34242acdb39f52d32051e41d34b7bc61342f34 “well, now, marfa petrovna, now is the time for you to turn up; it’s dark, and the very time and place for you.
0x43dee11ac1c7f0de83cf0ead312d9d3df1350a11 but now you won’t come!”
0xa82c89a9973e78f175ae53d4e2adad2cf8d36436 he suddenly recalled how, an hour before carrying out his design on dounia, he had recommended raskolnikov to trust her to razumihin’s keeping.
0x7c9b3d59587e9ee52c5a7cd00a8b177b9bad5519 “i suppose i really did say it, as raskolnikov guessed, to tease myself.
0x093965ac07ee4de252db3c096f559b88cf6d569d but what a rogue that raskolnikov is!
0x0e551b7ddfab75961f2365dad4a1e7c69acd4f0a he’s gone through a good deal.
0xece635c576fc7da8849e64e2e8d0d73379b84381 he may be a successful rogue in time when he’s got over his nonsense.
0xd40acc6898c204d73f38bc9a7affcba1d8ed1760 but now he’s _too_ eager for life.
0x2f405a62965454a383bb3a8e463f6fe330fec4e8 these young men are contemptible on that point.
0x6da1f11b5ad3276173a1408bf04f94100f6302ff but, hang the fellow!
0xd08e33af381a0fcfdc65a9953b584adb0a6020a4 let him please himself, it’s nothing to do with me.”
0xf440feab86e6e9e4566863e8a745232d7b710d3d he could not get to sleep.
0x01f77c822d64766a88f7088beb703539c10dae87 by degrees dounia’s image rose before him, and a shudder ran over him.
0x4bb4b9729a5baa5f657413fbadf642a725ae24da “no, i must give up all that now,” he thought, rousing himself.
0x22b8afee6db3b2a083afac429fe2488b8054d83e “i must think of something else.
0x2b80ea834518da65385ed1ac2a32981f6a054b25 it’s queer and funny.
0xcbc3612857c0bab7f3d78c8ebb1f3f8e95f3c5f6 i never had a great hatred for anyone, i never particularly desired to avenge myself even, and that’s a bad sign, a bad sign, a bad sign.
0x226bad61c34bdd8cc4975c6b4fc5478752c60837 i never liked quarrelling either, and never lost my temper--that’s a bad sign too.
0xe92d2bd1cada6c0ebb7b3901b2e557e8fa63b2f6 and the promises i made her just now, too--damnation!
0xad9ac5051539189d9e02ed35117cc90c2d6a072f but--who knows?--perhaps she would have made a new man of me somehow....” he ground his teeth and sank into silence again.
0x78624c7e89a277884b0383ef4aadb06e96251a6f again dounia’s image rose before him, just as she was when, after shooting the first time, she had lowered the revolver in terror and gazed blankly at him, so that he might have seized her twice over and she would not have lifted a hand to defend herself if he had not reminded her.
0xc9bb856b20677aecff2c82114d3aa7b127429067 he recalled how at that instant he felt almost sorry for her, how he had felt a pang at his heart... “aïe!
0xe85b021021e162d2715efaf42028a4edbbc6142f damnation, these thoughts again!
0x4f551b7f75716df896cbe3fb17da0a7daa825bee i must put it away!”
0x716995b0be0d8d28d485fbf20fbd9f341a4a3afc he was dozing off; the feverish shiver had ceased, when suddenly something seemed to run over his arm and leg under the bedclothes.
0x3410a12165c10a626fa74b580b92a386046b5829 he started.
0xc4f8069814364509cb959c619f958bc008900147 “ugh!
0x305c9341c1edb93d50e3169cc9bc154205f7d513 hang it!
0x013b233b8cf0d968424c44a618bfa92e936d47a0 i believe it’s a mouse,” he thought, “that’s the veal i left on the table.”
0xd8504b35b371c2e52727dbef5b7a28c02bcbbac2 he felt fearfully disinclined to pull off the blanket, get up, get cold, but all at once something unpleasant ran over his leg again.
0xc9970a7631a87fbb4ed92bac96e7fc365e199757 he pulled off the blanket and lighted the candle.
0x98b9df66b1e7606a68dbe2c900cd095bffeead48 shaking with feverish chill he bent down to examine the bed: there was nothing.
0x295848d4d4c1f06d82195bc87107ef674c286b5e he shook the blanket and suddenly a mouse jumped out on the sheet.
0x286683bd51e38dde12d5bf766e5f6db61e458dcc he tried to catch it, but the mouse ran to and fro in zigzags without leaving the bed, slipped between his fingers, ran over his hand and suddenly darted under the pillow.
0x553a56bebdb7a4c8a1fb5d99d3dae6be6c3f6063 he threw down the pillow, but in one instant felt something leap on his chest and dart over his body and down his back under his shirt.
0xf47a4ec7d81c94655560dc76c915599cc8ae52e7 he trembled nervously and woke up.
0x0e596f9038aac589c2639f07f8797ad1997f9230 the room was dark.
0x8e1a12ca4e65969db5b8c1904a5b395a49766b6c he was lying on the bed and wrapped up in the blanket as before.
0x6d8d3068d1499b5c44a1bebe9a39169d8f050530 the wind was howling under the window.
0x68c237ab6084344381b351743a7a3028530e8228 “how disgusting,” he thought with annoyance.
0x36fc1cba617b94e6a7db74ee24f0a5d2d0e6af94 he got up and sat on the edge of the bedstead with his back to the window.
0x829d52655747b72b8128081cecb9468a380a8656 “it’s better not to sleep at all,” he decided.
0xb77a844f7efac11eb145b607e0559d4b932d8756 there was a cold damp draught from the window, however; without getting up he drew the blanket over him and wrapped himself in it.
0x5fc10308012d45735bb01017b3f61fec59415f8e he was not thinking of anything and did not want to think.
0x5de1f698a09a47c1604d92b357d3927a65d0fe01 but one image rose after another, incoherent scraps of thought without beginning or end passed through his mind.
0x419d0f0262f9aeafef40e760bf18637192093594 he sank into drowsiness.
0x666510138d1ddc096256ee58e14c9c459c3bb926 perhaps the cold, or the dampness, or the dark, or the wind that howled under the window and tossed the trees roused a sort of persistent craving for the fantastic.
0xf889ec8342ca7181b65e6e933806cda93cc9bf90 he kept dwelling on images of flowers, he fancied a charming flower garden, a bright, warm, almost hot day, a holiday--trinity day.
0x362fd440a31861bafe9169c392df6dc1268d1d83 a fine, sumptuous country cottage in the english taste overgrown with fragrant flowers, with flower beds going round the house; the porch, wreathed in climbers, was surrounded with beds of roses.
0x13f794504e39fa0c2acae4e537b0423c53c55d44 a light, cool staircase, carpeted with rich rugs, was decorated with rare plants in china pots.
0x519f35c25b96da283b9201f82611366d4e51a8c5 he noticed particularly in the windows nosegays of tender, white, heavily fragrant narcissus bending over their bright, green, thick long stalks.
0x789ae9194bf2816e4af7f948422f1aac061425fb he was reluctant to move away from them, but he went up the stairs and came into a large, high drawing-room and again everywhere--at the windows, the doors on to the balcony, and on the balcony itself--were flowers.
0x65c67c900db67a5f05b4b015f77f9672388f4b46 the floors were strewn with freshly-cut fragrant hay, the windows were open, a fresh, cool, light air came into the room.
0x55144d95d50e8ae92bf320cd2dacf0165e88c477 the birds were chirruping under the window, and in the middle of the room, on a table covered with a white satin shroud, stood a coffin.
0xb9e6738fa80f9948e65c66ae062fd64d58de01ef the coffin was covered with white silk and edged with a thick white frill; wreaths of flowers surrounded it on all sides.
0x4ade42f03e96bec4e6c25a32a10019311beae426 among the flowers lay a girl in a white muslin dress, with her arms crossed and pressed on her bosom, as though carved out of marble.
0x65588c10d09c242c663c519e92439ee505966dfa but her loose fair hair was wet; there was a wreath of roses on her head.
0xb9040ed132b301a402f036fae4b30c5bc4c75aba the stern and already rigid profile of her face looked as though chiselled of marble too, and the smile on her pale lips was full of an immense unchildish misery and sorrowful appeal.
0xbfc7dfb86b64b0c6734b4f8c3dc26672ac1fdb54 svidrigaïlov knew that girl; there was no holy image, no burning candle beside the coffin; no sound of prayers: the girl had drowned herself.
0x79230d270fc9dfd7b23d6d64c1bef145c0f5ec9b she was only fourteen, but her heart was broken.
0xeaba613c9fe859d4410ae19c127846014f0dd0c9 and she had destroyed herself, crushed by an insult that had appalled and amazed that childish soul, had smirched that angel purity with unmerited disgrace and torn from her a last scream of despair, unheeded and brutally disregarded, on a dark night in the cold and wet while the wind howled.... svidrigaïlov came to himself, got up from the bed and went to the window.
0x3f97826b0ad6bf1f49c2a9aee5fcf8f492b918a3 he felt for the latch and opened it.
0x82461899e5813da57a45008dab9963d2a69ab87a the wind lashed furiously into the little room and stung his face and his chest, only covered with his shirt, as though with frost.
0x24377ac8ea3a4a83d679493b99c5fda81c497499 under the window there must have been something like a garden, and apparently a pleasure garden.
0x65cddb4ca5b5238c5d99f627682361bd25bd504f there, too, probably there were tea-tables and singing in the daytime.
0x8aafcb1a4d6621b9dc260dfe85beb31d8ac7b479 now drops of rain flew in at the window from the trees and bushes; it was dark as in a cellar, so that he could only just make out some dark blurs of objects.
0x9dffdb0df08a8da80e4284654b31ef5cfdae87f8 svidrigaïlov, bending down with elbows on the window-sill, gazed for five minutes into the darkness; the boom of a cannon, followed by a second one, resounded in the darkness of the night.
0x44f66153333f06e88c75041bdddee00e5ce307a6 “ah, the signal!
0xe0425f49c672c2eeab6aa1a479920cb9688a7ede the river is overflowing,” he thought.
0x9d507e70d10c38bb5ae4f55ca6b812cef05b7ee6 “by morning it will be swirling down the street in the lower parts, flooding the basements and cellars.
0x341cd07a359bbe520a1910bb60c27bc034a60579 the cellar rats will swim out, and men will curse in the rain and wind as they drag their rubbish to their upper storeys.
0x628cb760f0273ea489d82f70f4bff2b4fdf03dc7 what time is it now?”
0x7d510aec99a47de935725f4460454e351d0f526b and he had hardly thought it when, somewhere near, a clock on the wall, ticking away hurriedly, struck three.
0xb99434b084f38a12fc7caf419f4da437c77b21c2 “aha!
0x832e5902215f2aee49cf706a53e94b8d7d555284 it will be light in an hour!
0x4108ca0a1bcb1bf1efb58082a904a524efb3b8e4 why wait?
0xea384a72ea631af847d3694e8d89e0579828663f i’ll go out at once straight to the park.
0x93ae9ebe337dcc089e45fb04ca8252d351bee3d7 i’ll choose a great bush there drenched with rain, so that as soon as one’s shoulder touches it, millions of drops drip on one’s head.”
0x7f309b20c197c2fa09750f680f0bfff4fc64fdbd he moved away from the window, shut it, lighted the candle, put on his waistcoat, his overcoat and his hat and went out, carrying the candle, into the passage to look for the ragged attendant who would be asleep somewhere in the midst of candle-ends and all sorts of rubbish, to pay him for the room and leave the hotel.
0xa38a368b94d6d1d8945affbb45bd530e0e89d3aa “it’s the best minute; i couldn’t choose a better.”
0x3ce61068080cc7407b58d469ed30b312f027c0fd he walked for some time through a long narrow corridor without finding anyone and was just going to call out, when suddenly in a dark corner between an old cupboard and the door he caught sight of a strange object which seemed to be alive.
0x2c4a03e31f19d0d8744bf918e396227be91fa3ba he bent down with the candle and saw a little girl, not more than five years old, shivering and crying, with her clothes as wet as a soaking house-flannel.
0x381f8f7a13175fb0d65682afeb70558c0f2bc566 she did not seem afraid of svidrigaïlov, but looked at him with blank amazement out of her big black eyes.
0x3c9ca41506505f081ffbc7bb2050b894542fb4a8 now and then she sobbed as children do when they have been crying a long time, but are beginning to be comforted.
0x2098221c83ae5dea14471732599efa9e94668a1e the child’s face was pale and tired, she was numb with cold.
0x5691e2aac45f12bcaaa351623d92623a6b4059e0 “how can she have come here?
0x9b42d97c970f33aeea251ee72899951f63936cc6 she must have hidden here and not slept all night.”
0xf0558f43dd697d8528e23b2b672b5f818fdbc897 he began questioning her.
0x47a9e68256421064d0a31b6b4ef05910ad82f788 the child suddenly becoming animated, chattered away in her baby language, something about “mammy” and that “mammy would beat her,” and about some cup that she had “bwoken.”
0xd72a532f3eb89beba60e5ab067271d5c0722ebd2 the child chattered on without stopping.
0xdb854bd43b52245bda58d0470deb937f11340374 he could only guess from what she said that she was a neglected child, whose mother, probably a drunken cook, in the service of the hotel, whipped and frightened her; that the child had broken a cup of her mother’s and was so frightened that she had run away the evening before, had hidden for a long while somewhere outside in the rain, at last had made her way in here, hidden behind the cupboard and spent the night there, crying and trembling from the damp, the darkness and the fear that she would be badly beaten for it.
0xe28a3faddaae8e4f5dc5127d74a07da37d716574 he took her in his arms, went back to his room, sat her on the bed, and began undressing her.
0x587dbf1f269c1bf2ff214e8cb66e9c01ebf3ee48 the torn shoes which she had on her stockingless feet were as wet as if they had been standing in a puddle all night.
0xeed4cc53feef98a62f1782f9e6a94be2f728dc1f when he had undressed her, he put her on the bed, covered her up and wrapped her in the blanket from her head downwards.
0x91732143fb71491373123891e46b4d28250b2c39 she fell asleep at once.
0xe2b480e3a3204f310d7d68572cb5db5c3bd583b8 then he sank into dreary musing again.
0x8ea9504fec2faa72201a8e9149702dda081b4e9d “what folly to trouble myself,” he decided suddenly with an oppressive feeling of annoyance.
0xce49e6bb00eddfb53971f4205c2cd6320912e87c “what idiocy!”
0x454f049f93d3601480b0914383bf9740a9914dc0 in vexation he took up the candle to go and look for the ragged attendant again and make haste to go away.
0x8c65b9704abc2d97ca7b4dbbee8445bc68ec60d4 “damn the child!”
0x0f915f8f3baecc3f50e01d6695358accc7b0ad98 he thought as he opened the door, but he turned again to see whether the child was asleep.
0x2a9820796904b1facca9056ab46a9103fe98d32e he raised the blanket carefully.
0xe11fd984cec49c26f38977c8721a309135ede901 the child was sleeping soundly, she had got warm under the blanket, and her pale cheeks were flushed.
0x9fe4d650d3bc5584d7b9ee6a45210a1a5bfff759 but strange to say that flush seemed brighter and coarser than the rosy cheeks of childhood.
0x2139e7db5111d710a3ec44497d415bf73347f024 “it’s a flush of fever,” thought svidrigaïlov.
0xdaab38808b6dbc4672e68fe8e63a42960f3bebca it was like the flush from drinking, as though she had been given a full glass to drink.
0x4f5aa306a362bc8f557f7a9d9f8301d5b9b9e7dc her crimson lips were hot and glowing; but what was this?
0x8ee45a83a1e49b0d0ee4e8aa415fba26021c5dd9 he suddenly fancied that her long black eyelashes were quivering, as though the lids were opening and a sly crafty eye peeped out with an unchildlike wink, as though the little girl were not asleep, but pretending.
0xd8bfa5e7b999b10094f85b5d3746d6a55eeea9e8 yes, it was so.
0xe40d19a54ef4014e430d446a81abfaf2797bad4c her lips parted in a smile.
0x647916e1d86630d5e6823a108435388ad40b2fdf the corners of her mouth quivered, as though she were trying to control them.
0x04e16087e1f3dea0abb043bc8709d53226f5866c but now she quite gave up all effort, now it was a grin, a broad grin; there was something shameless, provocative in that quite unchildish face; it was depravity, it was the face of a harlot, the shameless face of a french harlot.
0x5ad7e2508db4b9a224ad88fb87fa0b1cd41d820d now both eyes opened wide; they turned a glowing, shameless glance upon him; they laughed, invited him.... there was something infinitely hideous and shocking in that laugh, in those eyes, in such nastiness in the face of a child.
0xf7948346742d9890a999aa5ef97ce02c5111ffe2 “what, at five years old?”
0x3940df2bec7fb3d6febeaff64fec84c64b70f878 svidrigaïlov muttered in genuine horror.
0xec01ea0399f5b469c61a970801d725c7d31ec2e1 “what does it mean?”
0xdaabf7ac6e73c06a51e9a20a4828c9f5cffbbb2f and now she turned to him, her little face all aglow, holding out her arms.... “accursed child!”
0x3ad8a9b30268a2c96f6fec4b897586586eec4962 svidrigaïlov cried, raising his hand to strike her, but at that moment he woke up.
0xf88d540f6f7895ecd30e2db070fd3cbacc7c27f0 he was in the same bed, still wrapped in the blanket.
0x855b5bbd1e91586f155ef35b0ba013239815b7ab the candle had not been lighted, and daylight was streaming in at the windows.
0xf3012e06dd33394369cffc358f02897275c5b99b “i’ve had nightmare all night!”
0x7d09f195e98a22c89fdf08c54888143d76d93759 he got up angrily, feeling utterly shattered; his bones ached.
0x28de1e36feea5d7c40bfa48f06ba5ca740783dec there was a thick mist outside and he could see nothing.
0x55a2d7a763ab31cca03b563d7e38fcd571209bcb it was nearly five.
0x401626b489397781f8b3dc09eb5e5b8902294e37 he had overslept himself!
0xb4146b9de88d18803188e1b2b3ec21b685540662 he got up, put on his still damp jacket and overcoat.
0x5a5a1c05bf7664126c930403383d73f58945735a feeling the revolver in his pocket, he took it out and then he sat down, took a notebook out of his pocket and in the most conspicuous place on the title page wrote a few lines in large letters.
0x5543a4bb0a5356ad1dce7518efc3e1ee0807526d reading them over, he sank into thought with his elbows on the table.
0xfbe08b4643301d871e2bb2fb91f8566687bfe827 the revolver and the notebook lay beside him.
0x893f9565d3e16ec62171ab15f94da5418026feae some flies woke up and settled on the untouched veal, which was still on the table.
0xa7736a4b3000ba1a267a5b70b562b566bd48e72e he stared at them and at last with his free right hand began trying to catch one.
0x8a40c6142832eef9ff1cdc4958d4d662b5b35c6f he tried till he was tired, but could not catch it.
0x8634026da838e3f503ffcf1649e9a99905aad376 at last, realising that he was engaged in this interesting pursuit, he started, got up and walked resolutely out of the room.
0xbf4c6931905cddcf94d10e51e30c9ae57bd79d61 a minute later he was in the street.
0x803b6597ae12e1f8b7e911a8bee459aeb71ce671 a thick milky mist hung over the town.
0x26e4347be107bcb4bcb8f1c998e8f2dbab05f2d0 svidrigaïlov walked along the slippery dirty wooden pavement towards the little neva.
0x89f9e551ca49981d6087edf6489428f48120f066 he was picturing the waters of the little neva swollen in the night, petrovsky island, the wet paths, the wet grass, the wet trees and bushes and at last the bush.... he began ill-humouredly staring at the houses, trying to think of something else.
0x694d08c459f25c25e8439b23b7a1aab5aefffbd3 there was not a cabman or a passer-by in the street.
0x9332b4f2ab8a2f21daff389ccbd3f10c330fbad8 the bright yellow, wooden, little houses looked dirty and dejected with their closed shutters.
0xb8d90fe2e2b1f01198fdc130010e6869c0e9362e the cold and damp penetrated his whole body and he began to shiver.
0xe68afbd0ecf14704f4a3b839d4b18d3533a20fd1 from time to time he came across shop signs and read each carefully.
0xb64a4dee53da1a35e869d5d706c3c58c99396816 at last he reached the end of the wooden pavement and came to a big stone house.
0x8cbd69d9e9fcb1936302a1c965adc16edf291b26 a dirty, shivering dog crossed his path with its tail between its legs.
0x4270d911a87318aa3695e553017b6b7be2929312 a man in a greatcoat lay face downwards; dead drunk, across the pavement.
0x36d0d3b43c8fdc33c5359491ba92aa75a7828338 he looked at him and went on.
0xc25a82c1715da856a2a0b7cf69f7e05de2e61f49 a high tower stood up on the left.
0x7cdf4195e6dad9ee9cf92383de99e23c66822570 “bah!”
0x6a21c6559e5ef63af4cdb3e9a5479fef185e8108 he shouted, “here is a place.
0x3f36a50f6bb5a865de54033f93b4c763c060b072 why should it be petrovsky?
0x73601aca25f3953f194dca5ebe1d1de5c26d1bd4 it will be in the presence of an official witness anyway....” he almost smiled at this new thought and turned into the street where there was the big house with the tower.
0x501c96d51d219065b7a321842e36482f801f7800 at the great closed gates of the house, a little man stood with his shoulder leaning against them, wrapped in a grey soldier’s coat, with a copper achilles helmet on his head.
0x77bab600a80275377eea0ed8fdb8561e7c955596 he cast a drowsy and indifferent glance at svidrigaïlov.
0xd7fe0f59f6708f7f0330cf4bad7ebaca0905ddbc his face wore that perpetual look of peevish dejection, which is so sourly printed on all faces of jewish race without exception.
0xdbff06c97a758a7fd24801e9de79de698a8c7aec they both, svidrigaïlov and achilles, stared at each other for a few minutes without speaking.
0x4f1e0464d9dde0c50ab762d7bf9b920b4793d18e at last it struck achilles as irregular for a man not drunk to be standing three steps from him, staring and not saying a word.
0xdf7d24bc81b87d6cfcf3f452b6c30cc463e3cfa1 “what do you want here?”
0xb433bfb159b65f530f682ae85e612d63fc18dadd he said, without moving or changing his position.
0xd421af68bac226d0f9b70179c217f01da946000c “nothing, brother, good morning,” answered svidrigaïlov.
0xe7acd2e04917bca3bf9488d2ba56a534d31acc8b “this isn’t the place.”
0x4df24bb0dde3b2ccfdf7b370d30892f966dc15f2 “i am going to foreign parts, brother.”
0xc65e033b908833785da52f4469df766040575f19 “to foreign parts?”
0xe2ed9a12bba5f7ad1c2fee458e843c9a64559cd1 “to america.”
0x45cc8a798eabb29ae2f0ac4d503b5907a833484f “america.”
0xae0d23fe4f6b4326acc805964cd664aa01bec5e1 svidrigaïlov took out the revolver and cocked it.
0x0604499e36eb902913731df75f10d1eb01455f90 achilles raised his eyebrows.
0x749fd2912842155459acfc60862c4bd436d3d719 “i say, this is not the place for such jokes!”
0xe1ef24fa06bad1316d13b8392c63993a236393af “why shouldn’t it be the place?”
0xd2d5bc71f3d2f81df8e424c1ddb7774da207d74f “because it isn’t.”
0x141ea7dea718f75ed22c1e500e6a4d5bfbb0db1a “well, brother, i don’t mind that.
0xbf2ad2754625f7163366ea8f5bcd8769e75f7622 it’s a good place.
0x547c5d12e8887388c46317e6e079fbd87aa92f99 when you are asked, you just say he was going, he said, to america.”
0xfcf07d3d2546b2bdf43fd6bfa67b67708f47b247 he put the revolver to his right temple.
0xfc8d3fbcf7621790a830571af4cbb8d4f91112c1 “you can’t do it here, it’s not the place,” cried achilles, rousing himself, his eyes growing bigger and bigger.
0x1d9773909b121243aa7184250bb2d7fe5ade5702 svidrigaïlov pulled the trigger.
0x9495486047cabd2bd0f428003933f74a66e1d5fd chapter vii the same day, about seven o’clock in the evening, raskolnikov was on his way to his mother’s and sister’s lodging--the lodging in bakaleyev’s house which razumihin had found for them.
0xbf2c4c13365e06df53ff78fc215abddde365e43b the stairs went up from the street.
0xd1c29d8d308e34b367465913d923bf104fb4bc52 raskolnikov walked with lagging steps, as though still hesitating whether to go or not.
0x824feb39855f3ea0e60e0c44eefaf1eda0f77afd but nothing would have turned him back: his decision was taken.
0x02c14d3eeb775dd7a866dbd0ca9a99a6c6910fe7 “besides, it doesn’t matter, they still know nothing,” he thought, “and they are used to thinking of me as eccentric.”
0xe55d5250ba4aa9b712a3b43097155c769498639d he was appallingly dressed: his clothes torn and dirty, soaked with a night’s rain.
0x14f6f995e7b42b54b932e5121a366c4fda1c5732 his face was almost distorted from fatigue, exposure, the inward conflict that had lasted for twenty-four hours.
0xc06166a4af1254c81d7fb23c6a6185c903b9e29f he had spent all the previous night alone, god knows where.
0x4ea5b6b64f3852682ad2cc308a80cf69b7d0056a but anyway he had reached a decision.
0x50eb0783d6fa2644956b8630739f5d7da35dcf51 he knocked at the door which was opened by his mother.
0xc1a9afe828e3f8d3b317cf1ad7cef9eea60b64f6 dounia was not at home.
0xf0011114d4ce0f6b32e3c9817e0cbf61eb649c22 even the servant happened to be out.
0xabd4eb969c19d7453cc7ddf62e79432207064c50 at first pulcheria alexandrovna was speechless with joy and surprise; then she took him by the hand and drew him into the room.

0x48d80204d84a7fddebce731770182bd623fadafb she began, faltering with joy.
0x883af0f9a2baf6d27154e8aa10eb47d5654c06bc “don’t be angry with me, rodya, for welcoming you so foolishly with tears: i am laughing not crying.

0x60d880bd8b86c28ce1e8197c6300f4a6b8d9c4de raskolnikov took the magazine and glanced at his article.
0xf66f9cad6b6e4c39c31fde03cb3996c5b82be247 incongruous as it was with his mood and his circumstances, he felt that strange and bitter sweet sensation that every author experiences the first time he sees himself in print; besides, he was only twenty-three.
0x34e7b041a3fba61edfc0424bacb935b90934fd22 it lasted only a moment.

0x42ab1f2752593c5be139e5054938d79e267635fb and dounia, dounia was all but believing it--what do you say to that?
0x1bf1f68039d0d03173711c20bc0fb963740c0151 your father sent twice to magazines--the first time poems (i’ve got the manuscript and will show you) and the second time a whole novel (i begged him to let me copy it out) and how we prayed that they should be taken--they weren’t!
0x0e4a495327322140b4047da8eefd2a266b5e975d i was breaking my heart, rodya, six or seven days ago over your food and your clothes and the way you are living.
0x2bc7dc9dfb6d36d989ec4e3c67dd09919e97eb3b but now i see again how foolish i was, for you can attain any position you like by your intellect and talent.
0xbae88b35e5a3166f94ed2847b3bfd4b8ce19ee68 no doubt you don’t care about that for the present and you are occupied with much more important matters....” “dounia’s not at home, mother?”
0x68ba2ba78558f8ddc9d5623086cff09d714f6b38 “no, rodya.
0x50f6a2f8759415a9d644436162321ab16989a5d7 i often don’t see her; she leaves me alone.
0xc3c23b80a00c792b7b5fea3831f433101d4482e9 dmitri prokofitch comes to see me, it’s so good of him, and he always talks about you.
0x60cd28066d9996de458a67c9c1c65566ce7aba8a he loves you and respects you, my dear.
0xe215386f3320f8c901833860ebfd0efb818621c1 i don’t say that dounia is very wanting in consideration.
0x7a07f8cc39f990a551502702a175f6e676d89f27 i am not complaining.
0xf1403e73f2a5cc8284f9675eca8aca5723ef888d she has her ways and i have mine; she seems to have got some secrets of late and i never have any secrets from you two.

0x4937a2d6f7dbbd72ea6d3b7db68b08d7be0898d3 you’ve made me so happy by coming now, rodya, but she has missed you by going out; when she comes in i’ll tell her: ‘your brother came in while you were out.
0xece8e81f76a7732935daeca445129b772e8dfc8e where have you been all this time?’
0x02dcc743137b9bdb1f5f7af39dafd46208bb3762 you mustn’t spoil me, rodya, you know; come when you can, but if you can’t, it doesn’t matter, i can wait.
0xb56bf97b63bc81188c76b4264cd726f604d423cd i shall know, anyway, that you are fond of me, that will be enough for me.

0xc7062d74ff43112a7ffa48d1dc605858446dc013 here you’ve come now to comfort your mother, i see that.”
0x135488f2ae60d49fd9fc2a76ad176465f2f21981 here pulcheria alexandrovna began to cry.

0x6af7ed6be7a854b00e0e65e35788554a11f4ade0 she cried, jumping up.

0x344653cb0b82fa91a22f4ab9c6f7373085508665 “mother, don’t trouble, i am going at once.

0x436f3c6c6776b5c492b67ad51e6648861b6e7723 please listen to me.”
0x42108ac96a05d967ba1d75011dfd43b63dd2edfa pulcheria alexandrovna went up to him timidly.
0xb342480ab98bd44888670b7c6cd0d54e757d6a26 “mother, whatever happens, whatever you hear about me, whatever you are told about me, will you always love me as you do now?”
0xf09038d4a1ae021d52f579630547eac7e1b4938a he asked suddenly from the fullness of his heart, as though not thinking of his words and not weighing them.
0x7e6df26ab96c6237809b7793b9aeecd0cf427ce3 “rodya, rodya, what is the matter?
0xec726e5e10ed587ff944d3b686b7f107bd01c00a how can you ask me such a question?
0xd12e42f7dbe6a3f2eed128c7340780848a715504 why, who will tell me anything about you?
0x3ba84d382207e3fa7767737a180d1cd6c0dfb9bc besides, i shouldn’t believe anyone, i should refuse to listen.”
0x7c819d2514ce3ff940be5140b9993aa1246ea2de “i’ve come to assure you that i’ve always loved you and i am glad that we are alone, even glad dounia is out,” he went on with the same impulse.
0x6dcb9dccffe7504d07edca60ff4e59d000216a80 “i have come to tell you that though you will be unhappy, you must believe that your son loves you now more than himself, and that all you thought about me, that i was cruel and didn’t care about you, was all a mistake.
0x78c9cf1c0a5335c0e46d71c7399f2a5c2206ccbb i shall never cease to love you.... well, that’s enough: i thought i must do this and begin with this....” pulcheria alexandrovna embraced him in silence, pressing him to her bosom and weeping gently.
0xd18c69abca475f595dbd921b3b17f09b3ee6b0d9 “i don’t know what is wrong with you, rodya,” she said at last.
0x2648aefb587a8704cf760a35a659f4dcfd12a392 “i’ve been thinking all this time that we were simply boring you and now i see that there is a great sorrow in store for you, and that’s why you are miserable.
0xf2609d88ef183e292fff73e54aca66de508ee4c4 i’ve foreseen it a long time, rodya.
0x46f26e05bfef9d19f838e80467658599dd2f557e forgive me for speaking about it.
0x89743e52506a1ebd3102093bdcd7131e28b49a3e i keep thinking about it and lie awake at nights.
0xc458524d2f0a39bf68d00c6446b1eb95b16e0ed2 your sister lay talking in her sleep all last night, talking of nothing but you.
0x26f6efd4891b06cdca640d0114d3b142c528ac97 i caught something, but i couldn’t make it out.
0xcc7656e4bc0f33c289568ac73f8e30dc2ab2fe53 i felt all the morning as though i were going to be hanged, waiting for something, expecting something, and now it has come!
0x4b774b2724a29eab943cc994763e0cd0a1d945b9 rodya, rodya, where are you going?
0x294cdc7875d2a9633c9819ad05d2d987029fe6f5 you are going away somewhere?”
0xa00f66ccca0a0d5e24a747fa3544a07776ae36a4 “yes.”
0xcec056963959695549d39d07765936198d3e241e “that’s what i thought!
0x94ae7c887c25cbad098d3a54556ec3bc35ffa903 i can come with you, you know, if you need me.
0x4869e8cb4c0488f396ea307fc46ae1f1d3c98cbb and dounia, too; she loves you, she loves you dearly--and sofya semyonovna may come with us if you like.
0x37363c8ef0a483a02c5badf436410fa65b426f8d you see, i am glad to look upon her as a daughter even... dmitri prokofitch will help us to go together.
0xdb20f037e308aae605e0e6e8351ec6fe7e3396ad but... where... are you going?”
0x5031613c265d4f3b8e40250fe0bce9eb63823095 “good-bye, mother.”
0x73d4e08c5d05da3d1ae0459370352ba87abd6d23 “what, to-day?”
0x9e6033a5ddd886c73c9adeca2215a62c1690b103 she cried, as though losing him for ever.
0xfdfaedc0a85d02d0c604e41c5ea96d7cefa43d39 “i can’t stay, i must go now....” “and can’t i come with you?”
0xe86273a84658eed22b083e69f38ea92ea0d9b310 “no, but kneel down and pray to god for me.
0x9c12b774fae2f71849e762cfcc05b1ab3e9d9e25 your prayer perhaps will reach him.”
0x278a67af7dbe67166b30ad9729d9d0274236b2d5 “let me bless you and sign you with the cross.
0x5bd3eb96000612d39c25754b3848415356737f3c that’s right, that’s right.
0x900cf37013e219db3e498645813fccc7510470b3 oh, god, what are we doing?”
0xcbbcbc47180660fb6abd605c73d7d63a618bd048 yes, he was glad, he was very glad that there was no one there, that he was alone with his mother.
0xa4c56d58522fb7882e3c4a4497d94e272740909d for the first time after all those awful months his heart was softened.
0xfa56e191cab111228cb450db9811855b10f78f90 he fell down before her, he kissed her feet and both wept, embracing.
0xd318007636c882096f0e010ee79732a34e042df3 and she was not surprised and did not question him this time.
0x9468ce94329b44ee21fba8e73697e5d4dc77a14d for some days she had realised that something awful was happening to her son and that now some terrible minute had come for him.
0xf97e13d8cf5b47bcd5072cdb3b9ad62a21d6ae5c “rodya, my darling, my first born,” she said sobbing, “now you are just as when you were little.
0xa16cd0beae0fbd6fd91e42143788d4ea5be6eba0 you would run like this to me and hug me and kiss me.
0x5c99569ecd8d657ebe25f3bb07ee2310b304a730 when your father was living and we were poor, you comforted us simply by being with us and when i buried your father, how often we wept together at his grave and embraced, as now.
0x8685b963e7bed4280c55c86cbe54dfd046bff738 and if i’ve been crying lately, it’s that my mother’s heart had a foreboding of trouble.
0xadb74a061419b24b0341eb1aa85245c83a58556f the first time i saw you, that evening, you remember, as soon as we arrived here, i guessed simply from your eyes.
0x7cb8749929b8e0c14cae43e52717ca6441111780 my heart sank at once, and to-day when i opened the door and looked at you, i thought the fatal hour had come.
0xc32ac3ce7045877217a6c7af3ac3e549d19117ec rodya, rodya, you are not going away to-day?”
0x32ce54f56b31b99cecad1f8c6aef54fb2300a200 “no!”
0xd19bebf79942a9b4790c585f183eb5ab9d46c95f “you’ll come again?”
0xeffdd074d0936be7b947dadb8148bddc3951122e “yes... i’ll come.”
0xfbd80bfbd4c0e70f06428503401f7d75155a8e3d “rodya, don’t be angry, i don’t dare to question you.
0xd8f758d10f6bfa359769d7e1782596f699e26462 i know i mustn’t.
0xc69f056078599d5b46bdf9ef06ef895bd513b96d only say two words to me--is it far where you are going?”
0x10666091713d91dea0b189e3a5ed743e48393b45 “very far.”
0x6e5edb26ab1b2063d9b67174c3515357bb0486bc “what is awaiting you there?
0x157b47821ba5d523570d839c5457aa283692a2f0 some post or career for you?”
0xc59886e5eda8ae42d18cb542045d3ca618362cfe “what god sends... only pray for me.”
0x2a6a4f2a31e5a5eef08f1e68c22f6c72b2774626 raskolnikov went to the door, but she clutched him and gazed despairingly into his eyes.
0x211aac54202c5909d3b7a06f2c0f30028bb48d0f her face worked with terror.
0xfb63db5a44b8a5d67f3d43689a8160b53620a1ed “enough, mother,” said raskolnikov, deeply regretting that he had come.
0x4e40fafb89bdaa568e6e321779a27aaba47f906c “not for ever, it’s not yet for ever?
0xa12bea9b71a32559cae2d33cd19f462e7468ea9e you’ll come, you’ll come to-morrow?”
0xdeebd448ba72b514f5e7163ded94df45d0acffdd “i will, i will, good-bye.”
0x5cd80675c9500015f747d9034c656acb892ae852 he tore himself away at last.
0x2e9fec240b4c498767a6e098bf98be3b99971be5 it was a warm, fresh, bright evening; it had cleared up in the morning.
0xcc8be03ba6f63fea98e7bf0b53c10eb1fee5d7aa raskolnikov went to his lodgings; he made haste.
0xc80651397ca4baa0ec062e095725d42b0e5f1d77 he wanted to finish all before sunset.
0x63133719df60dccda50870ab94d7edf4e6af8257 he did not want to meet anyone till then.
0xbbb6e2f4f53ed5d56331a7aa8b96ebc1ccd7f951 going up the stairs he noticed that nastasya rushed from the samovar to watch him intently.
0xdc99dafa15627688cf440a40b719acbdf43adc1f “can anyone have come to see me?”
0x8a3862288ad1641200aaede1f31af715a8339768 he wondered.
0xedb80b39ccbbe8292454431100eab38fb90460cd he had a disgusted vision of porfiry.
0xfbba21b1613d3ebec56260181b5ae890520df6aa but opening his door he saw dounia.
0xfab2f56309142f2f85daf62b71bc5812eabb0d90 she was sitting alone, plunged in deep thought, and looked as though she had been waiting a long time.
0xc06474bfdeb3829552031061bfc77f37968d9675 he stopped short in the doorway.
0xe4de15da123f3b84254d99ea1ba9e15e678a4964 she rose from the sofa in dismay and stood up facing him.
0xb4a4a5bf49124adee0957fafc711ddb8324895f6 her eyes, fixed upon him, betrayed horror and infinite grief.
0xa90dc6c99df85f5ab9ac49a0b3b6da43e08c562f and from those eyes alone he saw at once that she knew.
0xb46df1e5aba908107a9734f8b8aac0fc9763aaa5 “am i to come in or go away?”
0xe10de69a7ce5b7059b71b77023c47d812fc1ed8e he asked uncertainly.
0xfdb24dc1ac35387ddf7cb68b262cf6e433df8031 “i’ve been all day with sofya semyonovna.
0xf4c8525907ca7d72f601c58ef147841222eb8fd0 we were both waiting for you.
0x39a5289a2b9807fdfb84efdd7bbce69caa638158 we thought that you would be sure to come there.”
0x5bda6ea83337b64f1f7f0dc3f9355bf18305bbbb raskolnikov went into the room and sank exhausted on a chair.
0x0cc36058b24905a8442dd3cb8c214dcd9cf4892f “i feel weak, dounia, i am very tired; and i should have liked at this moment to be able to control myself.”
0xb6e9168f4f851fd4e81cc86c032c57e3ec1f44fc he glanced at her mistrustfully.
0x25da81163c01fbf997b76e21deb3c3920ec11b11 “where were you all night?”
0xa0d6d1e05e2fd83ecae7ea1393a1f5ad9dcd17ba “i don’t remember clearly.
0x15fe97c28d106f12e3e10131cece3d8d919df3ef you see, sister, i wanted to make up my mind once for all, and several times i walked by the neva, i remember that i wanted to end it all there, but... i couldn’t make up my mind,” he whispered, looking at her mistrustfully again.
0x5c8b7fa110ede60ce9cd94eaa2cb423567693c39 “thank god!
0x886a2f53819edc26aa78b45ebc364fc079e0eb6b that was just what we were afraid of, sofya semyonovna and i. then you still have faith in life?
0x034aa8ff967ea3e72b1981931949cdaf881e6311 thank god, thank god!”
0x1a04730e50c1bea0545fedd36c507bb29202a7f0 raskolnikov smiled bitterly.
0x4f70955f1e53b3b89c394f37eb3be73949bdfd56 “i haven’t faith, but i have just been weeping in mother’s arms; i haven’t faith, but i have just asked her to pray for me.
0x71e7d23b7e23a4330d5ddf20fc32713edaba45a9 i don’t know how it is, dounia, i don’t understand it.”
0x5d0e3a087a86cb2ad391bb24280332660b439895 “have you been at mother’s?
0xc6f910e5377adc4f29e60d50b9ca8ae885662fac have you told her?”
0x79aa58ce14bf3f29233860f5ff92af4cc61b582f cried dounia, horror-stricken.
0x9e9724f409e2ea496fdef8b27bf57a44792ebe39 “surely you haven’t done that?”
0x30cf3550eed0418a04a82c67aee525dd9ad28248 “no, i didn’t tell her... in words; but she understood a great deal.
0xc0fdb6576df254e0026e1e3dafd41be29ab42fad she heard you talking in your sleep.
0x125527a94cd9bb919b1e346a6563185becca38e6 i am sure she half understands it already.
0xdffb89c4c4c97d7dd7d74ff729c1b566eb0c5715 perhaps i did wrong in going to see her.
0x4b50a26a25b8506e4a181907c24bb6bcf22dbb53 i don’t know why i did go.
0xaf525b4a4782e121f9852dee2f326b2b0da3f70c i am a contemptible person, dounia.”
0xe55907f75f325a20965d53b9440863d276e2bb60 “a contemptible person, but ready to face suffering!
0xaf8a6e9626dde95cd88b87bd92f747b61a286566 you are, aren’t you?”
0xbdd2323635e7e8093d2ddaa89b5ae79bcd35018c “yes, i am going.

0xc60f770679d29a017244f43430ad97055a1412a8 yes, to escape the disgrace i thought of drowning myself, dounia, but as i looked into the water, i thought that if i had considered myself strong till now i’d better not be afraid of disgrace,” he said, hurrying on.
0xb87cb0a40790b07ddbbc715da7a73f25658a44e7 “it’s pride, dounia.”
0xf78afe5cade231051751384677ff01aca62cbb0e “pride, rodya.”
0x9094dab29dcde09b0789f9a4a07deea7a0612bf6 there was a gleam of fire in his lustreless eyes; he seemed to be glad to think that he was still proud.
0x4534f418256c262d3c00ac0f0315a0b5937f6e77 “you don’t think, sister, that i was simply afraid of the water?”
0xc78490e806f9faaa16955dd4589637be4698449c he asked, looking into her face with a sinister smile.
0xa16de7843234d19bc3fb939a7d96c896952450fc “oh, rodya, hush!”
0xdb6366e8c660924ca39348dde1b9ef0b10c3f5dd cried dounia bitterly.
0xf11a69fa2feb7b9a4c0522f1d6140fb0abf23c0f silence lasted for two minutes.
0x38a7a74b23904b99b9db9b3882923f3b460f261a he sat with his eyes fixed on the floor; dounia stood at the other end of the table and looked at him with anguish.
0xd6dbc8a857f349d4eaa7615e6da09ba1a9472049 suddenly he got up.
0x98efdc23d61027ba61e78e0c4325ea74cbd4b306 “it’s late, it’s time to go!
0x6317060191425f35caf2127dbcfdb88474b242be i am going at once to give myself up.
0xe732e82f807d0d012d7ed372ee9eea86bc8875ff but i don’t know why i am going to give myself up.”
0x8f81ac34707b248e1e85d0742408d365f4921c98 big tears fell down her cheeks.
0xdaebde6b97f7add04f67a8134b84a1358bb6d4f4 “you are crying, sister, but can you hold out your hand to me?”
0x348c511df6c1f284099fd41f6dcd09a480e5b235 “you doubted it?”
0x9a0f211c08648881d1463eb46862643f15101e84 she threw her arms round him.
0xa92a7cb08b50de33231e0af8b9a7f5f393fa9335 “aren’t you half expiating your crime by facing the suffering?”
0x737ede7781b1f5824788a9551d14b5ae74bec323 she cried, holding him close and kissing him.
0xf6c598acdb17267778f62a3dedbfbd7f925d979b “crime?
0x29f8ea03dd46813aa834e2eab7165622eb21c607 what crime?”
0x520976d75672a4ce52626b6f5ce0380e789010eb he cried in sudden fury.
0xf417cc87c06a1d2476ff5f9d0d6c5096fbcaa058 “that i killed a vile noxious insect, an old pawnbroker woman, of use to no one!... killing her was atonement for forty sins.
0xe420cf67ff2773a18ff8a2e0b655f39295ac0635 she was sucking the life out of poor people.
0x0fd328110e8d226631d56b6df0e6a23d368e352a was that a crime?
0xe118605d870190610daea288578463d9b142f271 i am not thinking of it and i am not thinking of expiating it, and why are you all rubbing it in on all sides?
0x17309d162fb98d8933a030d388f1290a4f018a32 ‘a crime!
0x030bb5ca817e2b2fb78231b12bbbe75c46949e38 a crime!’
0xed3fc968a686e3541a315fb7b3df12d7045c88ca only now i see clearly the imbecility of my cowardice, now that i have decided to face this superfluous disgrace.
0xdbaace7f3c4db15fc4f27e7f4e2b27da8729490c it’s simply because i am contemptible and have nothing in me that i have decided to, perhaps too for my advantage, as that... porfiry... suggested!”
0x195eb82137b22a41f42b1b075f32e0c186602130 “brother, brother, what are you saying?
0xc9b6782b7dde5105b5ff7e9c4f070b0f82b08167 why, you have shed blood?”
0x3309623c2083a63d8b3c8f7593b88246d9de0513 cried dounia in despair.
0x564001d26dcbbfd54c190a7a9e7d3259fe09cad2 “which all men shed,” he put in almost frantically, “which flows and has always flowed in streams, which is spilt like champagne, and for which men are crowned in the capitol and are called afterwards benefactors of mankind.
0x6002c64beb24320d2ea8802ad2d810f0a3090af3 look into it more carefully and understand it!
0x6af3202b694b31f84ef29ea7ba01715d7eb1f75e i too wanted to do good to men and would have done hundreds, thousands of good deeds to make up for that one piece of stupidity, not stupidity even, simply clumsiness, for the idea was by no means so stupid as it seems now that it has failed.... (everything seems stupid when it fails.)
0x37faea34e2ed6cb0a8993b725debcb87f1432bcc by that stupidity i only wanted to put myself into an independent position, to take the first step, to obtain means, and then everything would have been smoothed over by benefits immeasurable in comparison.... but i... i couldn’t carry out even the first step, because i am contemptible, that’s what’s the matter!
0x5ab6c77ba771c608fa57845d1180d470e4459b20 and yet i won’t look at it as you do.
0xc8e9589e8a80077b63fac05a8c80fe3ab86a8f34 if i had succeeded i should have been crowned with glory, but now i’m trapped.”
0x07c3a0e2ba14c62b289b3b83bf52b9b12263623d “but that’s not so, not so!
0x5685234855767b60aa7133a3ebae3be8e8a15393 brother, what are you saying?”
0x2646af8aaba7d90143ed45446e54191dcaf0c198 “ah, it’s not picturesque, not æsthetically attractive!
0x0cdcb2729d01a7a27fa5e77ebabbf148e5f4dde3 i fail to understand why bombarding people by regular siege is more honourable.
0xb43cc47e0bd921c1696742d9ad0ab3620807b8e2 the fear of appearances is the first symptom of impotence.
0x9338fb0c875420c0a2fdbc7ce3d7743b19986018 i’ve never, never recognised this more clearly than now, and i am further than ever from seeing that what i did was a crime.
0x0a460149d7ca8832e8840e7e7e28f8db952848f6 i’ve never, never been stronger and more convinced than now.”
0x8fc6fb86d8fc682590d4a3367e989c9624e0c36b the colour had rushed into his pale exhausted face, but as he uttered his last explanation, he happened to meet dounia’s eyes and he saw such anguish in them that he could not help being checked.
0xd1901f74f34b0de62dbdf1dbc23d49c425819815 he felt that he had, anyway, made these two poor women miserable, that he was, anyway, the cause... “dounia darling, if i am guilty forgive me (though i cannot be forgiven if i am guilty).
0x5a627d72b3dfe6d38a85b63ac4196af9bffb0613 good-bye!
0x61acbfc1c9d6b9bf41f4a3a0e5f7a60f957ceb45 we won’t dispute.
0x7dc3680f5b1b71c0bb6e67d3d5aa974c7324548d it’s time, high time to go.
0xbf11572f8888631f1631989097234c4674cf7b9f don’t follow me, i beseech you, i have somewhere else to go.... but you go at once and sit with mother.
0x0da07b2b52d4e0737204ed850cab98566f992023 i entreat you to!
0x8792361866a14f730e684d87b4e3162dd5925789 it’s my last request of you.
0x8eba7e933e0b6f38587d6c282246ac36cf36b66c don’t leave her at all; i left her in a state of anxiety, that she is not fit to bear; she will die or go out of her mind.
0x196f2f7904c5d37e90ef6b82acf87e6f59e74740 be with her!
0xd5e259269f03dea466679eeec853d08ca321df19 razumihin will be with you.
0x63a6e78fea3b98cf3804ee6c75be41a83a86a055 i’ve been talking to him.... don’t cry about me: i’ll try to be honest and manly all my life, even if i am a murderer.
0xac4082e91eeec935755e7e413fae6000a85fe8ce perhaps i shall some day make a name.
0x71c280b930063804bc2e16e028cef707a72abd69 i won’t disgrace you, you will see; i’ll still show.... now good-bye for the present,” he concluded hurriedly, noticing again a strange expression in dounia’s eyes at his last words and promises.
0xd8278dbd56f0723e934fac488900710deca014b0 “why are you crying?
0x36a77d12dd582c93a222db34ffdcf3a1662d5e4e don’t cry, don’t cry: we are not parting for ever!
0x422fc808a7d9c28e1df5fbff3f1311ae0cbe91da ah, yes!
0xfcbfe2f0f762ee67da03438051ab46356ae2d379 wait a minute, i’d forgotten!”
0x8f3e242a6da7910636feeb59a318224ee10d0ad6 he went to the table, took up a thick dusty book, opened it and took from between the pages a little water-colour portrait on ivory.
0x067c32443c8fabf886f03b0c981d0e95c2ca3e8d it was the portrait of his landlady’s daughter, who had died of fever, that strange girl who had wanted to be a nun.
0x6ea425dcf27337402f95ae968ab1111c41198864 for a minute he gazed at the delicate expressive face of his betrothed, kissed the portrait and gave it to dounia.
0x606aa9d25b5f4834dd9ce62f32a02898374c3ad3 “i used to talk a great deal about it to her, only to her,” he said thoughtfully.
0x81a4558453de7b8e3e69c04441d3846079994d9b “to her heart i confided much of what has since been so hideously realised.
0xaf503486399e245ece814da692d757b8155129d0 don’t be uneasy,” he returned to dounia, “she was as much opposed to it as you, and i am glad that she is gone.
0x77cf5bc51649ac478bc4b4b727657ad5184b1e06 the great point is that everything now is going to be different, is going to be broken in two,” he cried, suddenly returning to his dejection.
0x7b74286e39318085c516dbd6488d96aa47caee4e “everything, everything, and am i prepared for it?
0x5cb787498820c5622ccf4e7974826dc223469e24 do i want it myself?
0x385a1902989e17b9ea2bca8eccb56561a5a70701 they say it is necessary for me to suffer!
0x509d8f6446f3463ee2138cb0101a4c5281031e41 what’s the object of these senseless sufferings?
0xd6b6a5fbb373f628b9e6f1b8906ee23986ce188c shall i know any better what they are for, when i am crushed by hardships and idiocy, and weak as an old man after twenty years’ penal servitude?
0xbd46b00340f3d254cae650f7db72cba2fda05325 and what shall i have to live for then?
0xfda78e1419c6b1c411d6cdb3f3acbb841ea6a235 why am i consenting to that life now?
0x53fa3bf9fa7bb540fd5f4b467f32303ec4f54d9f oh, i knew i was contemptible when i stood looking at the neva at daybreak to-day!”
0x85752edac48a34d565617f4e54585bb1ef2c1043 at last they both went out.
0x2a1cb1d0e426e07cd1ee90bd1524cd473f7630d9 it was hard for dounia, but she loved him.
0x2a51b7a01278e827c715286255664aab4ec4042b she walked away, but after going fifty paces she turned round to look at him again.
0x99c5dbf4d9182a060ff1ae4f85d7da0f96994325 he was still in sight.
0x67c40bc388291e14c3adbf7297d64eb4daefb4db at the corner he too turned and for the last time their eyes met; but noticing that she was looking at him, he motioned her away with impatience and even vexation, and turned the corner abruptly.
0x20ab8648b2b8475617b0d66053eac3b8aab26c8e “i am wicked, i see that,” he thought to himself, feeling ashamed a moment later of his angry gesture to dounia.
0xbfbbc3fbe55e64c9ac53f8e7b4d5fe4b03715bca “but why are they so fond of me if i don’t deserve it?
0xa8de4d6d86183eba5a54e76a20b528f435e2ef82 oh, if only i were alone and no one loved me and i too had never loved anyone!
0xe607ebe2efdfb7e304c9924df574736722797126 _nothing of all this would have happened._ but i wonder shall i in those fifteen or twenty years grow so meek that i shall humble myself before people and whimper at every word that i am a criminal?
0x3156237d6c0488aaa4084b05a1052123c5b32d00 yes, that’s it, that’s it, that’s what they are sending me there for, that’s what they want.
0x62363feb4a5a72cc66d671f1812e2df2e80770fa look at them running to and fro about the streets, every one of them a scoundrel and a criminal at heart and, worse still, an idiot.
0x1e55df7edf1f275471656c8fec2a89cec530c20c but try to get me off and they’d be wild with righteous indignation.
0x3ebeabe39319c9f5d47e1d2a2a8b47da4e6418ac oh, how i hate them all!”
0xa3abf0c00dc5332a82d3278ed2e2bf085567695f he fell to musing by what process it could come to pass, that he could be humbled before all of them, indiscriminately--humbled by conviction.
0x8b0a31036a4844e46aff3168a2106200bd19a56a and yet why not?
0xf4bfc6605f842ecb3560f75fa66a16fd5df369b0 it must be so.
0x587dd117ff3de36ff40d06cdadebfe4c4b287135 would not twenty years of continual bondage crush him utterly?
0x3decd14e3a7012e3fc3fa1b7e63bf8f7ec2369ba water wears out a stone.
0x31a5303962509da6a94db5b222045d15d85a75d6 and why, why should he live after that?
0x221b2cd00e47ce3e0afcd6971817c7ec4f7270b4 why should he go now when he knew that it would be so?
0x26820fb4d0af17e3152e76502bb2994e7463a62e it was the hundredth time perhaps that he had asked himself that question since the previous evening, but still he went.
0xd7f3c37ad863dcfed51b7ab907590c38018571a8 chapter viii when he went into sonia’s room, it was already getting dark.
0xedc2ada1d6a86711536289dec7ff6db5299e1a9b all day sonia had been waiting for him in terrible anxiety.
0x5c3801dc6fa73523e200f47d0749515acec3c23d dounia had been waiting with her.
0x498c097d77bdc8039e563dcbbcfb4c4eeb3df3db she had come to her that morning, remembering svidrigaïlov’s words that sonia knew.
0x1e78fa5ae111740226fc1aa9607c1c9f6ce882b3 we will not describe the conversation and tears of the two girls, and how friendly they became.
0xab9be00a55450cbcc26b6503f7050873deaecc7c dounia gained one comfort at least from that interview, that her brother would not be alone.
0xedd66ae59cead89c82ee8bfb5413ec44585a19fc he had gone to her, sonia, first with his confession; he had gone to her for human fellowship when he needed it; she would go with him wherever fate might send him.
0x0f653f002f5e0fab073dc787bcb8ea16421339a9 dounia did not ask, but she knew it was so.
0xeb8dbe2138a10ed68a6c8c5c842f3d9201218210 she looked at sonia almost with reverence and at first almost embarrassed her by it.
0x34affc725ac25183d5893db89b0621f75c9355e6 sonia was almost on the point of tears.
0x646ba0d69ca0e25ec5f0b7bbbd03a5c1e75936b7 she felt herself, on the contrary, hardly worthy to look at dounia.
0x95b3d2962538c1d6581fa37296a9f113b2cc94ae dounia’s gracious image when she had bowed to her so attentively and respectfully at their first meeting in raskolnikov’s room had remained in her mind as one of the fairest visions of her life.
0xb9f93428f43d3f853f89f4c388393e3a8f4e5a3a dounia at last became impatient and, leaving sonia, went to her brother’s room to await him there; she kept thinking that he would come there first.
0xaa4395d1e09442bb0628832934451cdaf98867ad when she had gone, sonia began to be tortured by the dread of his committing suicide, and dounia too feared it.
0x294d083a17635abded1997c61f8d4fab54550421 but they had spent the day trying to persuade each other that that could not be, and both were less anxious while they were together.
0x43c7d347b23e3c4e62819786669d9f89cb1e2b2e as soon as they parted, each thought of nothing else.
0x51f2a094e7f4969a1ce1256d59c40a28244a2a9a sonia remembered how svidrigaïlov had said to her the day before that raskolnikov had two alternatives--siberia or... besides she knew his vanity, his pride and his lack of faith.
0x06422000ef1f29f2aba69e134200e2c78ca523e4 “is it possible that he has nothing but cowardice and fear of death to make him live?”
0xffaa28960dc8fae771da9c69414ff4becc0dac57 she thought at last in despair.
0xc55296c2ca1347a47d65bbb2d8686ea05cb4b15d meanwhile the sun was setting.
0xe62ff823041929aa40f17298c85bbb7450867c84 sonia was standing in dejection, looking intently out of the window, but from it she could see nothing but the unwhitewashed blank wall of the next house.
0xae1d68031630a792a9b5a5147a7372b2c539480b at last when she began to feel sure of his death--he walked into the room.
0xc48dee7007c011b88e416e619ca423463036be83 she gave a cry of joy, but looking carefully into his face she turned pale.
0xdf1efaa39fd57bd57f6eea6dfdf452824bd0bbbc “yes,” said raskolnikov, smiling.
0x4dd309feb2357a280b0ea0904c219b71ad65f90a “i have come for your cross, sonia.
0xa574edefd6b31e8e91a42353399c7909d00d2d39 it was you told me to go to the cross-roads; why is it you are frightened now it’s come to that?”
0x3b67cb9d507e690f5828414b2d831cf091ba22d7 sonia gazed at him astonished.
0x23904a7988a5bd39ad982c4891aa6e92fba2778d his tone seemed strange to her; a cold shiver ran over her, but in a moment she guessed that the tone and the words were a mask.
0x5f0d9608fa0a35831bc49435f27e6fd6dd925afd he spoke to her looking away, as though to avoid meeting her eyes.
0x4cbaad568a1187e0452d3300aefaf6fa28d9f726 “you see, sonia, i’ve decided that it will be better so.
0xaef4dd5f6e893565a054ceab975ba5e3f673a153 there is one fact.... but it’s a long story and there’s no need to discuss it.

0x95b0779badd8627d8d51ea4f41f058fc634f84b1 well, where are the crosses?”
0xd84b7db520d59ef2394d34340f4b04d886348597 he seemed hardly to know what he was doing.
0xc1d4d0f6a8a5e8edaf75189d38ae4c77adcd9b44 he could not stay still or concentrate his attention on anything; his ideas seemed to gallop after one another, he talked incoherently, his hands trembled slightly.
0x89129bfcbd059c0cf504de20c56c5b1ca681d479 without a word sonia took out of the drawer two crosses, one of cypress wood and one of copper.
0x5ab61006ebb636a24558e87beff35968ee3e12c9 she made the sign of the cross over herself and over him, and put the wooden cross on his neck.
0x90483853280066a24969d63a2c4140d853ebdd35 “it’s the symbol of my taking up the cross,” he laughed.
0xa48c88feb3a17d3a22577d7e3644a49bd5e5d5e0 “as though i had not suffered much till now!
0x51e2e02553ae577825e17d14c2f7e26adc099760 the wooden cross, that is the peasant one; the copper one, that is lizaveta’s--you will wear yourself, show me!
0xc1decbfa1fc443c31eee6062f03bc11ceb6b0e44 so she had it on... at that moment?
0x8e028875ecdaff138aa7eff03417906752f479c4 i remember two things like these too, a silver one and a little ikon.
0x57dac8e59851d700e6dd36fb869dd12706e118d6 i threw them back on the old woman’s neck.
0xa29846ed296550564f07b34cc21e9502d8967f4c those would be appropriate now, really, those are what i ought to put on now.... but i am talking nonsense and forgetting what matters; i’m somehow forgetful.... you see i have come to warn you, sonia, so that you might know... that’s all--that’s all i came for.
0x231a57b7f1ed8e4ce5ed9f205d099785d4110525 but i thought i had more to say.
0x924a758787010fc84bd635856071807bd6495b58 you wanted me to go yourself.
0x9fb6c4901cdacf5507b695a1ce3e2e7ba513f6f4 well, now i am going to prison and you’ll have your wish.
0x5cde4d739330a8d50f2409218c2858a03620558a well, what are you crying for?
0xd3bd9d05833653d467586d4f8ffcf6927005528a you too?
0xec8ab6591ac50e12e6c092a4a920bae5c26d4578 don’t.
0x23e1e93a49829dc3a13efcbdcd52f8b0b7cdd083 leave off!
0x9cbfe535075f22c20f2e02347c6c0708050f8f16 oh, how i hate it all!”
0x6f1317d70f4c07339dcef5513e4ab9e89c8ecd97 but his feeling was stirred; his heart ached, as he looked at her.
0x46b1ace131aef9ae719faa540fe85b0f622f2f58 “why is she grieving too?”
0xa3718116e08d6cce7c24113e785d687422bf7f42 he thought to himself.
0x057c6ef4816c8ba5b00ddef1dda6f76ff57bfb81 “what am i to her?
0x68608629f2116ec4fa8e2951a82016d313ac5701 why does she weep?
0x8142c7c61f9cd309290f1ec4c856bc32619b85dd why is she looking after me, like my mother or dounia?
0x1f5fb207ecf46c1debef5750edd8f9247346afbe she’ll be my nurse.”
0x10e9908025fd092a18032c527207fac66d8f8423 “cross yourself, say at least one prayer,” sonia begged in a timid broken voice.
0x4f0e72c9f321ba5fee7cad174fcc113eeb4436d8 “oh certainly, as much as you like!
0xa5a5b90e3d7ee1748261af92d0514cc1a6762cbc and sincerely, sonia, sincerely....” but he wanted to say something quite different.
0x832cd685d9364dd8b153a4715015a0dee3f06aa7 he crossed himself several times.
0x2b155a50073b75695fe6157c6a32d71729c1f420 sonia took up her shawl and put it over her head.
0xec56a8ef5b231bc0d03c628602f39ac773dcf46b it was the green _drap de dames_ shawl of which marmeladov had spoken, “the family shawl.”
0x4583a03f8f26325daff143d6858a8225ee7e811d raskolnikov thought of that looking at it, but he did not ask.
0xa15bbb64309611d3e81677c0fa9046793e6f8552 he began to feel himself that he was certainly forgetting things and was disgustingly agitated.
0x07be5d0e2793439a544f13d5bbe86a2de5fded4f he was frightened at this.
0x2828eb2c5a2db185a1aa15e2a5f53c5d49817822 he was suddenly struck too by the thought that sonia meant to go with him.
0x2f5934ffdd4b3ce168d6add556455b4e522d12e8 “what are you doing?
0x65ba362b5eb9ad98589f784152ef94022c8e83a8 where are you going?
0x7065cafffd8f9ca05fa13264972124bf32f90c44 stay here, stay!
0x5aee9253e952ccaa49b583c12b6be9951c5c68fc i’ll go alone,” he cried in cowardly vexation, and almost resentful, he moved towards the door.
0xc60574c151780ffcdd266c4c0d1daf0a3efa4a01 “what’s the use of going in procession?”
0x9de3f6e9803a995e788dac2043e1b5fd308ce0a8 he muttered going out.
0x1fd5edcf6d8507638bd5d8b772bc6e7bee351c23 sonia remained standing in the middle of the room.
0xa1cd4cabeb8e8c1adb44c43a3ed1c8966bbc6ef2 he had not even said good-bye to her; he had forgotten her.
0x833767c773237f86b8486a58d9404e2d4f17e6bc a poignant and rebellious doubt surged in his heart.
0x659728ec536ce7879cc45807562eccc09c98ae58 “was it right, was it right, all this?”
0x39b8985568d0213fdcf71add37bde4470602747c he thought again as he went down the stairs.
0x0a58859932747589c970a0828495af383498eb76 “couldn’t he stop and retract it all... and not go?”
0xd42083ca15ca6f6d694cad363d2a02bbf0dc266b but still he went.
0x63f3b9ead6699979fd601b30569c47c4539e87d5 he felt suddenly once for all that he mustn’t ask himself questions.
0xa953fb50787c38feab052916a2f328e418437795 as he turned into the street he remembered that he had not said good-bye to sonia, that he had left her in the middle of the room in her green shawl, not daring to stir after he had shouted at her, and he stopped short for a moment.
0x5c7c775aa983149c812202f0324c8e9246764813 at the same instant, another thought dawned upon him, as though it had been lying in wait to strike him then.
0x55561add7641d01d137b6f1c1a5c69f3262bedbf “why, with what object did i go to her just now?
0xe2e57dbc72c451e2a903a8614417c2d4f9c0f988 i told her--on business; on what business?
0xe73252bd77e1a63bfff40facba59c0dace7aab75 i had no sort of business!
0xa0026bdb9af443fe406af97bf229242fbc293b9c to tell her i was _going_; but where was the need?
0xb8b1f3e1a7060b3726a295b365bfc0519bc5b159 do i love her?
0xabcf5d1de73d5eeb86ebf0009ab636defef08ee0 no, no, i drove her away just now like a dog.
0x873993647f181c5f1c61e1f03eb4ddab532b7c21 did i want her crosses?
0xb6fbc338ced2c3fbc225d6da3bc77668d7ab6ecd oh, how low i’ve sunk!
0x5964a02d5f18e52bb1734142ead11a931f4b9f73 no, i wanted her tears, i wanted to see her terror, to see how her heart ached!
0xb0d90c5e9b8385fbc99e78fbab2dc25947de8583 i had to have something to cling to, something to delay me, some friendly face to see!
0x26c32d96c7b5cc74387b8534dd031296da3c25a3 and i dared to believe in myself, to dream of what i would do!
0xe1384359bdedd30c0f7798fad98e657872024220 i am a beggarly contemptible wretch, contemptible!”
0xff273e675b172b3b8e9dbcf7b452f187e51252a5 he walked along the canal bank, and he had not much further to go.
0xddc2d75c58f750a1848f1e9d514af108ae46d6b1 but on reaching the bridge he stopped and turning out of his way along it went to the hay market.
0xa4458b9ea96811e08131c65f1d2cdc4b81da3b11 he looked eagerly to right and left, gazed intently at every object and could not fix his attention on anything; everything slipped away.
0xa02a9bde8508d60f78a168c763b42674ba1fad85 “in another week, another month i shall be driven in a prison van over this bridge, how shall i look at the canal then?
0xcf4cd6a6e57634946bd0d3d88eb3b48b19ec8614 i should like to remember this!”
0xc29e650cf1068156421ec7afff87376c31a9addf slipped into his mind.
0x8a7885209bd684c1b75aca49f11f20af48afb9fd “look at this sign!
0x168db8aad8f430e4f4407e627613756f25b7162b how shall i read those letters then?
0x56f23b2ceddef8d148c7659f8e92f942670cb366 it’s written here ‘campany,’ that’s a thing to remember, that letter _a_, and to look at it again in a month--how shall i look at it then?
0xe64feb9f3320ebda43efc48d7000b2d171bc30e6 what shall i be feeling and thinking then?... how trivial it all must be, what i am fretting about now!
0x3a541455064a0684cb96578d0e0cb6c5ae8ac413 of course it must all be interesting... in its way... (ha-ha-ha!
0xc5de257a7f0582ebb159edde0740d07c9e7d6896 what am i thinking about?)
0x3e4ce81ca733c9c2f3c813a08bc6da7e74ba25ba i am becoming a baby, i am showing off to myself; why am i ashamed?
0x4bf3e335199107182c6f7638efaad377acc7f452 foo!
0x24a356a679427983bbe9b8bf5b51aa91a586f1c4 how people shove!
0x07f0482f8cc757c12d38e5431f530927bec24a6f that fat man--a german he must be--who pushed against me, does he know whom he pushed?
0xb8619ff25d07350d2644d81cf521d7d4831f1b67 there’s a peasant woman with a baby, begging.
0x5ceb97df120a56b1f5899f6d32fcef99cc4e10ab it’s curious that she thinks me happier than she is.
0xb40710c61ad2805653acad16f1640833837fd0ca i might give her something, for the incongruity of it.
0x3e364917a047c85f1a1161b217471bcf1d1731a1 here’s a five copeck piece left in my pocket, where did i get it?
0xe8489bf1887d22134b15f48bbd5813dbce1c52ba here, here... take it, my good woman!”
0xd3f25e4716a1b5af68e9ed35345a6065dc7978d7 “god bless you,” the beggar chanted in a lachrymose voice.
0xcc738870d0b712e9bb6fd45fd074b39c942e14d5 he went into the hay market.
0x0753aeec58eaca4eacc7d1b2bc7deeb7e5d55e5f it was distasteful, very distasteful to be in a crowd, but he walked just where he saw most people.
0xd08c36b4736909efc2b2a0c40b21e03b6d6f7412 he would have given anything in the world to be alone; but he knew himself that he would not have remained alone for a moment.
0x789d8480c8c0ed812c3336d2164ec79177c4e6b1 there was a man drunk and disorderly in the crowd; he kept trying to dance and falling down.
0xb33a0d958f28c46facdf81e51584701604d989dd there was a ring round him.
0x933038459ab57e43dd12c174b35416eacb7837f8 raskolnikov squeezed his way through the crowd, stared for some minutes at the drunken man and suddenly gave a short jerky laugh.
0x515cc641208f4c9be75cd35a96f731907fd742c1 a minute later he had forgotten him and did not see him, though he still stared.
0x91dfe76b97b7b4bcc7b8f318a2aad93771252581 he moved away at last, not remembering where he was; but when he got into the middle of the square an emotion suddenly came over him, overwhelming him body and mind.
0xb0c7da8e045a276663bf1bb5ad659b361979b488 he suddenly recalled sonia’s words, “go to the cross-roads, bow down to the people, kiss the earth, for you have sinned against it too, and say aloud to the whole world, ‘i am a murderer.’” he trembled, remembering that.
0x75f3cdb88c67e319c8131ef1f7d20b9ac86ee87c and the hopeless misery and anxiety of all that time, especially of the last hours, had weighed so heavily upon him that he positively clutched at the chance of this new unmixed, complete sensation.
0x843c29daf0e6e1597a86ab57494029fd0c8ea2ad it came over him like a fit; it was like a single spark kindled in his soul and spreading fire through him.
0x588d21bd9d1bf7a11bb3dff620b00a8e77f3b2a9 everything in him softened at once and the tears started into his eyes.
0x9850108d516fa6440c968b145055dc5a8212608d he fell to the earth on the spot.... he knelt down in the middle of the square, bowed down to the earth, and kissed that filthy earth with bliss and rapture.
0xca218a3bb6c80fe9950c4008344aadccd01b3373 he got up and bowed down a second time.
0x646cf242ae1fdf567daa88091478a912dc40e659 “he’s boozed,” a youth near him observed.
0xd9527c4d1f3272016159788db8d2a8b4c7482341 there was a roar of laughter.
0x255ed4893e1602388d4e90891c88394961bff0b7 “he’s going to jerusalem, brothers, and saying good-bye to his children and his country.
0x77b7f9f8c859c8ccd01b0f5fb25d48433e7b498a he’s bowing down to all the world and kissing the great city of st. petersburg and its pavement,” added a workman who was a little drunk.
0x9491b8d73aaefa26944395863a38f2653a0c72f4 “quite a young man, too!”
0xfb101c23c73f7bc8c438ad3582899f25f7593670 observed a third.
0xd8a293e229f005d3d9f688ab4ba71dd0931fe3ae “and a gentleman,” someone observed soberly.
0x44f76d7f4ffdf8a231174bd2981184bac2b3d527 “there’s no knowing who’s a gentleman and who isn’t nowadays.”
0x26555b03f32030ba580394e087d3e30f1027839a these exclamations and remarks checked raskolnikov, and the words, “i am a murderer,” which were perhaps on the point of dropping from his lips, died away.
0xf16267bce7f7c034da52a4705a0c7091f23974fe he bore these remarks quietly, however, and, without looking round, he turned down a street leading to the police office.
0xbdf3ff1a6035b0c90189326ba26399a2580cb616 he had a glimpse of something on the way which did not surprise him; he had felt that it must be so.
0x98ba021b49242c6998d45c69e936c13a3d07d12a the second time he bowed down in the hay market he saw, standing fifty paces from him on the left, sonia.
0x81f0c2c7b725c53504ba2665c5141005146aa438 she was hiding from him behind one of the wooden shanties in the market-place.
0x393311ef32271c3ee2168442923c089069734680 she had followed him then on his painful way!
0x7ffc2922820549afeef9c0c859eefed491a05b50 raskolnikov at that moment felt and knew once for all that sonia was with him for ever and would follow him to the ends of the earth, wherever fate might take him.
0xae12a2bbbf3bc7d3b86eeaa4abb025492bb9cec6 it wrung his heart... but he was just reaching the fatal place.
0x270b5883333ab09caceb452eef1d6002d98154e6 he went into the yard fairly resolutely.
0xa060a3539539a54f50007a8f553779714b56a82b he had to mount to the third storey.
0x8fdfb1ad1721bb06125b2d3756f8401eedb26e37 “i shall be some time going up,” he thought.
0x3858888e5196b6334c8d274c58e4844ed2102fc5 he felt as though the fateful moment was still far off, as though he had plenty of time left for consideration.
0x46d231aa65b4a6f0c3625965e99250cdc4648a08 again the same rubbish, the same eggshells lying about on the spiral stairs, again the open doors of the flats, again the same kitchens and the same fumes and stench coming from them.
0xcb30c9946741310133393dd9d811fe36aca7a110 raskolnikov had not been here since that day.
0x627b390eb959f0269feb9279f102f00b680df7f1 his legs were numb and gave way under him, but still they moved forward.
0xc028e0feaf10c25d7a4bc3435b99d869aa0648af he stopped for a moment to take breath, to collect himself, so as to enter _like a man_.
0x9c773268f8b9b1ccf422083897b7d74609a8de4b “but why?
0x551dbe9d7356f7fd8c85d9654f4bdb49f8a4b340 what for?”
0xafea0f89cc61ccbc342b2a58165a8bcff561ee40 he wondered, reflecting.
0xaeec231b18b8bdaa877e5add9386c5213bf9bc8b “if i must drink the cup what difference does it make?
0x05ee8a9d498de5fbf5df8850c7ec3abfeabf0f1b the more revolting the better.”
0x30a23e8beb6b07619b66f4cd7c7ccd384adb0de0 he imagined for an instant the figure of the “explosive lieutenant,” ilya petrovitch.
0xa2b78abefb894942fe12d00b4f118009dc94a2f6 was he actually going to him?
0x23a413041e927ebad31080cfbb528cfd0d6725d6 couldn’t he go to someone else?
0x6ccd08a5b495affc137940e32c9b93b80bbc94b9 to nikodim fomitch?
0x4e0971ad56be4294016d1a2313c8286058cb5552 couldn’t he turn back and go straight to nikodim fomitch’s lodgings?
0x9796f814e6bbdeb9e96a39dbec1cbb3a7e67c846 at least then it would be done privately.... no, no!
0x094ffe42f0ec7a59e4b850fc5a8476dd892ebfb4 to the “explosive lieutenant”!
0x18a9ddb618b210a8a9a4de251bdf41443d2bded7 if he must drink it, drink it off at once.
0x772c7704e7803a999408af8325841025ded352aa turning cold and hardly conscious, he opened the door of the office.
0x7de1670c383963acfaf42fd92849eb1b89abb124 there were very few people in it this time--only a house porter and a peasant.
0x8b8da34698229dcf0f184e063a6f595ab7eb5b9f the doorkeeper did not even peep out from behind his screen.
0x7cfdf82b021e29fc9b5a9c4fa04fb7c02c83cd0f raskolnikov walked into the next room.
0x4a54dfca71138ca3d1be626131b1641e226ddd11 “perhaps i still need not speak,” passed through his mind.
0x83e3fea8370c3e53e36939a4fef6795b867b78da some sort of clerk not wearing a uniform was settling himself at a bureau to write.
0xdde3cd22072efeb786a1c394ce150ffaefbc089e in a corner another clerk was seating himself.
0x6229ab29f2be26fcdfab86778f1a2e3e784835b7 zametov was not there, nor, of course, nikodim fomitch.
0x5e81bb06dc0bb9cc7dda6419916620a220b3fc6e “no one in?”

0xd9e27ef118a52ca48678bc0d98dccf92c80eda66 he fancied that a porter pushed past him on his way upstairs to the police office, that a dog in the lower storey kept up a shrill barking and that a woman flung a rolling-pin at it and shouted.

0x4704fc1c60e2c9199d3500f723ead6d23a24ddd1 in the prison the second-class convict rodion raskolnikov has been confined for nine months.
0x5f0756e98ea0648903283e43a224b53aa29df562 almost a year and a half has passed since his crime.
0x81a9303c918c1b7cb080b5641bad140d3f2531bd there had been little difficulty about his trial.
0x13b9c200a09a614b2020b064b598d190661d5c0a the criminal adhered exactly, firmly, and clearly to his statement.
0x87ad0bf5cd24c52836a3bc9fadc3ea8d7790d6fa he did not confuse nor misrepresent the facts, nor soften them in his own interest, nor omit the smallest detail.
0xf659cee5972ad6915d4c6a24790e5e7ac6d0b54d he explained every incident of the murder, the secret of _the pledge_ (the piece of wood with a strip of metal) which was found in the murdered woman’s hand.
0xd66997bc4ec8cceb5f3c141ee831d20f3706554c he described minutely how he had taken her keys, what they were like, as well as the chest and its contents; he explained the mystery of lizaveta’s murder; described how koch and, after him, the student knocked, and repeated all they had said to one another; how he afterwards had run downstairs and heard nikolay and dmitri shouting; how he had hidden in the empty flat and afterwards gone home.
0x77a10e5303fe42cf5e9892f348f17f43023dbdd6 he ended by indicating the stone in the yard off the voznesensky prospect under which the purse and the trinkets were found.
0xda940378e1dc7abe14e2646c8298b9802bed15db the whole thing, in fact, was perfectly clear.
0xc93d8d8b0c8231618e2da4a6d608cd87a2634d01 the lawyers and the judges were very much struck, among other things, by the fact that he had hidden the trinkets and the purse under a stone, without making use of them, and that, what was more, he did not now remember what the trinkets were like, or even how many there were.
0x709c6d7438c42cd28de4f40626ebbd7f0dc72818 the fact that he had never opened the purse and did not even know how much was in it seemed incredible.
0x14b902c5e6f1e1674c5553b8920c45d157eda266 there turned out to be in the purse three hundred and seventeen roubles and sixty copecks.
0xb71ede16f6aec0172caf22109467c0e9f25806b5 from being so long under the stone, some of the most valuable notes lying uppermost had suffered from the damp.
0x7a2c694daef9ae7ac341a559b2bc0339c9194c5d they were a long while trying to discover why the accused man should tell a lie about this, when about everything else he had made a truthful and straightforward confession.
0x5a2c97c251f70d1b1ddeed70ce142dd209fbaee7 finally some of the lawyers more versed in psychology admitted that it was possible he had really not looked into the purse, and so didn’t know what was in it when he hid it under the stone.
0xd7293905e58d0d09e670a79a97b06849e3c59f06 but they immediately drew the deduction that the crime could only have been committed through temporary mental derangement, through homicidal mania, without object or the pursuit of gain.
0x4ecc4f744851cdde5488c28a9f5d8c2f3ac046ab this fell in with the most recent fashionable theory of temporary insanity, so often applied in our days in criminal cases.
0xd1d8babc47a09aeaf6d65fca150b1ef09a53042e moreover raskolnikov’s hypochondriacal condition was proved by many witnesses, by dr. zossimov, his former fellow students, his landlady and her servant.
0x11a44614ed2ebbb816aac7b820b205d94c9021a4 all this pointed strongly to the conclusion that raskolnikov was not quite like an ordinary murderer and robber, but that there was another element in the case.
0x8ca5b3dead5748ef112293bf9b900ff8d53c52b1 to the intense annoyance of those who maintained this opinion, the criminal scarcely attempted to defend himself.
0x97a0ee8072f9f82f32872412a313f83abecc1c94 to the decisive question as to what motive impelled him to the murder and the robbery, he answered very clearly with the coarsest frankness that the cause was his miserable position, his poverty and helplessness, and his desire to provide for his first steps in life by the help of the three thousand roubles he had reckoned on finding.
0xca1dbc6e455780a75f216986161011ed53c6c303 he had been led to the murder through his shallow and cowardly nature, exasperated moreover by privation and failure.
0x1df03b9b403bd55e9f40a5cb123581e7dad04bca to the question what led him to confess, he answered that it was his heartfelt repentance.
0x6a3141538fda150df896d1719f7622ef0e69a738 all this was almost coarse.... the sentence however was more merciful than could have been expected, perhaps partly because the criminal had not tried to justify himself, but had rather shown a desire to exaggerate his guilt.
0x7727186678358d4eb22a683c6ddbe9ef396d119e all the strange and peculiar circumstances of the crime were taken into consideration.
0xf65bdbc5f54846f682888c8e449b1d8e70ff9e43 there could be no doubt of the abnormal and poverty-stricken condition of the criminal at the time.
0x14e519c6b479d2d71a91a22d8f26c819fc561d3a the fact that he had made no use of what he had stolen was put down partly to the effect of remorse, partly to his abnormal mental condition at the time of the crime.
0x4081e13c8a0453aa89d1f9b8860c3ae83dc2d331 incidentally the murder of lizaveta served indeed to confirm the last hypothesis: a man commits two murders and forgets that the door is open!
0xfe1273ab73e69a6d39310ff8ee27b3ffe9572c15 finally, the confession, at the very moment when the case was hopelessly muddled by the false evidence given by nikolay through melancholy and fanaticism, and when, moreover, there were no proofs against the real criminal, no suspicions even (porfiry petrovitch fully kept his word)--all this did much to soften the sentence.
0x36f9b9798a78b448e184337bf666ffc5353713bb other circumstances, too, in the prisoner’s favour came out quite unexpectedly.
0x0cd5043d114f74632167d4ea94b8a60000f2f783 razumihin somehow discovered and proved that while raskolnikov was at the university he had helped a poor consumptive fellow student and had spent his last penny on supporting him for six months, and when this student died, leaving a decrepit old father whom he had maintained almost from his thirteenth year, raskolnikov had got the old man into a hospital and paid for his funeral when he died.
0xcc2cca3f4222a6ec303e36769188ae62a579a0ad raskolnikov’s landlady bore witness, too, that when they had lived in another house at five corners, raskolnikov had rescued two little children from a house on fire and was burnt in doing so.
0xe7c3b93bf8c72a496b791d06fbcbdbe938ee1524 this was investigated and fairly well confirmed by many witnesses.
0x62c77632f6e55c90c30e5d948d3a1944d2964f11 these facts made an impression in his favour.
0x67ca3add0004c9ac49098869ae0529aa3eb452de and in the end the criminal was, in consideration of extenuating circumstances, condemned to penal servitude in the second class for a term of eight years only.
0x0d72cbdb2ed2d17fe519e962c4276471ef1ff7c3 at the very beginning of the trial raskolnikov’s mother fell ill. dounia and razumihin found it possible to get her out of petersburg during the trial.
0x9bed83b101579ca67db7657597c0ddb29c098546 razumihin chose a town on the railway not far from petersburg, so as to be able to follow every step of the trial and at the same time to see avdotya romanovna as often as possible.
0xa9fbd8a778a402ad2ed2d35c3c49d93beff1e9c8 pulcheria alexandrovna’s illness was a strange nervous one and was accompanied by a partial derangement of her intellect.
0x32010c5380d41aaa3a69ae4744f8e8bbac8f0693 when dounia returned from her last interview with her brother, she had found her mother already ill, in feverish delirium.
0x6e0f64cdc44d3d90fffff9d4ce8f3edfb2c0ec98 that evening razumihin and she agreed what answers they must make to her mother’s questions about raskolnikov and made up a complete story for her mother’s benefit of his having to go away to a distant part of russia on a business commission, which would bring him in the end money and reputation.
0x79ad2e4fd952ca32896e029885377160b550f5ed but they were struck by the fact that pulcheria alexandrovna never asked them anything on the subject, neither then nor thereafter.
0xac1e5f93589f50ee82811ba553fafd2d1c72f13d on the contrary, she had her own version of her son’s sudden departure; she told them with tears how he had come to say good-bye to her, hinting that she alone knew many mysterious and important facts, and that rodya had many very powerful enemies, so that it was necessary for him to be in hiding.
0x873886cb95e2b5b7a3d70689d07896d12eebd6bd as for his future career, she had no doubt that it would be brilliant when certain sinister influences could be removed.
0x84f48486f73565ac335ec79a99ceda8ea8e383f6 she assured razumihin that her son would be one day a great statesman, that his article and brilliant literary talent proved it.
0xb06afd1e13c0f5e3b1bc620e5bbba4edc04c9b62 this article she was continually reading, she even read it aloud, almost took it to bed with her, but scarcely asked where rodya was, though the subject was obviously avoided by the others, which might have been enough to awaken her suspicions.
0x0ae49ae03ad6ab50c7540a8d3030e64ed5e41523 they began to be frightened at last at pulcheria alexandrovna’s strange silence on certain subjects.
0xaa25b9908a05f52ad96fe0b96fa8140b17046bf7 she did not, for instance, complain of getting no letters from him, though in previous years she had only lived on the hope of letters from her beloved rodya.
0x0b7f4aa1553c2926acff05d40ad93850e6fed354 this was the cause of great uneasiness to dounia; the idea occurred to her that her mother suspected that there was something terrible in her son’s fate and was afraid to ask, for fear of hearing something still more awful.
0x92e0068f2b3caecf9a38de97a4d517afd69c5fd6 in any case, dounia saw clearly that her mother was not in full possession of her faculties.
0x4b4a4886e843129830acaafbd0d15074405a2f18 it happened once or twice, however, that pulcheria alexandrovna gave such a turn to the conversation that it was impossible to answer her without mentioning where rodya was, and on receiving unsatisfactory and suspicious answers she became at once gloomy and silent, and this mood lasted for a long time.
0x621cc4ed38cc957177d24c9a1bfc9dea5a230fd6 dounia saw at last that it was hard to deceive her and came to the conclusion that it was better to be absolutely silent on certain points; but it became more and more evident that the poor mother suspected something terrible.
0xdd5a94d04abf6fd5adab79ebce34e8229c96b391 dounia remembered her brother’s telling her that her mother had overheard her talking in her sleep on the night after her interview with svidrigaïlov and before the fatal day of the confession: had not she made out something from that?
0xedceca35dcddc2db1041324b8ab1356eb3336a77 sometimes days and even weeks of gloomy silence and tears would be succeeded by a period of hysterical animation, and the invalid would begin to talk almost incessantly of her son, of her hopes of his future.... her fancies were sometimes very strange.
0xc7510e43acd095e9c8731428be148fd7570cbdc1 they humoured her, pretended to agree with her (she saw perhaps that they were pretending), but she still went on talking.
0x6e169e9d15116f1f317193d96da66018d8042583 five months after raskolnikov’s confession, he was sentenced.
0xeeef465a04597d40e2cc352f32d8b0a6a7234905 razumihin and sonia saw him in prison as often as it was possible.
0x28a33031361166080b3215feb94b023fa4c3aff9 at last the moment of separation came.
0x1b5a9f3583bb56c791c4aa8d4fa246fabec3d781 dounia swore to her brother that the separation should not be for ever, razumihin did the same.
0xe5d6078776292aff537cc744cefec6d7dd2acae9 razumihin, in his youthful ardour, had firmly resolved to lay the foundations at least of a secure livelihood during the next three or four years, and saving up a certain sum, to emigrate to siberia, a country rich in every natural resource and in need of workers, active men and capital.
0x6bb9484bcd7f103e929a293736761ef1ed2d38a6 there they would settle in the town where rodya was and all together would begin a new life.
0xf0691df150105288cb544177f865206ba1abf39b they all wept at parting.
0xd613cc069e11bd22717aadad9ce5cc10301c636a raskolnikov had been very dreamy for a few days before.
0xe9c420f2c9a6385a659f38f7932e8134f2f2c399 he asked a great deal about his mother and was constantly anxious about her.
0xc3d8a097efac6bb01d65493f4886e1c5b918388f he worried so much about her that it alarmed dounia.
0x892a4e589fccfeff56c26ae89ddae83e68623a4f when he heard about his mother’s illness he became very gloomy.
0xe6a3c3cf6bd5eb7f63674c0dff8857e8cd4e4951 with sonia he was particularly reserved all the time.
0x3120242ca7d708211c33a20cb07d4049d4dd6917 with the help of the money left to her by svidrigaïlov, sonia had long ago made her preparations to follow the party of convicts in which he was despatched to siberia.
0xd5a71512df177b6813c5b1142339640a5e77d288 not a word passed between raskolnikov and her on the subject, but both knew it would be so.
0x1a60c08ebb3435691056d4228797dc4122dfcbc6 at the final leave-taking he smiled strangely at his sister’s and razumihin’s fervent anticipations of their happy future together when he should come out of prison.
0x3603689df474419ced11327412b7c5af9583cc22 he predicted that their mother’s illness would soon have a fatal ending.
0xdd47af04d95c21d7a67c96368607db13790b37dc sonia and he at last set off.
0xd7f8f3b79a45087478e5fedf32538fd553ed4147 two months later dounia was married to razumihin.
0xec591d0efa9791962bb90bfac47de99901b59e9f it was a quiet and sorrowful wedding; porfiry petrovitch and zossimov were invited however.
0x3e771fcc4d535a431ddf01a9e91f529db8717477 during all this period razumihin wore an air of resolute determination.
0xecd6f3d899f11133aa3ac01262eb30bc2fb3877d dounia put implicit faith in his carrying out his plans and indeed she could not but believe in him.
0xcda17b585b370a5cb6004b374cc255008e9e5f08 he displayed a rare strength of will.
0xa59ac0e84774997f88aefc800b12cd00510d64e1 among other things he began attending university lectures again in order to take his degree.
0xb6ec0cf569105dfa4ced771a7b645466a9419a5d they were continually making plans for the future; both counted on settling in siberia within five years at least.
0x8d4d77f78bedd6e4da0b259f2e5c617675b654ea till then they rested their hopes on sonia.
0x71fc54d3d80305e50abb9bce3e2b41962a91016c pulcheria alexandrovna was delighted to give her blessing to dounia’s marriage with razumihin; but after the marriage she became even more melancholy and anxious.
0xbe9302bd3aacc51acd8ddd99d21412c046bfdb16 to give her pleasure razumihin told her how raskolnikov had looked after the poor student and his decrepit father and how a year ago he had been burnt and injured in rescuing two little children from a fire.
0xc755a7677dc9907c30d922ec07430d32ed58cb6b these two pieces of news excited pulcheria alexandrovna’s disordered imagination almost to ecstasy.
0x59210ce7152e85dce634412570e521137888ba7b she was continually talking about them, even entering into conversation with strangers in the street, though dounia always accompanied her.
0x3a14a70d8c5e33c669e2ca48c89be8fc19315d5c in public conveyances and shops, wherever she could capture a listener, she would begin the discourse about her son, his article, how he had helped the student, how he had been burnt at the fire, and so on!
0xc1a3cb480c8b995819058f1aa11142bdbc639a4f dounia did not know how to restrain her.
0xadeed15e1ac3c2282e918618dba08538e35fd72b apart from the danger of her morbid excitement, there was the risk of someone’s recalling raskolnikov’s name and speaking of the recent trial.
0x76870ed3fd81f13e22f9cc66901065d2db00ced9 pulcheria alexandrovna found out the address of the mother of the two children her son had saved and insisted on going to see her.
0xba3c8d82c7cf6280b07782bb953ae7a2c405bfd0 at last her restlessness reached an extreme point.
0x7dcd219af0cb39da5af30c18c7c0d0cf4e9c57e8 she would sometimes begin to cry suddenly and was often ill and feverishly delirious.
0x438a3ef80348eacd888fef636efd8dc5d99d802b one morning she declared that by her reckoning rodya ought soon to be home, that she remembered when he said good-bye to her he said that they must expect him back in nine months.
0x6089d86fc50e70090daaa7ada4294cb1fc00cb18 she began to prepare for his coming, began to do up her room for him, to clean the furniture, to wash and put up new hangings and so on.
0x3682a6a776c28ba512cebe811ebb724c8b57cceb dounia was anxious, but said nothing and helped her to arrange the room.
0x3fef2e136850b0e057f4636daca7d1dcd038d1ee after a fatiguing day spent in continual fancies, in joyful day-dreams and tears, pulcheria alexandrovna was taken ill in the night and by morning she was feverish and delirious.
0xb46b7f1c8ae8a898800b31c36b8f1bb1607beb34 it was brain fever.
0x94db43900361fe7ad38ea6133366ce28a7c6a727 she died within a fortnight.
0x293ce8cd17b071e128ed2e30ea76a46e1908dda3 in her delirium she dropped words which showed that she knew a great deal more about her son’s terrible fate than they had supposed.
0x4326fadd6bf96c764edc82f67e67558dd49b0dc1 for a long time raskolnikov did not know of his mother’s death, though a regular correspondence had been maintained from the time he reached siberia.
0x02db1d58d38009c01ad4e2cbddce4a4db79f2893 it was carried on by means of sonia, who wrote every month to the razumihins and received an answer with unfailing regularity.
0xb56fc43743ac301508b2d8c2e7c747c5962792f8 at first they found sonia’s letters dry and unsatisfactory, but later on they came to the conclusion that the letters could not be better, for from these letters they received a complete picture of their unfortunate brother’s life.
0x88690c36a84863c2e7ee8c1951fbc6b3a47ecadb sonia’s letters were full of the most matter-of-fact detail, the simplest and clearest description of all raskolnikov’s surroundings as a convict.
0x1a08eef6328f3176eb46f405420584f603890b83 there was no word of her own hopes, no conjecture as to the future, no description of her feelings.
0x6fd0e5ef541f55703ffbc23d76209f17c2b6c731 instead of any attempt to interpret his state of mind and inner life, she gave the simple facts--that is, his own words, an exact account of his health, what he asked for at their interviews, what commission he gave her and so on.
0x39066cb856fc33488acd414415e57a60e7842d3a all these facts she gave with extraordinary minuteness.
0x340683b05b09a6eeb3b73c7a3c5997d5682ac861 the picture of their unhappy brother stood out at last with great clearness and precision.
0x9a6c3b4fb45beaceacd3df551bb22cfdf435494d there could be no mistake, because nothing was given but facts.
0x53e4c94dcf4fa3639aba7605a5e3a3fefcb48968 but dounia and her husband could get little comfort out of the news, especially at first.
0x8bb49720d773bacd0bc0ba9299e2567e71e22950 sonia wrote that he was constantly sullen and not ready to talk, that he scarcely seemed interested in the news she gave him from their letters, that he sometimes asked after his mother and that when, seeing that he had guessed the truth, she told him at last of her death, she was surprised to find that he did not seem greatly affected by it, not externally at any rate.
0x3b286b17d5d35627a386ee138d8f64655c17756d she told them that, although he seemed so wrapped up in himself and, as it were, shut himself off from everyone--he took a very direct and simple view of his new life; that he understood his position, expected nothing better for the time, had no ill-founded hopes (as is so common in his position) and scarcely seemed surprised at anything in his surroundings, so unlike anything he had known before.
0x446924f7f4a4b65361fce37f7cba3351319be17a she wrote that his health was satisfactory; he did his work without shirking or seeking to do more; he was almost indifferent about food, but except on sundays and holidays the food was so bad that at last he had been glad to accept some money from her, sonia, to have his own tea every day.
0x6299ea41a6f09ad2610766b11ce95ec6ea3d211a he begged her not to trouble about anything else, declaring that all this fuss about him only annoyed him.
0xd7d21a7fccdf98e317bec45f5b10f1ee2e755af8 sonia wrote further that in prison he shared the same room with the rest, that she had not seen the inside of their barracks, but concluded that they were crowded, miserable and unhealthy; that he slept on a plank bed with a rug under him and was unwilling to make any other arrangement.
0x6489ae65419b8e1d3aeccdf324a366dcd980ae5a but that he lived so poorly and roughly, not from any plan or design, but simply from inattention and indifference.
0x38bf468b0be3f2c128f0c5e751035abac8ee0b4e sonia wrote simply that he had at first shown no interest in her visits, had almost been vexed with her indeed for coming, unwilling to talk and rude to her.
0x7f53560d9c9b92711b4e4ec0bf5069f65fc91692 but that in the end these visits had become a habit and almost a necessity for him, so that he was positively distressed when she was ill for some days and could not visit him.

0xdd9ea3dd8d54c43c4a44125c25616ead5233e52c on working days she would go to see him at work either at the workshops or at the brick kilns, or at the sheds on the banks of the irtish.
0x6e1105b69140f2635ebc78396c0357a2667d9f2f about herself, sonia wrote that she had succeeded in making some acquaintances in the town, that she did sewing, and, as there was scarcely a dressmaker in the town, she was looked upon as an indispensable person in many houses.
0x90ac28236509f738ad59d4c8373221514988abce but she did not mention that the authorities were, through her, interested in raskolnikov; that his task was lightened and so on.
0x38a7fe92f096da54fac3aace5d86811529cf4463 at last the news came (dounia had indeed noticed signs of alarm and uneasiness in the preceding letters) that he held aloof from everyone, that his fellow prisoners did not like him, that he kept silent for days at a time and was becoming very pale.
0x51eba86d4ac8f646ba3a88f8d2a42a5d70756f92 in the last letter sonia wrote that he had been taken very seriously ill and was in the convict ward of the hospital.
0x1b119608f64d0ac0ad834706566bcf58631cd10e ii he was ill a long time.
0xe972f3bea234f4f4ae68f45974bdedeea6595cfd but it was not the horrors of prison life, not the hard labour, the bad food, the shaven head, or the patched clothes that crushed him.
0x0738c787d9d10fcba8a887b28ed37b1b114c7b51 what did he care for all those trials and hardships!
0x136ba8ad17e80e33eadda9e7002bef98e562e51f he was even glad of the hard work.
0x00f87d6e054c29b4433479dd2bbb78963e8e529e physically exhausted, he could at least reckon on a few hours of quiet sleep.
0x7b408711c7eee82549b7c335fc5fffacef8f8c70 and what was the food to him--the thin cabbage soup with beetles floating in it?
0xc1c181b45974245d2cb2cb3c4894cbc71b653f6b in the past as a student he had often not had even that.
0x9f645dcaca35dbbd0f324b9f714d4f1b4bb38d98 his clothes were warm and suited to his manner of life.
0xccb7363fbcb22b683eee91eed8cc1140947af850 he did not even feel the fetters.
0x286f4c9fe814e501432816bb62c3bf7b47d2cdb4 was he ashamed of his shaven head and parti-coloured coat?
0xc91284b6075806824539f345f027288fe83d9fc3 before whom?
0xa1a1e875988be5792f7b502c7c4e06df715eb10c before sonia?
0x23838567b506686b733d6eb8648d3c9b96fc4472 sonia was afraid of him, how could he be ashamed before her?
0xf804ac3995a9cbe0be64379f9462c5698022a25d and yet he was ashamed even before sonia, whom he tortured because of it with his contemptuous rough manner.
0xeddc821dc4ff4de1fe39002829eda2ac224fff05 but it was not his shaven head and his fetters he was ashamed of: his pride had been stung to the quick.
0xa733bafa4db24e396e3b610a7bbb5d925879ed7f it was wounded pride that made him ill. oh, how happy he would have been if he could have blamed himself!
0xc51521577053baf31b652fdc78c79f33c5e60e9a he could have borne anything then, even shame and disgrace.
0x930eb4c758cbfb1a4403b2a848869a9e0311cff4 but he judged himself severely, and his exasperated conscience found no particularly terrible fault in his past, except a simple _blunder_ which might happen to anyone.
0x90722e8e4af8f7b4176a476e52a9cb4c3ceaee98 he was ashamed just because he, raskolnikov, had so hopelessly, stupidly come to grief through some decree of blind fate, and must humble himself and submit to “the idiocy” of a sentence, if he were anyhow to be at peace.
0x4a5486d25497305680b6214cf2005dcf562e1b0b vague and objectless anxiety in the present, and in the future a continual sacrifice leading to nothing--that was all that lay before him.
0x2b97b5e5ca3e71bbfb53650a05e2ec51a4267153 and what comfort was it to him that at the end of eight years he would only be thirty-two and able to begin a new life!
0x2e51d32af0d2c5eb64200e0621ab982354f3ce39 what had he to live for?
0xa5d80bca57b7661801abbb5744bd7a88dd50d17e what had he to look forward to?
0xb0d1f2c603509478c5d8a97a5a10c9b2eaba2557 why should he strive?
0x873b741a09b0521ef2f4402efc6c64196ead37b6 to live in order to exist?
0xa652416d0ea5c6abc077248043ead59e3a6fc117 why, he had been ready a thousand times before to give up existence for the sake of an idea, for a hope, even for a fancy.
0x396ca261994af8f904a13bb362b7b8f9a9c6bd89 mere existence had always been too little for him; he had always wanted more.
0x03c2ef6fe92cb1d3843ef89dbd3cff396eb5ea2d perhaps it was just because of the strength of his desires that he had thought himself a man to whom more was permissible than to others.
0xc77ea791d1939a90b13468aa0aed3b3720ae47ee and if only fate would have sent him repentance--burning repentance that would have torn his heart and robbed him of sleep, that repentance, the awful agony of which brings visions of hanging or drowning!
0xbe5a53869df53d8399939775485e05e3d7b7fb3a oh, he would have been glad of it!
0x3077b2d911a60b570b90b588d8eb6e96c8a2604b tears and agonies would at least have been life.
0x653468747bd05be99b5c4be228aa27252b873d58 but he did not repent of his crime.
0x94e9d72c527f732d89061667dce9e7a8b7b74077 at least he might have found relief in raging at his stupidity, as he had raged at the grotesque blunders that had brought him to prison.
0x927c706368912cf9e09d0aea3bf5e9a78eb540bc but now in prison, _in freedom_, he thought over and criticised all his actions again and by no means found them so blundering and so grotesque as they had seemed at the fatal time.
0x25be47180fbdaf4d6f61fd36514da27652a200a7 “in what way,” he asked himself, “was my theory stupider than others that have swarmed and clashed from the beginning of the world?
0xa39e5356d0eb87d6ab784841f2efde41209dd5e5 one has only to look at the thing quite independently, broadly, and uninfluenced by commonplace ideas, and my idea will by no means seem so... strange.
0xc3dbe31cfa9671dd0b87118290753ffaa9f0fa8c oh, sceptics and halfpenny philosophers, why do you halt half-way!
0xe7c128ba74ce3c797a29cd78ab9e8b4610e37b45 “why does my action strike them as so horrible?”
0xd47214f8d6c38a7be205fc18171c1d4f05e1bf5f he said to himself.
0x3837833f2e871415496910f54a856e552f07c4b4 “is it because it was a crime?
0xbeb9188004e2a2ca900b2025e1c1ddabff47866a what is meant by crime?
0x0ab566d26ce6409a88802f6fabbb1eeacb1b2095 my conscience is at rest.
0xcb42dbed6f0e39bcaa52519edcf741bcb769b939 of course, it was a legal crime, of course, the letter of the law was broken and blood was shed.
0xb2c6635c0d20c3dd01c069b7f3a35712bae220e2 well, punish me for the letter of the law... and that’s enough.
0x588b5b8031e8084f2e9852a1e3a5405e9510c58e of course, in that case many of the benefactors of mankind who snatched power for themselves instead of inheriting it ought to have been punished at their first steps.
0x0fb03bc2fcfee479319228814aef799858f3a61c but those men succeeded and so _they were right_, and i didn’t, and so i had no right to have taken that step.”
0xa606af2a5495c61649ea5f5ca9bf2e97a99e15db it was only in that that he recognised his criminality, only in the fact that he had been unsuccessful and had confessed it.
0xa69e0a05bc8b81fa5929c95c3e52c811f2205d5d he suffered too from the question: why had he not killed himself?
0xe7452d5a67785a0e3863c69c1ac4289585750a03 why had he stood looking at the river and preferred to confess?
0x68f03458fc671509ed7fb0d28e34a241ec789982 was the desire to live so strong and was it so hard to overcome it?
0x6ea9a264ee12211c7318e9452ec17c8a8c9b2a03 had not svidrigaïlov overcome it, although he was afraid of death?
0xf47854eb7406937e5ee7fd73aedceab28704d7da in misery he asked himself this question, and could not understand that, at the very time he had been standing looking into the river, he had perhaps been dimly conscious of the fundamental falsity in himself and his convictions.
0x17243eb2f2277aefbfeb900fecd4f967323aa9b4 he didn’t understand that that consciousness might be the promise of a future crisis, of a new view of life and of his future resurrection.
0xda6f9e67a620fd32e99281ac5c5f90fba584b5a7 he preferred to attribute it to the dead weight of instinct which he could not step over, again through weakness and meanness.
0x9351f55777214eb2b926252855d6213124351e99 he looked at his fellow prisoners and was amazed to see how they all loved life and prized it.
0x9d46d3ed466e280431e25f10c36b3dc385504adc it seemed to him that they loved and valued life more in prison than in freedom.
0xfa00fa59df5be068920c8c7fa357ad3e8bd97151 what terrible agonies and privations some of them, the tramps for instance, had endured!
0x013ba4015aa140016f984c2a4d136468d442d69c could they care so much for a ray of sunshine, for the primeval forest, the cold spring hidden away in some unseen spot, which the tramp had marked three years before, and longed to see again, as he might to see his sweetheart, dreaming of the green grass round it and the bird singing in the bush?
0x16ec10b0decdccbf363d9088b3f33badb8d0c5fe as he went on he saw still more inexplicable examples.
0x2f6ebce238b35f4ab75f5045600a03abd9c0c7ae in prison, of course, there was a great deal he did not see and did not want to see; he lived as it were with downcast eyes.
0xbe4672720a0da1303f27f4bf521b6b2e7af8636b it was loathsome and unbearable for him to look.
0xff95f64de15712ab97589a1f4379e99da5c696af but in the end there was much that surprised him and he began, as it were involuntarily, to notice much that he had not suspected before.
0xdc0e1094213208956ac4fda85cf3588dbab26cde what surprised him most of all was the terrible impossible gulf that lay between him and all the rest.
0xaa503766192971bd9d22fba98d0500e0815591a0 they seemed to be a different species, and he looked at them and they at him with distrust and hostility.
0x021f464501a301fd8b3d7c597ba53bed0e768264 he felt and knew the reasons of his isolation, but he would never have admitted till then that those reasons were so deep and strong.
0x13c6b0330c871d293d287b1964ef46860cfa7f06 there were some polish exiles, political prisoners, among them.
0x47d05dd2604206df066640a136a819d0304aadc5 they simply looked down upon all the rest as ignorant churls; but raskolnikov could not look upon them like that.
0x0008109c91a2bdaa09a37ff0a8119fb0fe54b5c2 he saw that these ignorant men were in many respects far wiser than the poles.
0x9031a2cf8d199b8bb0b2eeb88c89fa1f36d90316 there were some russians who were just as contemptuous, a former officer and two seminarists.
0xa5fbc62da657538bea4a06f35a7cacf01b9d79e8 raskolnikov saw their mistake as clearly.
0x12a434bd7bdd8ca259ffe7fb5d59878a85f1b3b5 he was disliked and avoided by everyone; they even began to hate him at last--why, he could not tell.
0x2112f88ee2aaf45034845766f5137149bd759911 men who had been far more guilty despised and laughed at his crime.
0x30f6d55d689882c1456d81af7a7c4ecd3bde4481 “you’re a gentleman,” they used to say.
0x99213e61f97a4373f36e55f630b0b08ac90a1454 “you shouldn’t hack about with an axe; that’s not a gentleman’s work.”
0x870317614953d25b837c685f4d828149b8738092 the second week in lent, his turn came to take the sacrament with his gang.
0x93370ec53e378d2a4c08d9dc136743cdb44c6fd3 he went to church and prayed with the others.
0xe4263b65adc9990eadb84809debb144023065e21 a quarrel broke out one day, he did not know how.
0x64ac43714187abe91ca9e89513847ae7d7069249 all fell on him at once in a fury.
0x9262f33c90ad3d4380d698b7be4d49ad7b1c2878 “you’re an infidel!
0x98bf44fd96171c645b8ed6b1146049aec3aaa3c2 you don’t believe in god,” they shouted.
0x5b237db80655638d28715de2083c17d7bd42214d “you ought to be killed.”
0xe5e2157a6fb4c2a875fd6a460f30d54868500936 he had never talked to them about god nor his belief, but they wanted to kill him as an infidel.
0xe08a17a3811ea97d44c7441ffe4c77ffd2d7ba2c he said nothing.
0x12cf6c2c7cee596bec3c865c8b9e71dd03a0f679 one of the prisoners rushed at him in a perfect frenzy.
0xb72f1e386a5f3a494249f0a685a273e586447dbc raskolnikov awaited him calmly and silently; his eyebrows did not quiver, his face did not flinch.
0x6c76289ddb7ac7bb0c517d9db4fd135a5c007bae the guard succeeded in intervening between him and his assailant, or there would have been bloodshed.
0x3e8ae32dd215d5081460c65b34a6f70e18f7ee42 there was another question he could not decide: why were they all so fond of sonia?
0x019b8943afc4f49fb9dd3598f03975610355a85e she did not try to win their favour; she rarely met them, sometimes only she came to see him at work for a moment.
0x3e52f818ab435dd23eb99664a21e02004d7b4b26 and yet everybody knew her, they knew that she had come out to follow _him_, knew how and where she lived.
0x7a885638eeb33f09d7a681a5f1b5e3be319ea964 she never gave them money, did them no particular services.
0x7d1eed31fea9863cf62e0d3da789e413eeec3ff3 only once at christmas she sent them all presents of pies and rolls.
0x2f74584f075ae5f65bba7b03ff8e9586f34e1767 but by degrees closer relations sprang up between them and sonia.
0xf2f2f054e4ddd93d8b055c6f9150f6d313a59f39 she would write and post letters for them to their relations.
0x4392fb2fc06acd31f9216259d8c7eebd1860d2e2 relations of the prisoners who visited the town, at their instructions, left with sonia presents and money for them.

0xb0a0f7b36a0f9abf953f158848bf461a082ee316 and when she visited raskolnikov at work, or met a party of the prisoners on the road, they all took off their hats to her.
0xdfb6d517ff337b9bb2246486f14904da6142c532 “little mother sofya semyonovna, you are our dear, good little mother,” coarse branded criminals said to that frail little creature.
0x90a02775edd9f2850495c2f380dea9b6faa121c6 she would smile and bow to them and everyone was delighted when she smiled.
0x8ab5102cdae8d04492db06ff4e12d6373ea49adb they even admired her gait and turned round to watch her walking; they admired her too for being so little, and, in fact, did not know what to admire her most for.
0x83191a75306fa311ad7e43034dd6eb3c4ccedfab they even came to her for help in their illnesses.

0x81f3e0d566563981ba79d2c6335a60e90212ac49 she seemed to be waiting for someone.
0x853202474e8cfa0696ec19f58057799b716fea94 something stabbed him to the heart at that minute.
0x98b1dcf187b54a2d703958d08cb7c6e9e1cba5ef he shuddered and moved away from the window.
0x1590838a9461929fe1083872d64b614e17d18b3b next day sonia did not come, nor the day after; he noticed that he was expecting her uneasily.
0x5590a1f4e5a360e31f9c4f5d0a1d9b6922d59cd3 at last he was discharged.
0x5806d49e33fceff1bb42af1fbd8cf9dc07257c15 on reaching the prison he learnt from the convicts that sofya semyonovna was lying ill at home and was unable to go out.
0xd41c80fcb687f83b83d6076cf181ada6104f8ae9 he was very uneasy and sent to inquire after her; he soon learnt that her illness was not dangerous.
0xd9eca68c611e1879586e246b82c160dbce711881 hearing that he was anxious about her, sonia sent him a pencilled note, telling him that she was much better, that she had a slight cold and that she would soon, very soon come and see him at his work.
0x8330b252de038386752177c647161a0090f59165 his heart throbbed painfully as he read it.
0xb673067c228b231ff6bfefe36255b3488c5e1c80 again it was a warm bright day.
0x3d97ce5e43600c9b6195b2d9b9e36407c54fa81f early in the morning, at six o’clock, he went off to work on the river bank, where they used to pound alabaster and where there was a kiln for baking it in a shed.
0x40fc853bace0bcc2983a49c410e3c9939efe5b9c there were only three of them sent.
0xef2f2ad0797d1e2e348d202dfbec7a41bc39614f one of the convicts went with the guard to the fortress to fetch a tool; the other began getting the wood ready and laying it in the kiln.
0x5f58dffaee1697605da7038108270be3a924b241 raskolnikov came out of the shed on to the river bank, sat down on a heap of logs by the shed and began gazing at the wide deserted river.
0x0c157ad2c8e5dc8ee5fbeec259bd868a8bd18735 from the high bank a broad landscape opened before him, the sound of singing floated faintly audible from the other bank.
0xdbb8209d4a17959ce5131f6c7654b350f25443e2 in the vast steppe, bathed in sunshine, he could just see, like black specks, the nomads’ tents.
0x8feb0708d5ba6090157a6d9c9a624f6e75aff8e9 there there was freedom, there other men were living, utterly unlike those here; there time itself seemed to stand still, as though the age of abraham and his flocks had not passed.
0x83d87710755199f41b13a0e428bdf65a1d746a4f raskolnikov sat gazing, his thoughts passed into day-dreams, into contemplation; he thought of nothing, but a vague restlessness excited and troubled him.
0xcfe5265901bbf526033c9ff5d211a45bc7061d01 suddenly he found sonia beside him; she had come up noiselessly and sat down at his side.
0x53991a1de7dc11e7da37ebaa831a97c712982a2e it was still quite early; the morning chill was still keen.
0xe059fa39dfeb23b09287a9aee34c91a088379ebd she wore her poor old burnous and the green shawl; her face still showed signs of illness, it was thinner and paler.
0xf88e4deac58d623343d356a26fde5d18f227e5a5 she gave him a joyful smile of welcome, but held out her hand with her usual timidity.
0x9c04ed0df4dbb011af6771ca08b5e73aa851e99b she was always timid of holding out her hand to him and sometimes did not offer it at all, as though afraid he would repel it.
0x92d73dc3df24cc4965b0230fb7e3c3149336fb95 he always took her hand as though with repugnance, always seemed vexed to meet her and was sometimes obstinately silent throughout her visit.
0x58e539fd2eb489e684a4ac026b0e919b906bf0ca sometimes she trembled before him and went away deeply grieved.
0x2d038be805c0f52535076767cf0028ad9ac4697c but now their hands did not part.
0x9e5a8fd27b6493571f5e5e7dfd11b07b6508fc21 he stole a rapid glance at her and dropped his eyes on the ground without speaking.
0x576f191c1fd21d0f7b162040afcb1e935ae38f37 they were alone, no one had seen them.
0x71e460f0fd5681e14be3a6cab6347e9f07c1a742 the guard had turned away for the time.
0x99b069abf644d2ee435d59695a7bf12e1a6d19e9 how it happened he did not know.
0x33c400afecfa93bb4c434104bbe232743d086207 but all at once something seemed to seize him and fling him at her feet.
0x7c6bfe44a04e45bae684fbdc4103de1355e1b40d he wept and threw his arms round her knees.
0x8128626156d362fc568994db444f2e446a3890a3 for the first instant she was terribly frightened and she turned pale.
0x250ac3c330798f970a03e46aad1cf0c5b0062034 she jumped up and looked at him trembling.
0x8af546fe1434b9079e67fc5637a183329948f6dd but at the same moment she understood, and a light of infinite happiness came into her eyes.
0x3ca12f496bd57de11814db6632ddda8d30875df2 she knew and had no doubt that he loved her beyond everything and that at last the moment had come.... they wanted to speak, but could not; tears stood in their eyes.
0xaab80ceb242a68e35d2d0a2b9046e66d72162626 they were both pale and thin; but those sick pale faces were bright with the dawn of a new future, of a full resurrection into a new life.
0x1c7c9e0c99d6a8c43b2728f1a98d8aa92e0077fe they were renewed by love; the heart of each held infinite sources of life for the heart of the other.
0x62a2c66f4bf8057fe3d0b5dc4271d5cda2721620 they resolved to wait and be patient.
0xee753daf3d1d61874847982e5d60b6f275394f91 they had another seven years to wait, and what terrible suffering and what infinite happiness before them!
0xd17ef6d7546712cf6e2ed69a1063d0bb5881a7d2 but he had risen again and he knew it and felt it in all his being, while she--she only lived in his life.
0x1959133d613b34bf26848fa1a1d7a4258e8ac203 on the evening of the same day, when the barracks were locked, raskolnikov lay on his plank bed and thought of her.
0x885f9d2753def0913e2d0bf6e694386a94af5c25 he had even fancied that day that all the convicts who had been his enemies looked at him differently; he had even entered into talk with them and they answered him in a friendly way.
0x2c38e3c583455db4266dc185059a9f0655235435 he remembered that now, and thought it was bound to be so.
0xebe7206a64fec591562de5d000596a90d4973311 wasn’t everything now bound to be changed?
0xb976eb44a016031964d5c0e52f2f586fbd199e27 he thought of her.
0x25d633311d43a795984ddcc71773fdff997d13ea he remembered how continually he had tormented her and wounded her heart.
0xdc59c417e23ec2b9a75f4e72a882d1fb51cf2e91 he remembered her pale and thin little face.
0x68b1a59c44983d6d6f4aafbde969e2d727215b75 but these recollections scarcely troubled him now; he knew with what infinite love he would now repay all her sufferings.
0x69d5f27fb88bf6dd4e7a8da59fd530f95eaa7395 and what were all, _all_ the agonies of the past!
0xf868a61eb84b2f4bc858534242c311a503aedbde everything, even his crime, his sentence and imprisonment, seemed to him now in the first rush of feeling an external, strange fact with which he had no concern.
0x92d34ab9e36300b18b22d0ce40e5c1ab5de8f9fd but he could not think for long together of anything that evening, and he could not have analysed anything consciously; he was simply feeling.
0x44a8cdf4496f6a291bc3210b37109706053c132f life had stepped into the place of theory and something quite different would work itself out in his mind.

0xcd2ad0b0e9eca5d6fd010f6599827289a013821e at first he was afraid that she would worry him about religion, would talk about the gospel and pester him with books.
0x37109b43e52c61a56f9b6e7de0f3b04b9171c360 but to his great surprise she had not once approached the subject and had not even offered him the testament.
0x42a27816d856eb95a453877d70c2135d495cfee7 he had asked her for it himself not long before his illness and she brought him the book without a word.
0xbfd47e53516c4da2945f7b4bae8f5371b5dde556 till now he had not opened it.
0xb62b67c7337ef5e977bd9b27ed789b5fcaf25f3f he did not open it now, but one thought passed through his mind: “can her convictions not be mine now?

0xaf75088bbb4bb958f967cb1062497c33782eb844 but she was so happy--and so unexpectedly happy--that she was almost frightened of her happiness.
0x4ec7fd48d5637afb34ba48bd944dca70222ca8cd seven years, _only_ seven years!
0x843d44b3a1c75f9da0d9dda9cb377f0c9dbbc56f at the beginning of their happiness at some moments they were both ready to look on those seven years as though they were seven days.
